## Designing search and filter.

Monster Page Configurations.

Listing out all of the ways a monster can be made distinct.

Some examples:

All (most?) dragons have 12 distinct statblocks, one for each age category. When filtering, we ultimately want to be able to see "Dragon, Chromatic, Red, Adult" and it's AC of -5, 35% magic resistance, and 15,000 XP.   

- Full page, single statblock (aarakocr)
- Full page, multi statblock
- Full page, single statblock, multi hit dice
- Full page, multi statblock, multi hit dice (orc)
  - The multi hit dice stats will be tricky, since their stats are usually mentioned in the body text. It sure would be cool to have "Orc, Subchief, Leader" and "Orc, Shaman, 5th" show up with stats. 

There are monster pages that mention variants with greater hit dice, like aarakath, and they are not included in the statblock. Not sure what to do with that. Stretch goal probably.
