  <p class="f">How chimerae were created is a dark mystery better left unexplored. The chimera has the hindquarters of a large, black goat and the forequarters of a huge, tawny <a href="catgreat.html">lion</a>. Its body has brownish-black wings like those of a <a href="dragon.html">dragon</a>.</p>
  <p>The monster has three heads, those of a goat, a lion, and a fierce dragon. The goat head is pitch black, with glowing amber eyes and long ochre horns. The lion head is framed by a brown mane and has green eyes. The dragon head is covered with orange scales and has black eyes.</p>
  <p>The chimera speaks a limited form of the foul language of <a href="dragcred.html">red dragons</a>. As a rule, however, it will only pause to communicate with those creatures who are more powerful than itself.</p>
  <p class="f"><b>Combat:</b> Its many heads and powerful physique make the chimera a deadly foe in combat. The monster prefers to surprise its victims, often swooping down upon them from the sky. It can attack 6 times each round, clawing with its forelegs, goring with its two horns, and biting with its lion and dragon heads. If it desires to do so, the dragon head can loose a stream of flame some 5 yards long in lieu of biting. The dragon's fire causes 3-24 (3d8) points damage, although a saving throw vs. breath weapon will cut the damage in half. The chimera will always attempt to breathe if its opponents are in range. If more than 1 chimera is encountered, they will attack in concert.</p>
  <p>The armor classes are split as follows: Dragon, AC 2 (flank); Lion, AC 5 (front); Goat, AC 6 (rear).</p>
  <p class="f"><b>Habitat/Society:</b> The chimera, being a hybrid, combines the preferences of the lion, the goat, and the dragon in its habitat, society and ecology. The dragonish part of its nature gives the chimera a distinct preference for caves as lairs. The dragon and lion parts seem to war with one another, for some chimerae are dragon-like in their preference for solitude, while others live in small prides. Even if they mate, offspring are rare.</p>
  <p>The monster is an omnivore. The goat head will browse on the toughest plants and shrubs and will derive nutrition from the most barren vegetation while the lion and dragon heads can only be satisfied with flesh. The chimera hunts once every 3 or 4 days, using its strength and limited intelligence to gain an advantage over those it preys on. Having a voracious appetite, it sometimes roams over territories as large as 20 square miles.</p>
  <p>Being chaotic evil in nature, the chimera enjoys preying upon men, <a href="elf.html">elves</a>, <a href="dwarf.html">dwarves</a>, and <a href="halfling.html">halflings</a>. It will even gladly attack other monsters in its search for food. Anyone entering its territory becomes prey, and will be treated accordingly.</p>
  <p>The chimera cannot resist attacking groups of travelers or monsters for another reason: its dragon nature craves the treasure that its prey might be carrying. Although it has no earthly use for it, the chimera will gather the coins of its fallen foe into a heap and roost on it like a dragon. Its hoard is nothing like that of a true dragon, however, and consists mainly of copper and silver coins, with perhaps some jewelry and a few magical items.</p>
  <p class="f"><b>Ecology:</b> The chimera fills the role of both omnivore and a top predator in its ecosystem. It is very adaptable. During times when its prey is scarce or non-existent, the chimera can make do with a vegetarian diet.</p>
  <p class="f"><b>Gorgimera</b></p>  <p class="ni">The gorgimera has the hindquarters of a <a href="gorgon.html">gorgon</a>, forequarters of a lion, and body and wings of a red dragon. Like the chimera, it has the heads of its three constituent creatures.</p>
  <p>The monster can attack with its claws, bite with its lion and dragon heads, and butt with its gorgon head. In place of making its normal attack, the gorgon and dragon heads can employ their breath weapons. While the dragon's attack is similar to that of the chimera, the gorgon's breath causes petrification to any caught in its area of effect. The gorgon head can use its breath weapon twice per day to strike in a cone 3 feet long which is 1 foot wide at its base and 3 feet wide at its mouth. The gorgimera will always use one of its breath weapons if its foes are within 10 feet. A save vs. petrification will allow a victim to avoid the effects of the gorgon's breath.</p>
  <p>The gorgon's head can see into both the Astral and Ethereal planes, and its breath weapon extends therein.</p>
  <p>Like its relative the chimera, the gorgimera can also speak a limited form of the language of red dragons.</p>
