  <p class="ni"><b>Psychometabolism -</b> <i>Sciences:</i> nil; <i>Devotion:</i> enhancement.</p>
  <p class="ni"><b>Metapsionics -</b> <i>Sciences:</i> nil; <i>Devotion:</i> psionic sense.</p>
  <p class="ni"><b>Telepathy -</b> <i>Science:</i> psionic crush; <i>Devotions:</i> mind thrust, psionic blast.</p>
  <p class="ni">There is a 10% chance that Su-monsters will have one more science and two more devotions in the psychometabolic discipline. Enhancement and Psionic Sense are used at no cost, and Psionic Sense is always on.</p>
  <p class="f">Su-monsters look like big gray monkeys, 4 to 5 feet tall. They have large bones and muscular limbs, but they always appear a bit underfed, because their ribs and vertebrae show prominently. Their long, prehensile tails can easily support their weight. Their hands and feet are virtually alike, each having three long, thick fingers and an opposable thumb, all equipped with claws. Like the tail, their hands and feet are very strong, allowing them to hang by one limb for several hours. Short, dirty gray fur covers most of their body. Their face and tail are black, while their paws are always bloody red (making them look like they just finished killing something, which is the case more often than not). They frequently grin, but this is usually a sharp-toothed threat rather than a gesture of friendliness.</p>
  <p class="f"><b>Combat:</b> Su-monsters attack with all four legs when possible, raking their extremely sharp nails across their victim. They can also deliver a powerful bite with their canine-like mouth. These creatures like to hunt in small packs (1d12 members). Their favorite hunting grounds are well-traveled trails through the jungle/forest. They search for a sturdy branch overhanging a trail, and perch in the trees, waiting patiently. When a victim passes beneath them, they an swing down, using their tails as anchors. This way they can attack with all four claws plus the bite. Victims of this kind of ambush suffer a -4 penalty to their surprise rolls.</p>
  <p>What really makes these beasts ferocious is their tribal protectiveness. Half the time (50% chance), the entire family takes part in the hunt: male, female, and two young. If the young are attacked or threatened, the females fight as if under a <i>haste</i> spell (i.e., double movement and number of attacks). Likewise, if the they females are attacked, the males appear to fight with <i>haste</i>. A surge of adrenaline accounts for this ferocity. Females can maintain the effect for up to 6 turns (an hour), and males can maintain it for up to 4 turns. Psionically these creatures can be deadly. They know three attack modes. They are also impervious to telepathic attacks. When su-monsters are using enhancement, they can attack both psionically and physically if they choose (instead of a double attack rate).</p>
  <p class="f"><b>Habitat/Society:</b> A su-monster family is composed of two parents (adult male and female) and two young. When two or more families live together, they form a clan. Su-monsters are very territorial and have a particular hatred for the psionically empowered.</p>
  <p>According to legend, su-monsters were created by a powerful evil cleric or mage, who wished to guard his forest from intruders (especially psionic ones). The creatures do make a formidable attack force, which tends to support this theory. According to some sages the creatures are magical hybrid of humanoids and apes. In any event, many evil wizards and priests employ su-monsters as forest guards today.</p>
  <p class="f"><b>Ecology:</b> Su-monsters keep their valuables well hidden in the high boles of the trees in their territory. They have no food value, since their meat is mildly poisonous. Characters who eat su-monster meat must save vs. poison or become ill, and no natural healing is possible for 1 week.</p>
