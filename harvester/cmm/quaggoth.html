  <p class="f">Quaggoths are humanoids with long, shaggy, white hair covering their entire bodies. They wear no clothing. Warlike and vicious, they roam the Underdark looking for prey. <a href="elfdrow.html">Drow</a> sometimes enslave them as guards and <a href="spider.html">spider</a> handlers.</p>
  <p>Quaggoths speak a halting form of Undercommon, and can grasp only simple concepts. More intelligent quaggoths may also speak a few words of <a href="dwarduer.html">Duergar</a>, Drow, or Common.</p>
  <p>These aggressive beasts have infravision with a range of 120'. They are immune to all poisons.</p>
  <p class="f"><b>Combat:</b> Quaggoth tribes claim a certain territory as theirs and patrol it, hunting for food. Any detected animals or creatures (such as a party of adventurers) invite certain attack.</p>
  <p>Most tribes (70%) of quaggoths do not carry weapons, and attack with their claws for 1-4 hit points of damage per hit. The remainder of quaggoth tribes carry stone clubs or axes. Those quaggoths which are or have been drow slaves carry superior weapons, such as steel battle axes or two-handed swords. </p>
  <p>If a quaggoth is reduced to 25% or less of its original hit points, it enters a berserk fury and receives a +2 bonus to its attack and damage rolls. This rage lasts until the quaggoth dies or all enemies are dead or out of sight.</p>
  <p>For every 12 quaggoths encountered, there will be a leader, or jald. The jald has 3+3 Hit Dice and wears leather or skins, making it AC 5. In addition, it gains a +1 bonus to damage rolls. Jalds direct combat; if no jald is present, the quaggoths will fall upon their prey, whatever it is, in an unorganized manner.</p>
  <p>Any quaggoth tribe has a 20% chance of having one or two thonots. A thonot is the quaggoth equivalent of a shaman. Instead of magic, however, thonots use psionics. A thonot will use its abilities to aid the tribe in combat, escape, or healing.</p>
  <p>If quaggoths win combat, they take all bodies, including those of dead quaggoths, to their lair and devour them.</p>
  <p class="f"><b>Habitat/Society:</b> Quaggoths are nomadic hunters. They change territories periodically. In each new territory, they claim a central cave as a lair, leaving treasure with a few guards. The rest of the tribe hunts, returning periodically to rest and change guards.</p>
  <p>Females are equal to males in numbers and abilities in a quaggoth tribe. For every adult quaggoth, there will be one young. Half of these young are unable to attack or defend; the other half have 1+1 HD and the same AC and attacks as adults.</p>
  <p>Thonots control what passes for religious life among quaggoths. They oversee what few rituals there are; those rituals which are known include the daily preparation for hunting, coming of age, and death (a brief whistling to send the spirit away before the rest of the quaggoths eat the body).</p>
  <p>Quaggoths can mate at any time of the year. They are not known to have any courtship or mating rituals. Young are born about 10 months after mating. Births are usually singular, but twins are not uncommon.</p>
  <p>The origin of quaggoths is unknown. Some sages claim that they were once a semi-civilized race which dominated much of the Underdark through conquest and ritual sacrifice, until the drow, duergar, and other races broke their power. Others speculate they had some sort of civilization on the surface and were driven underground; this theory is supported by the quaggoths' hatred for surface-dwelling <a href="dwarf.html">dwarves</a> and <a href="elf.html">elves</a>.</p>
  <p class="f"><b>Ecology:</b> Quaggoths produce a few artifacts, mostly crudely carved stone items. A few seem to be talented at making necklaces with wooden, bone, or stone beads.</p>
  <p>Quaggoths fear no creature. Though they are dangerous hunters, they are just as often prey for other predators of the Underdark. Quaggoths can be trained as servants and guards if captured early.</p>
