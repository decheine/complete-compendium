  <p class="f">The trilling crysmal is a close relative of the <a href="elekechr.html">crysmal</a> (Monster Manual II) and is uncommon in the elemental plane of Earth. In the <a href="quaelege.html">quasi-plane</a> of Mineral, however, the trilling crysmal is quite common, for here they live in great numbers, hunting along the boundary zone with the Positive Material plane.</p>
  <p class="f"><b>Combat:</b> In appearance, the trilling crysmal looks very different from a crysmal. It possesses six long, acicular legs radiating from a central crystal mass. Dominating this "body" is a huge silvery crystal almost 4' high. The entire creature is exceedingly hard, and only weapons of +2 enchantment or better can inflict damage. Lesser weapons have a 10% chance of shattering upon impact with a trilling crysmal.</p>
  <p>The trilling crysmal has two methods of attack. The first is a slashing attack using its razor-edged legs (two at most against each opponent, engaging up to three opponents if surrounded). Each leg inflicts 1d8 hp damage. As a secondary weapon, the trilling crysmal can shoot up to six crystal barbs per day. These crystalline darts have ridged, diamond-hard edges that can penetrate the toughest of armor. Darts that successfully hit will inflict 1d4 + 1 hp damage. The darts have a range equal to a light crossbow.</p>
  <p>Additionally, these barbs have a devastating side effect. Moments after striking an opponent, the dart shatters into 3d4 sharp splinters. These splinters cause agonizing pain that is so intense that victims temporarily lose two points of strength and four points of dexterity. Any violent movement (running, combat, etc.) that the victim performs will inflict 1d6 hp damage per round until the splinters are removed. Removal inflicts 1 hp damage per splinter, unless a <i>cure wounds</i> spell of any sort is used to neutralize these barbs. Such a spell will eliminate all of the splinters within any one victim.</p>
  <p>As a special defense vs. spells cast directly on the trilling crysmal by characters or from devices, this being employs its great central crystal, Using this crystal as a double prism, this being has a 75% chance to "reflect" any spell cast directly on its body. The reflected spell will manifest in a random direction from one of the six facets (roll 1d6 and choose a "hexagonal" direction). The spells activating distance will be (1d4 X 10)+20 feet away from the trilling crysmal, affecting any creature within the spell's area of effect. This spell reflection does not influence area-effect spells (<i>e.g., cloudkill</i>), unless the center of such a spell is located directly upon the trilling crysmal.</p>
