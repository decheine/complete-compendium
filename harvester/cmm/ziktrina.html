  <p class="f">Like the <a href="tohrkre2.html">zik-trin'ta</a> scout (called <a href="tohrkre1.html">tohr-kreen</a> in the Tablelands), the zik-trin'ak warrior is a creature created from normal kreen. The zik-trin'ak looks much like a normal <a href="thrikree.html">thri-kreen</a> or <a href="tohrkre3.html">tohr-kreen</a>, but is larger and more dangerous. The zik-trin'ak stands as tall as 10 feet and is as long as 13 feet.</p>
  <p>The zik-trin'ak is built for combat; the claws are longer end sharper than those of a normal kreen, and the exoskeleton is ornamented with spikes, knobs, and other protrusions. Though most zik-trin'ak have yellow exoskeletons (having been made from To'ksa thri-kreen), some have black shells, end a few are red or even green. Zik-trin'ak of other colors also have other features associated with their base species.</p>
  <p>While intelligent and capable of speaking, they seldom talk, and cannot be distracted from en assigned task.</p>
  <p class="f"><b>Combat:</b> The zik-trin'ak are mentally adjusted for combat. They are programmed for specific purposes end implacably follow the instructions of the zik-chil who create them. If ordered to guard, they guard; if ordered to attack mammals, they attack mammals; if ordered to attack everything they see, they attack everything they see. They give no quarter end retreat only if ordered to do so.</p>
  <p>Roughly half of zik-trin'ak are psionic. Most are equivalent to 9th-level psychokineticists, with psychometabolism as a secondary discipline.</p>
  <p>If not ordered otherwise, zik-trin'ak first attack from a distance, throwing kyorkcha (inflict 1d8+2, and a +6 damage bonus due to the creature's greet Strength). A zik-trin'ak carries 2d8 kyorkcha, and throws them to soften opposition before closing. Psionic distance attacks are also used.</p>
  <p>After using distance attacks, zik-trin'ak charge, using their leaps to great effect. A zik-trin'ak can leap 40 feet upward or 90 feet forward; it cannot leap backward. When leaping into combat, zik-trin'ak receive standard charge adjustments. Also, the leap itself counts as an attack; the creature's spikes inflict 2d4 points of damage against opponents of man-size or smaller end 1d6+1 against larger opponents.</p>
  <p>Zik-trin'ak use no melee weapons. Once they close to melee, they attack each round with four sets of blades that have replaced their natural claws, plus a bite with augmented mandibles.</p>
  <p>The bite attack is poisonous. The creature bitten must make a successful saving throw vs. poison. Those failing the saving throw immediately take 20 points of damage (shock to the nervous system) and are paralyzed for 2d6 rounds (kreen are immune).</p>
  <p>Finally, the zik-trin'ak can dodge missiles on a roll of 11 or better on 1d20. Only physical missiles can be dodged, not magical effects, and physical missiles with magical bonuses adjust the dodge roll by their magical bonus.</p>
  <p>Zik-trin'ak are resistant to magical and psionic interrogation.</p>
  <p class="f"><b>Habitat/Society:</b> Zik-trin'ak have no society of their own and live on the edges of tohr-kreen society They can be found wherever they are sent by the zik-chil; they respond to the orders of zik-chil (whom they identitfy) by pheromones) and no one else. They enforce the will of the zik-chil end the policies of the the tohr-kreen empire. They do not refer to themselves as zik-trin, but call themselves tohr-kreen.</p>
  <p>As implied by its name (which translates as &ldquo;near-person, altered for combat&rdquo;), the zik-trin'ak has lost its identity. These creatures are devastating combatants, but at the cost of their personality and beliefs, almost like <a href="zombie.html">zombies</a> in many ways. Much like in in their ferocity, zik-trin'ak are also cold, controlled, and cunning. They cannot breed.</p>
  <p class="f"><b>Ecology:</b> Zik-trin'ak are dangerous hunters. Zik-trin were ordinary kreen before their conversion; the process is believed irreversible.</p>
