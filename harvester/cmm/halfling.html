  <p class="f">Halflings are a hard-working race of peaceful citizens. Their communities are similar to those of humans, although they usually contain many burrow homes in addition to surface cottages.</p>
  <p>Halflings average 3 feet in height, have ruddy complexions, with sandy to dark brown hair, and blue or hazel eyes. Their dress is often colorful but serviceable, and they like to wear caps or tunics. In addition to their own language, many halflings also speak the common tongue, <a href="gnome.html">gnome</a>, <a href="goblin.html">goblin</a>, and <a href="orc.html">orcish</a>.</p>
  <p class="f"><b>Combat:</b> Halflings will fight with great ferocity in defense of good or their homes. They are very skilled with both the sling and the bow (receiving a +3 bonus on all attack rolls) and use these weapons to great advantage in battle. Their tactics often involve feints to draw their attackers into the open where they can be subjected to a volley of fire from cover.</p>
  <p>When equipped for battle, halflings wear padded or leather armor. A halfling force is usually armed with short swords and hand axes. In addition, two-thirds of the halflings will be carrying either a sling or short bow.</p>
  <p>All halflings above normal level will have Armor Class 6, while those of 3rd or 4th level wear chain mail over their leather (AC 4). Higher level halflings have a 10 percent chance per level of having a magic weapon or armor.</p>
  <p>As all halflings are naturally resistant to magic and poisons - they save at 4 levels above their actual level. In addition, halflings are exceedingly clever at quiet movement and hiding. In combat, their opponents receive a -5 on their surprise roll. In natural terrain halflings are considered invisible when they are hiding in vegetation.</p>
  <p class="f"><b>Habitat/Society:</b> Halfling villages will generally have between 30 and 300 (30d10) individuals living in them. For every 30 halflings in a particular community there will be two 2nd-level fighters and a 3rd-level priest. If more than 90 halflings are encountered there will be an additional leader of 3rd-level fighting ability. If more than 150 are encountered there will also be the following additional halfling warriors in the group: one 9th-level fighter, two 4th-level fighters and three 3rd-level fighters. Further, a community of 150 halflings will have a 5th-level priest.</p>
  <p>Cheerful and outgoing, halflings, take great pleasure in simple crafts and nature. Their fingers, though short, are very dexterous allowing them to create objects of great beauty. Halflings shun water and extremes in temperature, preferring to settle in temperate pastoral countrysides. They get along well with humans and receive a +2 bonus to all their Reaction Rolls involving human NPCs.</p>
  <p class="f"><b>Ecology:</b> Halflings hunt occasionally, but prefer breads, vegetables and fruits, with an occasional pheasant on the side. They have a life expectancy of 100 years on the average.</p>
  <p class="f"><b>Tallfellow</b></p>  <p class="ni">A taller (4'+) and slimmer halfling with fair skin and hair, tallfellows are somewhat rare among the halfling folk. Tallfellows generally speak the language of elves in addition to those listed previously and greatly enjoy their company. In combat, tallfellows often ride ponies and carry spears or small lances. Tallfellows of strength 17 or more can rise to 6th level fighting ability. They live 180 years on average. Like <a href="elf.html">elves</a>, a tallfellow can recognize a secret door on a roll of 1 on a 1d6. All tallfellows receive a +2 bonus to surprise rolls when in forest or wooded terrain.</p>
  <p></p>
  <p class="f"><b>Stout</b></p>  <p class="ni">These halflings are shorter and stockier than the more common hairfoots. Stouts take great pleasure in gems and fine masonry, often working as jewelers or stone cutters. They rarely mix with humans and elves, but enjoy the company of <a href="dwarf.html">dwarves</a> and often speak their language fluently. Like dwarves, stouts have infravision (60'), a 75% chance to detect sloping passageways, and a 50% chance of determining direction when underground. Stouts with a strength score of 17 or better can work their way up to the 9th-level of fighting ability. Their ties with the dwarven folk have spilled over into their combat tactics, with many stouts employing hammers and morningstars in combat. Stouts also have no fear of water and, in fact, many are excellent swimmers. Stouts can reach an age of 140 or more years.</p>
