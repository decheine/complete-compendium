  <p class="f">In July 1966, an oddly shaped prehistoric worm was described to the scientific community. <i>Tullimonstreum gregarium</i> was only a few inches long (a school of them, possibly young ones, had been buried in a cloud of sediment and preserved that way), but it looked for all the world like a miniature <a href="dinoaqua.html">plesiosaur</a>. It had a small but distinct head (unusual for worms), a slender, swanlike neck, a torpedo- shaped body with a pair of paddlelike flippers up front, and a tail that looks like an ace of spades. In an amazing example of convergent evolution, this worm from the Carboniferous period came to look like a plesiosaur, and undoubtedly lived like one. In his book, <i>The Great Orm of Loch Ness</i>, F. W. Holiday stated his opinion that Nessie and sea serpents in general are giant forms of <i>Tullimonstreum</i>.</p>
  <p>Holiday gives a number of good reasons for his theory. The loch has been checked by sonar a number of times, sometimes showing creatures, sometimes not. If the creatures in the loch were lying, wormlike, on the bottom, the sonar would not distinguish them as separate objects. Also, an aquatic worm would mainly breathe through gills, so it would not have to surface for air, explaining why more sightings are not made. In his second book on this subject, The Dragon and the Disc, he mentions a case from the past where an "orm" came ashore, got itself wedged in a crevice or something, and died. The awed locals reported that it "melted away" without leaving any traces behind. Since worms are soft-bodied, shell-less invertebrates, they would leave no bones or other remains behind once their flesh had rotted away.</p>
  <p>Another bit of evidence is the fact that close views of Nessie instill far more revulsion in people than would seem to be warranted by a good look at a plesiosaur, long-necked seal, etc. One witness actually described the body as "wormy; creepy. The entire body had movement all over it all the time." Echoing these sentiments was a woman who actually took two photographs of a similar beast in a different loch. She said she would not like to see the animal again because she did not like the way it moved when it swam. The two photos showed a head that merged imperceptibly into the neck (no eyes or other features were visible), and a body that changed shape as it swam. Another witness said the "obscene" thing reminded him of a giant stomach with a long, writhing gut attached. Charming! In an early sighting after the Loch Ness fracas began, a Mr. and Mrs. Spicer saw the thing flop across a road and plunge into the loch. They said that more than anything else, it looked like a <a href="sluggian.html">giant slug</a>. There are many descriptions of these lake monsters leaving trails of slime behind them when they come out on land. Whatever game system you use, don't be surprised if your NPC hirelings, colleagues, or whatever take to their heels at the first sight of the thing.</p>
