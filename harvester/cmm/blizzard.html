  <p class="f">Blizzard is the noblest of the seven ancient gods of &ldquo;Urth&rdquo;. He personifies the essence of the animal spirit. After being frozen for millenia at the heart of an immense glacier, he was released when the Urth met the Great Meteor.</p>
  <p>His dwelling is known simply as &ldquo;the Cliff&rdquo; - a snowy plateau with a magnificent mountain nearby.</p>
  <p class="f"><b>Combat:</b> In combat, Blizzard uses his large and powerful hands to pound his opponents into submission, followed by a vicious bite attack. As Blizzard's right arm is more powerful than his left, it can inflict more damage.</p>
  <p>His breath weapon is a powerful cone-shaped blast of ice-air which he can emit up to 20 times per day. He must wait a round between these freezing blasts. The area is a cone 60' long and 30' wide. It causes 20d10 hp damage (a successful save vs. breath causes half damage). Those who survive have a +2 initiative penalty in the next round as they try to shake off the freezing effects.</p>
  <p>Blizzard can also call forth an <i>ice strike</i> (duplicating the 5th-level priest's <i>spellflame strike</i>, but the damage is caused by extreme cold) up to six times per day. Initiative penalties as described with the breath weapon also apply.</p>
  <p>He is immune to all cold and electrical damage, and only takes half damage from acid- and poison-based attacks.</p>
  <p class="f"><b>Habitat/Society:</b> Blizzard's social tendency is a solitary one. He is an enigmatic, legend-like figure, whose worshipful human followers include Tundra tribesmen, warriors, nomads, and - as the embodiment of the animal spirit-rangers, druids, and certain specialty priests and beast lords.</p>
  <p>His roars are often heard high in the mountain ranges during terrible thunder storms. For this reason, many tribesfolk refer to him as &ldquo;Thunder Lord&rdquo;.</p>
  <p>At periodic intervals, usually on the evening of a new moon, the tribesmen leave offerings for him on a huge altar constructed deep within the labyrinthine glacial caves that constitute his lair.</p>
