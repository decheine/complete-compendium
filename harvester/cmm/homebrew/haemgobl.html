  <p class="f">Arguably, the highest level of undeath a human may obtain is the <a href="vampire.html">vampire</a>. Its ability to blend in with human or demihuman society is as much an asset to it as its great strength and magic. However, many humanoid races are not suitable for vampiric conversion. Some sages claim that their willpower or life force is relatively low. Other claim it is the gods that control the spirits of these humanoids that do not allow them to become vampires. It could be that vampires find these humanoids distasteful. However, some humanoids have become undead. Undead gnolls (shoovusa) and trolls (spectral and spirit trolls) have been recorded. The Hæmogoblin is also such a creature.</p>
  <p>Hæmogoblins are created by vampires in need of specialized servants. Creating a hæmogoblin is similar to creating any other type of vampire; blood is exchanged between the vampire and the victim. However, to create the hæmogoblin the vampire needs to use a somewhat different technique. The vampire uses any humanoid creature, such as <a href="orc.html\>orcs</a>, <a href="kobold.html\>kobolds</a>, <a href="goblin.html">goblins</a>, <a href="hobgobli.html">hobgoblins</a>, or <a href="hobgnork.html">norkers</a>. Usually goblins are chosen, due to their size and manageability. Creatures as large as <a href="ogre.html">ogres</a> might be used, but none have ever been reported. Also, <a href="goblyn.html">goblyns</a> cannot be used; they have already been subjected to powerful sorcery.</p>
  <p>First, the vampire master takes the humanoid victim and drains it of most of its blood. The vampire then regurgitates the victim's blood back into its mouth. The victim swallows the blood, and its transformation to undeath has begun. Usually by the next night the victim reawakens to full hæmogoblin status. From this point, the hæmogoblin acts as a servant, somewhere between a homunculus/familiar and a vampiric slave. The vampire lord can create a number of these creatures equal to one-fourth of its own hit dice (for example, a 12 Hit Die vampire can create three (12 HD/4) of these creatures.</p>
  <p class="f"><b>Combat:</b> Hæmogoblins attack with a claw/claw/bite routine. On any natural 20 rolled for the bite attack, the hæmogoblin will begin to drain the victim's blood at the rate of 1 Con point per round. The hæmogoblin can only be removed with a successful Bend Bars/Lift Gates roll. The victim may not attack during the rounds an attempt to remove the hæmogoblin takes place. If the hæmogoblins are size Small or smaller then two may drain one victim at the same time. If the victim reaches 0 Con points then it dies. Unless a <i>bless</i> or <i>remove curse</i> spell is cast on the corpse, it will rise the next night as a <a href="ghoul.html">ghast</a>.</p>
  <p>Hæmogoblins are turned as Ghasts. Hæmogoblins cannot pass on their curse of undeath like the vampire to create other hæmogoblins. However, there is a 50% chance that any humanoid killed by a hæmogoblin will become a <a href="ghoul.html">ghoul</a>, with 5% of those becoming ghasts. These victims are free-willed, but they are at a disadvantage when encountering the vampire that created the hæmogoblin. They make their saves at a -5 penalty and are 25% more likely to fall under that vampire's control.</p>
  <p>Like all undead, hæmogoblins are affected by holy water, taking 2-8 points of damage per vial. Hæmogoblins also take 10 points of damage for every round they are exposed to bright, full sunlight. A <i>continual light</i> spell will cause 1d4 points of damage. They are unaffected by any mind-affecting spells (<i>charm</i>, <i>hold</i>, <i>ESP</i>) or by <i>sleep</i>. Hæmogoblins have infravision to 90'.</p>
  <p class="f"><b>Habitat/Society:</b> Hæmogoblins are created undead; none will occur &ldquo;naturally&rdquo; .They can be most often found in or near the lairs of vampires. Crypts are a very common place to find hæmogoblins. They have been known to associate with ghouls for increased protection and hunting. Hæmogoblins prefer to eat living humans and humanoids. Often, however, they are forced to eat the scraps left to them by their vampire masters. If hard-pressed, hæmogoblins will eat corpses.</p>
  <p>Most hæmogoblins encountered will be in the service of a vampire lord. They are often used as spies for the vampire. In one recorded incident, a vampire set up one of his own hæmogoblins as a scapegoat to cover his own tracks. While an angry mob was dealing with the hæmogoblin, the vampire left the area.</p>
  <p>Unlike with a true familiar, when a hæmogoblin is destroyed the vampire suffers no ill effects.</p>
  <p class="f"><b>Ecology:</b> Hæmogoblins are undead and produce nothing. While the corpses of hæmogoblins may be useful to necromancers or sages, they produce nothing else of value</p>
