  <p class="f">The crystalline shard is one of many minor <a href="quaelege.html">quasi-elementals</a> on the plane of Mineral. This sentient mineral life form is of low intelligence and is rarely encountered on the Prime Material plane. Shards are, however, occasionally summoned in order to serve as guards for some treasure, almost always gems as they will guard these without hesitation.</p>
  <p>In the Mineral plane, these highly mobile crystals can be found skirting the area that lies between the realm of Mineral and the Positive Material plane. Here they absorb the power that gives them life, making forays through the Mineral plane and sometimes traveling to the depths of the elemental plane of Earth. Shards always move about in swarms, the most common group consisting of 2d10 individuals of various sizes (90% chance). Rarely (9% chance), the shards travel in larger swarms, numbering 100 individuals. There are reports of huge groupings with over 1,000 shards, but such groups are very rare (1% chance).</p>
  <p class="f"><b>Combat:</b> Composed entirely of crystal, the shard possesses an extremely hard surface that can be harmed only by weapons of +2 or better enchantment. Any nonmagical weapon that strikes a shard has a 25% chance of shattering. Magical weapons are entitled to a saving throw vs. crushing blow in order to avoid this effect.</p>
  <p>The attack method employed by the shard consists of a slashing assault with its razor-sharp edges. These edges are the equivalent of +2 weapons and inflict 2d4+2 hp damage, plus 1 hp damage per hit die (+5 to +10).</p>
  <p>Once per day, a shard can employ an unusual ability by spinning rapidly in place, emitting a paralyzing burst of multicolored light (as per the wizard spell, <i>color spray</i>) that covers an area with a 30' radius. Anyone caught within the area of effect must save vs. spells or stand bedazzled for 2d4 rounds, even if attacked; paralyzed victims are much easier to strike ( +4 on the attackers' to-hit roll).</p>
  <p>A shard swarm will very rarely be sent to the Prime Material plane on a special mission, usually to seek out any adventurers that may have taken large numbers of gems from the quasi-plane of Mineral.</p>
  <p>There are also reported sightings of shards over 15' long, weighing several tons, but these rumors have not been substantiated.</p>
