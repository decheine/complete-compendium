  <p class="f">Animal <a href="ghost.html">ghosts</a> are the spirits of woodland creatures that died under some unusual circumstance. In the case of pets, they may have been killed while attempting to serve their masters. For wild beasts, it may be that they died while in a panic or other emotionally charged state. Whatever the cause of their unlife, they are doomed to roam the place of their death, haunting those who killed them of seeking to complete an unfinished task. They instinctively hate all life and have an undying hunger that can only be satisfied by drawing the essence from those still living.</p>
  <p>Ghost animals retain the basic forms they had while living, but may show gaping wounds, look emaciated, glow with an eerie luminescence, or appear faint and transparent.</p>
  <p>They still bark, growl, hiss, or make whatever other sounds they did in life, although these now have a haunting, spectral quality to them.</p>
  <p class="f"><b>Combat:</b> Like other ghosts, these undead animals are incorporeal. Though usually encountered only by those in a like state, the residue of their being is visible to non-ethereal creatures and is so frightening that those viewing it must immediately make a fear check. Succumbing to this fear causes the victim to temporarily lose one point of Strength, in addition to the other effects of the failed check. Priests of 5th level or paladins of 8th level are immune to this effect and all other characters of at least 7th level receive a +2 bonus to their fear checks.</p>
  <p>Those who do not retreat promptly upon encountering the ghost are likely to be attacked by it. After spending one round to assume a semicorporeal form, the animal attacks as it would have while alive. In this state, however, its claws, fangs, or other natural weapons will not harm the living. The ethereal touch of such an animal causes those hit by it to age 5-20 (5d4) years.</p>
  <p>While semicorporeal, a ghost animal has an Armor Class of 0 and can be struck only by silver or magical weapons. Spells cast upon the creature will affect it normally. Semicorporeal ghost animals can be turned by priests as if they were spectres and may be harmed by holy water, which does 2d4 points of damage per vial.</p>
  <p>When in its ethereal state, the ghost animal can only be combated by another in the Ethereal plane. If this is the case, it has an Armor Class of 8. They can be attacked by spells, but only if the caster is also ethereal.Any living thing killed by a ghost animal is drained of its life essence and is dead beyond the power of normal magic to revive. No force other than a <i>wish</i> can breathe life into someone slain in this manner.</p>
  <p class="f"><b>Habitat/Society:</b> In most cases, ghost animals are confined to a small area. Usually, this is place where they died, though they may haunt their former lair, or that of the person that killed them. Occasionally, the ghost animal's range extends to the territory the creature once roamed or claimed.</p>
  <p>Most animal ghosts have specific reasons for their hauntings. They are prone to seek revenge on those who ended their lives or were cruel to them. They are very dangerous, as they often do not distinguish between the specific person who slew them and an innocent traveler passing through the area.</p>
  <p class="f"><b>Ecology:</b> The fear that animal ghosts engender has nothing to do with their appearance or the fact that they are dead. The fear they cause and their ability to age a victim through touch are manifestations of their supernatural power. Bravery is not enough to protect someone from their powers.</p>
  <p>Any treasure found with a ghost animal is usually that of former victims, for the creature has no interest in such things itself.</p>
