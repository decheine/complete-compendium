  <p class="f">Dragon fish are very large <a href="eel.html">eel</a>-like creatures that sport a massive array of teeth and exhibit a cunning intelligence. In the case of the saber-toothed, the teeth are so overwhelming that the animal cannot close its mouth. They were named by fishermen who noted their resemblance to the <a href="dragori.html">Oriental dragons</a>. While dragon fish are not actually kin to dragons, being true fish and not reptiles, they are fearsome predators nonetheless.</p>
  <p>All dragon fish are able to distend their jaws and rearrange internal organs in such a way as to swallow meals as large as the animals themselves. The common and saber-toothed varieties have no formal language, but if a <i>speak with animals</i> spell is used they can be made to comprehend ideas of varying complexity. The electric dragon fish, a more intelligent and therefore more dangerous adversary, travels in family groups that communicate by a combination of clicking noises and by varying their discharge or electric current.</p>
  <p class="f"><b>Combat:</b> Dragon fish, often referred to as devil fish by <a href="triton.html">tritons</a>, are constantly on the prowl for a meal. They track prey at a distance, up to one-half mile, by smell and sensing their movement in water. At shorter ranges, they home in on the prey's electrical aura. Because of the acuity of their senses, dragon fish get a +2 bonus on surprise rolls.</p>
  <p>The common and electric varieties of dragon fish stealthily approach a victim before attacking. After engaging in combat, both types are known to "play" with their food before devouring it, much as a cat plays with a mouse. The common dragon fish attempts to bite and maim its prey, then apparently let it go, only later to follow the trail of blood and finish the job. When it is actually ready to consume its victim, it attempts to swallow it whole, which it does on a successful attack roll of 18 or better. The electric variety enjoys stunning its victims with repeated electric jolts. A dragon fish emits a jolt of electricity in a 30' radius around itself. Creatures within 10' of the dragon fish take 3-24 hp damage; those 11'-20' away take 2-12 hp; and those 20'-30' away take 1-8 hp. If a saving throw vs. breath weapon is made, only half damage is taken. Additionally, creatures struck by a dragon fish's electrical attack must make a saving throw vs. paralyzation or be stunned for 1d4 rounds, losing all Dexterity bonuses for armor class and making all attacks and saving throws at -2. Electric dragon fish can discharge three jolts per day and are themselves immune to electric attacks.</p>
  <p>Saber-toothed dragon fish, being somewhat less intelligent than their brethren, rarely employ stealth in their attacks. They also fall short of the wanton viciousness of their counterparts, being motivated more exclusively by hunger. Although larger than the common dragon fish, the sabertoothed variety lacks the ability to swallow prey whole because of its protruding teeth. Rather, it uses its scissorlike fangs to shred its victims, then suck down the remains.</p>
  <p class="f"><b>Habitat/Society:</b> Dragon fish generally make their lairs in the holds of sunken ships or in caverns near the ocean floor. All types have a special fondness for metals, perhaps because metals conduct electricity well, and they collect large hoards. Refined metals, such as coins and armor, are preferred to raw ore or nodules.</p>
  <p>Mating takes place once every third year, with the young being born live 6-8 weeks after conception. Male common and saber-toothed dragon fish leave the female shortly after mating is concluded, but the male of the electric variety stays with the female to form family groups. In all species, the young rarely leave the nest until they have achieved full size, after about one year.</p>
  <p class="f"><b>Ecology:</b> Dragon fish range for hundreds of miles in search of food. They have been known to attack deep-dwelling octopus communities, and the later consider them a grave threat.</p>
