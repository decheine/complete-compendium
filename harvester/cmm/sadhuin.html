  <p class="f">These &ldquo;<a href="satyr.html">satyrs</a>&rdquo; of the Shadow Rift are quite unlike their jolly cousins. They resemble some sort of fiendish parody of a satyr and act appropriately, sporting snarling faces with long beards, four horns and hairy goat legs. The 'flutes' they wear are used to blow small poisonous darts at their victims. The sadhuin (or &ldquo;schattenziege&rdquo;) may also take the form of huge rams, sometimes using this form to attack people who wander near the cliffs of the Rift.</p>
  <p class="f"><b>Combat:</b> Sadhuin are brutal, sneaky and ruthless. Because they lost their magical <i>charm</i> abilities long ago, they now try to disable their opponents with darts they blow through their flutes. All darts are soaked with a very potent poison with effects equal to the <i>sleep</i> spell. Once they have drugged all their victims, they will come out of hiding and try to kill or enslave their prey. Ages ago the sadhuin could only be harmed by weapons made of glass, but at some point in their history they earned the wrath of the <a href="vilay.html">vilay</a>, who cursed them to be vulnerable to wooden weapons as well. Because of their dark natures sadhuin seem to suffer even worse than other fey if exposed to the rays of the sun. Direct sunlight inflicts 5 points of damage to them each turn (or 1 point every other round); filtered light reduces this damage to 3 points per turn.</p>
  <p class="f"><b>Habitat/Society:</b> The sadhuin live in deep caves and in the darkest parts of the Shadow Rift's forests. Sadhuin lairs may be recognized by their disgusting stench. Paradoxically they decorate their homes with the most expensive treasures that fall into their claws. Others even present themselves as artists, drawing crude pictures on the walls. The blood they use as their paint only adds to the foul odor of the lair. Places inhabited by more than one sadhuin are subject to nightly parties. These feasts consists mostly of wild dances, drinking, and cruel games with captured slaves.</p>
  <p class="f"><b>Sadhuinkin</b></p>  <p class="ni">The sadhuin select the worst dregs of humanity for their changelings. Sadhuinkin are drunkards, despoilers, and killers, the scum of humanity. Luckily even they are not safe from the sadhuin's cruel games, keeping their numbers low. These vile changelings are best avoided or destroyed.</p>
