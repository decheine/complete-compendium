  <p class="f">Perhaps the most dangerous and feared inhabitant of the border area that lies between the <a href="quaelege.html">quasi-plane of Mineral</a> and the Positive Material plane is the spined shard. This malign creature is at home both deep into the pure positive energy that it absorbs and within the realm of Mineral - the spined shards hunting ground.</p>
  <p class="f"><b>Combat:</b> The spined shard is a highlyintelligent and extremely cunning opponent.The surface of the creature is veryhard; only weapons of +2 or better enchantmentcan damage a spined shard,and any lesser weapons that make contactwill automatically melt (weapons of +1enchantment have a 50% chance of beinglikewise affected).</p>
  <p>In a 10' radius, the spined shard constantly generates a field of intense magical interference that acts as a limited antimagic shell. This field has a 75% chance of distorting and ruining any spell cast into the area.</p>
  <p>During combat, the spined shard uses its four small tentacles for attack purposes. Each whiplike appendage can inflict 1d4 hp damage. If two or more of these attacks successfully strike a single opponent, the victim is automatically grasped and pulled within range of the two doublewhip stingers. These stingers can attack a grappled opponent, having a +4 to hit such victims and inflicting 2d6 hp of energy damage.</p>
  <p>The most feared attacks used by the spined shard are the four energy bursts that it can hurl each day. These rays are emitted from the four radial spines, each traveling in a tight beam that is only one inch in diameter. This powerful force can strike one victim for 8d8 hp damage (save vs. spells to avoid the beam and all damage). Each energy beam had a range of 75'. In addition, the victim of this attack retains half of the energy that struck him for a duration of one turn. During this time, any living being that approaches within 5' will cause the residual energy to arc, striking this new victim for 4d8 hp damage (save vs. paralysis for half damage). Victims of the secondary pulse do not retain a charge that causes further arcing.</p>
  <p>This predator is vindictive and will kill for no reason. They will wantonly attack entire swarms of shards, feeding on their stored energies. Creatures that approach within 90' risk instant attack by these beings. When sorely injured, spined shards attempt to grab opponents and <i>plane shift</i> deep into the Positive Material plane on the following round.</p>
  <p>High-level wizards will occasionally summon spined shards to serve as a guardians for particularly powerful magical items. Extreme care should be taken, however, for without the proper protection the wizard will be instantly attacked.</p>
