  <div style="border:thin solid #4169e1; margin:1em 1.5em 0; padding:.5em;"><p>Ibrandul, whom the PCs have probably never heard of, is the <q>God of the Dry Depths</q>, (called <q>The Skulking God</q> by non-worshippers) a god of caverns and dungeons and the Underdark. Worshippers in Calimshan and other areas of The Shining South claim that Ibrandul watches over humans who must venture into hostile underground areas, aiding and guiding those who serve him, when when they are in need.</p><p>This small, chiefly Chaotic Neutral sect is expanding, its power steadily growing since the Time of Troubles. Thalandar, the high priest of Ibrandul, is famous in Tashluta for his impassioned <q>Who will lead you in the darkness?</q> sermons. He is trying to establish Ibrandul's worship as a powerful and respected faith in Waterdeep, located as it is over a vast and famous dungeon of underground rooms and powers. PCs will begin to hear his proselytizing message, second-or third-hand, in the taverns of the City: <i>Ibrandul guides you in the dark ways, drives away some dwellers in the darkness who would do you harm, and from time to time reveals great treasures to those who venture into the depths.</i></p><p>Unknown to all the worshippers, Ibrandul was killed by the hand of Shar. She always jealously guarded her portfolio of darkness and her worshippers, and when Ibrandul was weakened tremednously during the Time of Troubles, Shar killed him for daring to subvert followers of the dark away from her worship. After the gods ascended to the heavens, Shar acquired the power and portfolio of Ibrandul.</p><p>She keeps watch over the sect of Ibrandul and grants the clerics their spells. She is pleased with their work and uses her power to help the ibrandlin breed true. She is currently influencing Thalandar to spread the word of Ibrandul to Waterdeep, appearing to him in dreams. Shar's guise as Ibrandul is quite useful to her, allowing her to subvert the worship of her hated enemy Selune without drawing attention to her most faithful worshippers, the nightbringers. Waterdeep is one of the seats of Selune's power, and Shar/Ibrandul enjoys the delicious irony of secretly eroding the power of the Lady of Silver. Whether they call her Shar, Sharess, or Ibrandul, she values her worshippers of the night. The ibrandlin are her gift, guardians of the night's faithful.</p></div>
