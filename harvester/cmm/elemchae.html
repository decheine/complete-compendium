  <p class="f">The <a href="elementa.html">elementals</a> of chaos are intelligent creatures native to one of the four elemental planes. Each of these elementals pursues its own interests vigorously with little, if any, care for order on either its home plane or the Prime Material Plane.</p>
  <p>All elementals of chaos are immune to poison, normal weapons, and 1st- and 2nd-level spells. They also can cast <i>detect invisibility</i> at will. Elementals of chaos cast spells at the 9th level of ability.</p>
  <h2>Eolian</h2>
  <p class="f">Native to the Elemental Plane of Air, eolians appear as shifting wind-beings that look like heat shimmers, although they are actually cool and solid. The creatures, generally 10 feet long and not more than 5 feet wide, can shift their exact dimensions at whim.</p>
  <p class="f"><b>Combat:</b> An eolian plunges enthusiastically into battle, seeing it as the ultimate form of chaos. It normally attacks by buffeting its foe with its windy body. The creature can make assaults like this twice per round, causing 2d4 points of damage with each hit. Instead, if the eolian chooses, it can plunge part of its wavering body into the mouth and lungs of a foe. Doing so requires a successful attack against Armor Class 0. The victim then must make a saving throw vs. death magic or begin to suffocate, automatically suffering 1d8 points of damage per round. An eolian cannot attack while suffocating a foe, but enough of its body remains outside its victim that it can be attacked.</p>
  <p>Eolians can cast each of the following spells three times per day: detect magic, dispel magic, and cloud kill. In addition, the creature can cast control winds and control temperature, 40-foot radius (only to reduce the temperature) each once per day. An eolian is immune to all air-based attacks, but remains vulnerable to earth-based assaults, which cause it double damage.</p>
  <p class="f"><b>Habitat/Society:</b> The vain eolians consider themselves chaos personified. They reflect the nature of their alignment so well that they even change it at least once a day, from chaotic good to chaotic neutral to chaotic evil. The homes of these creatures are vast, swirling maelstroms that catch up their belongings, constantly tossing them aloft.</p>
  <p class="f"><b>Ecology:</b> Eolians count <a href="elemlaae.html">anemos</a> and <a href="elemlaae.html">krysts</a> as enemies, as well as the highly regimented <a href="horde.html">horde</a>. They occasionally help adventurers, when the mood strikes them, although they later get the urge to betray or even harm their &ldquo;friends&rdquo;.</p>
  <h2>Erdeen</h2>
  <p class="f">Erdeens - lumpy rock beings about 9 feet tall - have long veins of metal and ore running throughout their bodies. They originate from the Elemental Plane of Earth.</p>
  <p class="f"><b>Combat:</b> In battle, an erdeen moves with surprising grace. It attacks either by slamming its victim with its fists (1d12/1d12 points of damage) or by casting spells.</p>
  <p>The elemental can cast each of the following spells three times per day: detect magic, dispel magic, and earthquake. In addition, an erdeen can cast transmute rock to mud at will. The creatures are immune to all earth-based attacks, yet vulnerable to air-based attacks, which inflict on them an additional 3 points of damage per die.</p>
  <p class="f"><b>Habitat/Society:</b> Characters rarely encounter the solitar erdeens outside their home plane. When in Mystara, the creatures spend much of their energy rearranging earth and rock into bizarre and unstable configurations. The homes of these elementals constantly shift, topple, and become vacant, as the erdeens move on to new sites. Fascinated by the chaotic instability of earth, these elementals feel amazed that so many creatures view it as a stable element.</p>
  <p>Erdeens have been known to trap adventurers underground and engage them in bizarre discussions about the nature of reality. Those who please the quixotic elementals may go free, though what will ï¿½please an erdeen can be difficult to decide.</p>
  <p class="f"><b>Ecology:</b> The body of an erdeen yields 1d5&times;1,000 gold pieces worth of precious ores and metals. These creatures consider the stodgy <a href="galeduhr.html">galeb duhr</a> and <a href="elemlafw.html">hydrax</a> enemies, hate hordes, and fear air-based creatures and air-based attacks in general.</p>
