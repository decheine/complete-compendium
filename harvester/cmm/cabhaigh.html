  <p class="f">The cabhaigh (ca-VAY) looks like a cross between a huge <a href="frog.html">frog</a> and a <a href="drgnfly.html">dragonfly</a>. Its body is bulbous and its stick-like legs end in claws. Protruding from its back are two sets of gossamer wings. The creature can change its vivid colors, though none of these hues seems quite natural.</p>
  <p>The creature prefers to fly and is capable of carrying up to 300 pounds. Walking is a slow and awkward process on its stick-thin legs.Usually it flies from place to place, perching like a <a href="bird.html">bird</a> on branches and rooftops, where it csn get a good view of what is below. The creature is reported to speak human tongues, <a href="elf.html">elvish</a>, and elvish dialects. A wizard in the company of the cabhaigh can communicate telepathically with it.</p>
  <p>Twice a day the cabhaigh can call upon a special <i>polymorph</i> ability that lets it turn into a dragonfly 3-4 inches long for 8 hours. In this form, it retains all of its abilities and hit points. Once a day it can <i>polymorph another</i> individual or creature into a dragonfly, a form lasting 1d4 turns. A saving throw vs. spell negates the effect. In addition, it can cast two 1st-, 2nd-, and 3rd-level spells per day, at the 8th level of ability.</p>
  <p class="f"><b>Combat:</b> The cabhaigh is a fierce fighter. Its keening weapon fires a harsh, high-pitched sound, radiating outward in a cine 2 feet across at the creature's mouth, 15 feet long, and 15 feet wide at the end. All those caught in the cone suffer 1d8 points of damage. Furtherm they must make a saving throw vs. paralysis or be rooted to the spot for 1d6 rounds. The cabhaigh can use its keening weapon three times a day. The cabhaigh's bite inflicts only 1d4 points of damage; it prefers to use ths as a last resort, staying out of close combat.</p>
  <p>It is impossible to strike the cabhaigh withour at least a +3 weapon</p>
  <p class="f"><b>Habitat/Society:</b> This <a href="garradal.html">garradalaigh</a> is said to dwell on temperate mountains apart form civilization and most other forms of life. When it does seek the companionship of a wizard, it does so rarely and briefly - usually only when an odd loneliness overcomes it. It has also been known to seek the company of other garradalaighs. Tales most often place this creature in eastern Khinasi.</p>
  <p class="f"><b>Ecology:</b> The cabhaigh has few predators; most of these are evil humans, <a href="goblin.html">goblins</a>, and <a href="ogre.html">ogres</a>.</p>
  <p>It subsists on very little - potions when it can find them, spell components, and blades of grass that have been washed by recent rains. It is said never to kill for food.</p>
