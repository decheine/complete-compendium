  <p class="f">Messengers of the very gods themselves, translators are humanoid beings that travel the planes at tremendous speeds, relaying messages of real importance. These speedy couriers of the powers look like spheres of shining silver around three feet in diameter. They pulse with an inner, yellow hue when they are carrying a message. They have no apparent &ldquo;front&rdquo; or &ldquo;back&rdquo;, and exhibit no corporeal form whatsoever.</p>
  <p>All translators can speak any language they find necessary. It will take approximately 30 seconds for one to pick up a new language. Note that the translator's does not have to hear the language spoken - when in the presence of creatures who speak a language unknown to the translator, it will pick up that language magically.</p>
  <p class="f"><b>Combat:</b> There are two occasions and two occasions only when a translator will fight: when they are being directly prevented from delivering a message and when they cannot outrun an attacker. With their impressive speed and great maneuverability, translators are very likely to be able to outrun anything attacking them, and will do so to avoid combat when they are not delivering a message.</p>
  <p>If forced into combat, translators attack with a shining silver beam of light. Translators have the ability to almost always hit in combat, missing only on a roll of 1. The translator need simply choose its target and a it will hit. The silver beam of energy has a powerful stun effect. Anyone struck by the beam will be automatically stunned for 1d12-3 rounds. No save is possible. If the result is zero or less, the beam did not carry sufficient power to stun its target. Anyone stunned by a translator will be unable to move or think for the duration of the effect. The target will, in effect, be in a total state of suspended animation. It also carries the devastating effect of wiping spell casters' minds clean of memorized spells.</p>
  <p>The gods of the upper planes take very special care of the translators. These beings literally carry the plans and will of the gods from plane to plane. Therefore, if a translator is attacked while delivering a message, the sending deity will always become aware of this and send aid. In such an instance, roll d100. If the result is 99 or less, the deity will send one of his <a href="aasimon.html">aasimon</a> servants to help. If the result is 00, roll again. If the second roll is 99 or less, the deity sends 1d6+1 aasimon servants. If the result is 00, the deity himself will appear. Aid of this type will arrive in 1d10 rounds after the translator is attacked.</p>
  <p class="f"><b>Habitat/Society:</b> Translators are the prized messengers of the gods. They are quiet and unassuming creatures, but carry great importance with them.</p>
  <p>Translators do not have a society. They are content in their absolute servitude to the gods. They are not rewarded in any way. A translator's entire existence consists of either delivering a message or waiting patiently for a message to deliver.</p>
  <p>These couriers are completely incapable of altering a message. They will always relay it with perfect accuracy, maintaining not only the words but also the spirit of the message's intent.</p>
  <p class="f"><b>Ecology:</b> Translators derive their sustenance from the energy of the gods. They do not eat, drink, or sleep. If not for the fact that they are sentient and intelligent, translators might easily be mistaken for mere automatons. As intelligent beings, translators can evaluate situations and conduct themselves in the best manner for the completion of their message-bearing missions.</p>
