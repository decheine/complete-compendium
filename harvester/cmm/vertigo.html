  <p class="f">Vertigo is a wicked cobrasaur sorceress from another dimension who was released from banishment when the Great Meteor collided with the Urth. She functions as an 18th-level mage specializing in alteration magic. She dwells in a place of insanity located in multiple dimensions and accessed through a conduit located at an ancient stone circle.</p>
  <p class="f"><b>Combat:</b> In combat, Vertigo attacks with two claws, a deadly poison-laden bite, and a powerful tail slash. If she scores a successful bite, the opponent must save vs. poison (type E). A successful save results in 20 hp damage; a failed save means instant, painful death.</p>
  <p>In addition to her mage spell powers, she also has a number of deadly spell-like powers accessable at will. They are a <a href="scorpion.html">scorpion</a> sting, gaze, and acid spittle.</p>
  <p>For the scorpion sting, she can transform her tail into an adamantine spike with which to strike opponents. The tail hits for 3-30 hp damage. A Dexterity check allows an opponent to dive out of the way, but prevents him from being able to have initiative in the following round.</p>
  <p>Her gaze can either <i>hypnotize</i> or <i>petrify</i>. For hypnosis, the range is 50', and she can affect up to 10 individuals, who must save vs. spells at -4. The petrification has a range of 20' and can affect up to three individuals whose save vs. petrification is at -3.</p>
  <p>Up to 10 times per day, Vertigo can spit a globule of poisonous green acid up to 100' affecting an area with a radius of 20'. This acid causes 15d10 hp damage. A successful save vs. breath weapon will reduce the damage by half.</p>
  <p>Vertigo can also <i>teleport</i> at will, with no error.</p>
  <p>She is completely immune to acid, poison, and magical fire. Normal fire and lightning do only half damage.</p>
  <p></p>
  <p class="f"><b>Habitat/Society:</b> Vertigo's worshippers consist of sorcerors and witches. When the Great Meteor hit the planet and the continents were re-arranged, some ancient stone circles still remained, and it is near one of these ancient magical vorteces that Vertigo founded her Urthly temple.</p>
  <p>The evil cobrasaur sorceress then opened a planar conduit within the circle connecting her directly to her extradimensional "Temple of Insanity."</p>
