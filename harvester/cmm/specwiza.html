  <p class="f">Spectral wizards are undead that retain their abilities to cast spells. They are created by a unique speell that functions on human and <a href="elf.html">elf</a> wizards and <a href="gnom.html">gnome</a> illusionists, taking hold only on those whose bodies once channeled wizard magic.</p>
  <p>Spectral wizard appear as they did in life, though most of the color has been drained from them. They appear in what they wore at the time of death, and it is as insubstantial as their bodies. They are incorporeal and nearly invisible in bright light. In darkness they cast an unearthly glow.</p>
  <p class="f"><b>Combat:</b> Spectral wizards exist partially on the Ethereal Plane, so they can be affected only by spells, silver or enchanted weapons, or by ethereal combatants. If challenged on the Ethereal Plane, a spectral wizard is AC 8.</p>
  <p>A spectral wizard attacks with its paralyzing touch. A successful hit causes one of its opponent's limbs (roll 1d4: 1 = right arm, 2 = left arm, 3 = right leg. 4 = left leg; reroll any repeats) to become numb and useless for 2d4 rounds. Coming within 10 feet of a spectral wizard causes portions of opponents' bodies to tingle as if they had &ldquo;fallen asleep&rdquo; and results in a -1 penalty to attack rolls.</p>
  <p>With effort, a spectral wizard can become solid, allowing it to use weapons and material spell components. Solidification takes one round in darkness or 2d4 rounds in bright light (such as daylight or a <i>continual light spell</i>). In both incorporeal and solid forms, the wizard is AC 0.</p>
  <p>When spectral wizards are created, they are permanently drained of 1d4 levels and will forever cast spells at this new level. Spectral wizards who operate at level 5 and above are considered high level when rewarding experience points.</p>
  <p>Material components carried on the spectral wizard's person become insubstantial and resolidify when it does.</p>
  <p>Spectral wizards are immune to <i>sleep</i>, <i>charm</i>, <i>hold</i>, <i>cold</i>, <i>fear</i>, <i>polymorph</i>, <i>paralyzation</i>, and <i>death</i> magic. They are turned as spectres.</p>
  <p class="f"><b>Habitat/Society:</b> Spectral wizards can be encountered anywhere. They often make lairs in their former homes or in a place where other wizards live. All continue to memorize spells from their books and scrolls, and many become involved in research into new spells or magical items. Spectral wizards have difficulty studying because of their immaterial state.</p>
  <p>Though spectral wizards can be of any neutral alignment, the majority are neutral evil and only a few (5%) are neutral good. Their insubstantial nature seems to cause a mental imbalance which turns them to a neutral evil alignment.</p>
  <p class="f"><b>Ecology:</b> Spectral wizards are created artificially and have no ecological niche.</p>
