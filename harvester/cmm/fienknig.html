  <p class="f">The Fiend Knights of Doom are an elite squad of warriors created from normal men by spellcraft on the part of both Ivid V himself, and Xaene, and also using mind-controlling magics crafted from <a href="baatezu.html">baatezu</a> relics. These servants are utterly, mindlessly loyal to the overking.</p>
  <p class="f"><b>Combat:</b> Fiend knights have the same number of hit dice as they had levels when mortal fighters. For example, a 5th-level fighter would become a 5-HD fiend knight. Nearly all fiend knights are 10th level or below, with three exceptions - leaders of 11, 12, and 15 HD. These three leaders, and some dozen others, wear <i>fiend plate mail +3</i>. Others are 5% per level likely to wear magical plate mail (roll 1d10: 1-8 plate mail +1, 9 plate mail +2, 10 plate mail +3), else nonmagical plate mail. Fiend knights always employ two-handed weapons, usually two-handed swords, and composite long bows. Again, they are 5% per level likely to have magical weapons (use the table above, independently for each weapon type). Leaders are always armed with magical weapons, and the 11 + HD leaders all possess powerful ones: a <i>two-handed sword of cold +3</i> and a <i>two-handed sword +3, giant slayer</i>.</p>
  <p>The fiend knights have high ability scores. All possess Strengths of 18/01 or better, and have minimum Dexterity and Constitution scores of 15. No ability ever has a score below 9.</p>
  <p class="f"><b>Habitat/Society:</b> The current composition of the fiend knights, in addition to their leaders, is approximately 80 cavalry, 20 of whom ride undead steeds, the other 60 riding normal <a href="horse.html">heavy warhorses</a>. Treat the undead steeds as heavy warhorses with immunity to <i>sleep</i>, <i>charm</i> and <i>hold</i> spells. These troops have heavy lances, again with a 5% chance per level for a magical lance, and they employ footman's flails in addition to two-handed weapons.</p>
  <p>The 120 heavy infantry each carry a long spear and a variety of polearms in addition to other weaponry. They have a 2% chance per level for a magical polearm.</p>
  <p>As currently organized, the fiend knights wear gold visors and bear a heraldic emblem etched on their armor over the heart. For cavalry, the emblem is a tan horse, and for infantry, it is a bronze baboon. The infantry are known as &ldquo;The Howlers&rdquo;, for when they go into combat they howl and scream, hoping to strike fear into the hearts of their enemies.</p>
  <p class="f"><b>Ecology:</b> Fiend knights are not undead, and have none of their weaknesses: they cannot be turned, harmed by holy water, and so on. They are simply wholly controlled humans loyal to Ivid, created by a precursor of the malign rituals that brought the <a href="animus.html">animus</a> to Oerth. The unfeeling, &ldquo;programmed&rdquo; nature of the fiend knights make them feared by all. Even Ivid's other troops hate and fear them, and loathe having to serve with them.</p>
