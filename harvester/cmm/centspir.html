  <p class="f">The spirit <a href="centiped.html">centipede</a> is a poisonous shapeshifter that frequently administers punishments on behalf of the Celestial Bureaucracy. The creature resembles an enormous centipede about 4 feet long, complete with a segmented body, multiple legs, and two long feelers. However, it has a human face with a bald head, bushy moustache, and nine eyes evenly distributed about its head. The chitinous shell covering the length of its body alternates segments of green, scarlet, and silver.</p>
  <p>The spirit centipede can utter simple phrases in trade language, as well as in languages common to the area it inhabits.</p>
  <p class="f"><b>Combat:</b> The greater spirit centipede can freely shapeshift between five forms, each representing one of the Five Venoms originally identified by the great Wa scholar Hujiiko Jiriki (centipede, <a href="scorpion.html">scorpion</a>, <a href="snake.html">snake</a>, <a href="spider.html">spider</a>, and <a href="toadgian.html">toad</a>). Shapeshifting requires one full round, during which the centipede can take no other actions.</p>
  <p>All five forms are about the same color and size. The creature also retains its Armor Class, hit points, and other attributes. Each form can bite or sting to inflict 1-4 hit points of damage. Additionally, each can cough up a black fog cloud with a 15' diameter.</p>
  <p>As detailed below, movement rates and black cloud attacks vary between forms. Though the centipede can shapeshift an unlimited of times per day, it only can use a given fog cloud attack three times per day. Victims must contact the cloud to suffer its effects. (The creature itself is immune.) All effects are cumulative.</p>
  <p><b>Centipede.</b> Movement rate: 18. Fog cloud: Victims must save vs. paralyzation or become immobile for the next 2-8 (2d4) rounds.</p>
  <p><b>Scorpion.</b> Movement rate: 12. Fog cloud: Victims must save vs. spells. Failure means their vision is blurred for the next 2-8 (2d4) rounds. During that time, they suffer a -4 penalty to all to-hit rolls.</p>
  <p><b>Snake.</b> Movement rate: 15. Fog cloud: Victims suffer 1-10 hit points of poison damage. A successful saving throw vs. poison cuts this damage in half.</p>
  <p><b>Spider.</b> Movement rate: 18. Fog cloud: Victims are affected as if by a <i>pain</i> spell (Dexterity and Strength are reduced to 3, -3 penalty on to hit rolls, -1 on damage rolls, -3 on reaction attacking adjustment, +4 on reaction defensive adjustment) for the next 2-8 (2d4) rounds. A successful saving throw vs. spells negates this effect.</p>
  <p><b>Toad.</b> Movement rate: 9. Fog cloud: Victims immediately fall into a deathlike coma for 1-6 turns. A successful saving throw vs. death magic negates this effect.</p>
  <p class="f"><b>Habitat/Society:</b> Spirit centipedes have no permanent lairs. They roam from place to place in search of food, or travel as directed by the Celestial Bureaucracy to punish heretics or the unworthy.</p>
  <p class="f"><b>Ecology:</b> All spirit centipedes can eat most inorganic objects, but they have a special taste for minerals. When freely given, and kept in an earthenware jar inside a building, a scale from a greater spirit centipede has the same properties as a <i>charm of protection from disease</i>.</p>
  <p class="f"><b>Lesser Spirit Centipede</b></p>
  <p class="ni">The lesser spirit centipede is a smaller version of the greater spirit centipede, with a few changes. Its chitinous shell is entirely black. Its shapeshifting is limited to three forms, which move more slowly than noted above: centipede (MV 12), snake (MV 9), and toad (MV 6). Its fog clouds work the same, except the region of effect is reduced to a 10-foot diameter. Regardless of its current form, if a lesser spirit centipede crawls over the body of an ailing person, it mimics a <i>cure disease</i> spell.</p>
  <p class="f"><b>Least Spirit Centipede</b></p>
  <p class="ni">The least spirit centipede is a small version of the lesser spirit centipede, with a few changes. Its chitinous shell is entirely white. It can shapeshift only between two forms with these movement rates: centipede (MV 6) and toad (MV 3). Its fog clouds work the same, except the diameter of the cloud is reduced to 5 feet. A spirit centipede may give us its reincarnation as a favor or to repay a debt of honor. When it dies under these conditions, the creature's body turns to brass. The brass body works as a <i>charm of protection from spirits</i> when hung inside a building.</p>
