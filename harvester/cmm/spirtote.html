  <p class="f">Each type of animal has a spirit that stands as an archetype for the species. So long as the species exists (or at least, so long as sentient mortals are aware of it), the totem spirit continues to exist, presenting mortals with an anthropomorphic (humanlike) image of the species. It is usually encountered in areas where its animal type is abundant or being exploited and abused</p>
  <p>Each totem spirit may appear either as a stunningly beautiful version of the animal it represents, or as a hu-manoid with the animal's features (a shapely woman with the head of a cat, for example). Its movement rate is the same in either form.</p>
  <p class="f"><b>Combat:</b> Totem spirits prefer to avoid combat, and will instead try to use trickery to reach their goals. However, if
    confronted with flagrant abuse of the animals they represent, they can bring to bear the deadly natural weaponry of their
    animal type, or can attack as a loth-level fighter who is specialized in whatever weapon they choose to wield.</p>
  <p class="f"><b>Accepted Alignments:</b> True neutral or neutral good.</p>
  <p class="f"><b>Familiarity:</b> Totem spirits expect shamans to have demonstrated an ability to live in harmony with the wilderness and the animals of the land, and then to make a sacrifice of 200 gp to it.</p>
  <p class="f"><b>Demands:</b> Totem spirits demand that shamans oppose any attempt to exploit or destroy their patron animal. The shaman must also spend one day each week attending a shrine to the totem spirit if such exists in their vicinity.</p>
  <p>The animal totem also expect mortals in general to respect the wildernessâ€“to kill only what they need (hunting to sell the meat or skins is not approved of), to take deadfall in preference to living wood, and so on. Those who fail to do so have frequent accidents and invariably fail to bag any animals on hunts.</p>
  <p class="f"><b>Benefits:</b> Any solitary shaman spell and priest spells of the animal sphere up to 5th level, plus <i>animal spy</i>, <i>call pack</i>, and <i>create sanctuary</i>. Additionally, any hunter giving 10% of his or her catch to a totem spirit as a sacrifice receives a -2 bonus to all proficiency checks concerning that species of animal, including Hunting, Set Snares, Tracking, and Animal Handling, so long as the hunter doesn't use these powers to exploit the land</p>
