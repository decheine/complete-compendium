  <p class="f">Loup-garous are powerful cousins of the common <a href="lycawewo.html">werewolf</a>. Like most true werewolves in Ravenloft, they can assume three forms: human, man-wolf, and <a href="wolf.html">wolf</a>. The human form is completely normal.</p>
  <p>The loup-garou always looks the same in its human form. just as it looks the same in its wolf or man-wolf form. In this shape, the beast has a movement rate of 12.</p>
  <p>As a man-wolf, it stands about 7' tall and is extremely muscular. The body is fur-covered and has a short tail, canine legs, and a wolf's head. The creature walks erect and can manipulate things with its hands. In this form, the creature can talk, although its voice is low and raspy. The man-wolf shape is also faster than its human guise, having a movement rate of 15.</p>
  <p>As a wolf, a lowland loup-garou looks just like a <a href="wolf.html">worg wolf</a> while its mountain cousins are larger. The creature is swiftest in this form, having a movement rate of 18, but cannot handle tools or weapons, and cannot talk.</p>
  <p class="f"><b>Combat:</b> The tactics and weapons that a loup-garou employs in combat depends wholly upon the shape that it employs. The creature needs a full round to change from one form to another.</p>
  <p>The human can belong to any character class and may have any experience level, although most loup-garous tend to be warriors or thieves. The experience level never affects Hit Dice or hit points. Werewolves without a character class are treated as 1st level fighters. In this form, the creature depends upon weapons to defend itself.</p>
  <p>In man-wolf form, the loup-garou can attack 3 times per round, once with each clawed hand and with a bite. It can use a weapon, but then only gets one attack per round. The creature has a Strength of 18/00 in this form, and gains the appropriate combat bonuses (+3 on attacks and +6 to damage).</p>
  <p>In wolf form, a loup-garou can attack only once each round by biting. This form has the advantage of speed and surprise, however. Because of its keen senses, a loup-garou in wolf form imposes a -2 penalty on its enemies' surprise rolls. The wolf form is also less conspicuous than the man-wolf, appearing as a normal animal rather than a supernatural creature.</p>
  <p>In any form, the lowland loup-garou has some natural resistance to magic. Its mental capacity remains the same regardless of shape.</p>
  <p>The creature can be harmed only by silver or magical weapons. Silver weapons do normal damage, but magical weapons only do as much damage as their bonus. For example, a <i>sword +1</i> can inflict no more than 1 point of damage per successful hit, regardless of the damage roll. A character's Strength bonus does not apply. A blessed weapon (of other specialty weapon with a bonus) inflicts 1 point of damage per hit.</p>
  <p class="f"><b>Habitat/Society:</b> Lowland packs wander the Ravenloft domains in search of prey, preferably humans. In the wild, lowland packs often use a cave or ruined building as a den. They also have been known to travel as humans and stay in inns. They hate other lycanthropes and especially <a href="wolfwere.html">wolfweres</a>.</p>
  <p class="f"><b>Ecology:</b> The werewolf's most fearsome aspect is the infection its bite can cause. Any infected human or humanoid can become a werewolf when the condition is triggered (frequently by the 3 days of a full moon). The infected werewolf can be controlled by the true werewolf that infected him. In animal form, the infected creature is a semi-intelligent (2-4), raging beast. It takes a full turn for an infected werewolf to change from man to wolf or vice versa.</p>
  <p class="f"><b>Mountain Loup-garou</b></p>  <p class="ni">This larger species is as big as a <a href="wolf.html">dire wolf</a> when in wolf form. It can only be hurt by gold or magical weapons. It is more magic resistant than many types of werewolves, and can regenerate 1 hit point per turn. Mountain loup-garous are more likely to hunt alone than other forms of werewolf.</p>
