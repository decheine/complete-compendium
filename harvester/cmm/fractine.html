  <p class="f">Fractines appear as two-dimensional, mirrored, trapezoidal planes. When at rest, fractines resemble vast mirrors and can be manipulated to function as excellent scrying mirrors. To do so, a spelljamming scholar must focus his willpower on the subject he wishes to view, while touching a fractine. A Wisdom check (modified by a DM-selected difficulty penalty of -1 to -10) must succeed to view the subject. Failure results in 1d10 turns of exhaustion and a 10% chance that the fractine is stirred into motion, One can examine a subject's past, future, and weaknesses using the right techniques. However, the fractine's distorted surface may blur the results, obscuring crucial information.</p>
  <p>Fractines are most commonly encountered in space in an active state, tumbling or folding and refolding like a piece of origami. They react to a variety of stimuli. They are attracted to motion, loud sounds, and magical energy. However, large bursts of energy (such as a <i>fireball</i> or <i>lightning bolt</i>) repulse fractines for 1d4 rounds. Spells affecting air can be used to control fractines. (The caster must roll a successful saving throw vs. spell each round or lose control.)</p>
  <p class="f"><b>Combat:</b> A fractine causes a variety of harmful, distortional efects. Physical attacks may be used to destroy or alter its course, but only silver or magical weapons or spells cause any damage. Furthermore, a fractine must be struck on one of its two faces to cause any damage.</p>
  <p>Any physical damage to a fractine causes damage to the attacker. The attacker suffers 1d4&times;25% of the inflicted damage (round fractions up), though he receives a saving throw vs. petrification to suffer only half damage.</p>
  <p>Once per round there is a 1% chance per point of damage inflicted that a fractine shatters into 1d4 independent fragments, each with one-third of the remaining HD and hp (shattering releases any held creatures).</p>
  <p>A fractine receives a saving throw vs. any magical effect, if the effect gets past its magic resistance. If the saving throw is successful, the magical effect is redirected at random.</p>
  <p>A fractine attacks by falling on its targets. The fractine passes through its victims, causing 2d4 points of damage and forcing a saving throw vs. breath weapon to avoid a special effect. If the saving throw fails, roll 1d20 for the effect.</p>

   <tr><td>13</td><td>Transpose* (Part of body is exchanged with that of another victim, or it vanishes. Roll an Intelligence check to control body part.)</td></tr>

  <p class="f"><b>Habitat/Society:</b> It is not known whether fractines are intelligent creatures or merely spatial phenomena. Shattered fragments either follow divergent paths or merge once again.</p>
  <p class="f"><b>Ecology:</b> Fractines consume life, light, darkness, and magical energy. Each level, Hit Dice, spell level, and bonus provides 1 point of food. When a fractine has consumed a number of points equal to its total hit points, it leaves. Its movement rate is increased by 1 per point of light consumed and decreased by 1 per point of darkness (maximum of 24 and minimum of 1).</p>
