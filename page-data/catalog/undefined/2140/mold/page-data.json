These fungi usually have a woolly or furry texture. While most molds are harmless, there are (<a href=\"/appendix/mold2\">at least</a>) three varieties of monstrous molds that pose a deadly threat to adventurers: brown, russet, and yellow mold.</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Brown Mold</b></p>  <p class=\"ni\">Brown mold is found in damp subterranean areas, such as caverns and caves. It is light to golden brown in color. Brown mold feeds by absorbing heat, even body heat; where brown mold grows, the temperature is below average. Direct sunlight or ultraviolet light kills it.</p><p>If a warm-blooded creature comes within 5 feet of a brown mold, the mold drains heat equal to 4d8 points of damage from its victim, per round. A <i>ring of warmth</i> provides complete protection against this attack. Brown mold grows instantly from heat. If a torch is used in its vicinity, it doubles in size; if flaming oil is used, it quadruples, and fireball-type spells cause it to grow eight-fold.</p><p>Brown mold is not fed by cold light sources (e.g., <i>light</i>, <i>faerie fire</i>). The only magic that affects it are <i>disintegrate</i> (which destroys it), plant-affecting magic, and cold spells. Ice storms or walls of ice cause it to go dormant for 5d6 turns. A <i>cold wand</i>, <a href=\"/appendix/dragcwhi\">white dragon</a> breath, or a <i>cone of cold</i> kills it. Brown mold does not affect cold-using creatures such as white dragons, <a href=\"/appendix/wolf\">winter wolves</a>, <a href=\"/appendix/toadgian\">ice toads</a>, etc.</p><p></p><p class=\"f\"><b>Russet Mold</b></p>  <p class=\"ni\">Russet mold is golden-brown to rust red in color. It has a lumpy texture similar to cold porridge; it is covered by short, hair-like growths that stand upright and wave as if they were in a cold breeze. It resembles rust at distances beyond 30 feet (70% chance of error). It is immune to weapons and most spells; it is affected only by alcohol, acid, and salt, which kill it; a <i>cure disease</i> or a <i>continual light</i> spell also destroys it.</p><p>Russet mold continuously emits a cloud of spores in a three-foot radius. All creatures in this cloud suffer 5d4 points of damage (per round in the cloud) and must roll a successful saving throw vs. poison or become infected with spore sickness. Victims of spore sickness are instantly paralyzed and die in 5d4 minutes unless a <i>cure disease</i> spell is cast on them.</p><p>Anyone who dies from spore sickness undergoes a transformation and begins to sprout russet mold growths; when completely covered in mold (1d4+20 hours), he becomes a <a href=\"/appendix/moldman\">mold man</a>. A <i>hold plant</i> spell will halt the growth of the mold for the duration of the spell, while a <i>cure disease</i> spell destroys it within an hour after death; after that, a <i>wish</i> is necessary to destroy it.</p><p></p><p class=\"f\"><b>Yellow Mold</b></p>  <p class=\"f\"><b>Psionics Summary</b></p><table class=\"ip\"><tr class=\"bk\"><th>Level</th><th>Dis/Sci/Dev</th><th>Attack/Defense</th><th>Score</th><th>PSPs</th></tr><tr class=\"cn\"><td>1</td><td>2/0/2</td><td>II/Nil</td><td>15</td><td>1d1&times;05 (special)</td></tr></table><p class=\"ni\"><b>Telepathy -</b> <i>Sciences:</i> nil; <i>Devotions:</i> mind wipe, id insinuation.</p><p class=\"ni\"><b>Metapsionics -</b> <i>Sciences:</i> nil; <i>Devotion:</i> psionic sense.</p><p class=\"ni\">Psionic sense: 1d100+20' range, no cost.<br>Only sentient yellow molds (1 in 6 chance) have psionic powers. Such creatures are also immune to psionic attacks unless the creature is being aided by one who can communicate with plants.<br></p><br>  <p class=\"ni\">This mold is pale yellow to golden orange in color. If touched roughly, it may (50% chance) emit a cloud of spores in a 10-foot radius. Any creature caught in this cloud must roll a successful saving throw vs. poison or die. A <i>cure disease</i> spell and a <i>resurrection</i> spell within 24 hours are necessary to restore life.</p><p>Fire of any sort destroys yellow mold. A <i>continual light</i> spell renders it dormant for 2d6 turns.</p><p>Yellow mold colonies of over 300 square feet are sometimes sentient (1 in 6 chance). These molds sense creatures within 60 feet, and may project their spores that distance. Twice per day, they may use a <i>suggestion</i> on someone within that radius; in addition to the saving throw, the victim must successfully roll an Intelligence check or lose 1 point of Intelligence permanently (it is devoured by the mold).</p><p></p><br clear=\"all\" style=\"clear:both; height:0;\">\r\n","images":["<img src=\"grf/xx.gif\" width=\"150\" height=\"75\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Advanced Dungeons & Dragons 2nd Edition\" title=\"Advanced Dungeons & Dragons 2nd Edition\" align=\"right\">","<img src=\"img/mold.gif\" alt=\"Mold I\" title=\"Mold I\" border=\"0\" width=\"300\" height=\"360\" style=\"text-align:right;\" align=\"right\">","<img src=\"grf/tsr_sm.png\" width=\"56\" height=\"59\" border=\"0\" alt=\"TSR\">"],"setting":"Advanced Dungeons & Dragons 2nd Edition","statblock":{"Brown":{"Activity Cycle":"Any","Alignment":"Neutral","Armor Class":"9","Climate/Terrain":"Subterranean","Damage/Attack":"N/A","Diet":"Heat","Frequency":"Very rare","Hit Dice":"N/A","Intelligence":"Non- (0)","Magic Resistance":"Nil","Morale":"N/A","Movement":"0","No. Appearing":"1 patch","No. of Attacks":"0","Organization":"Patch","Size":"S-L","Special Attacks":"Freezing","Special Defenses":"Absorb Heat","THAC0":"N/A","Treasure":"Nil","XP Value":"15"},"Russet":{"Activity Cycle":"Any","Alignment":"Neutral","Armor Class":"9","Climate/Terrain":"Subterranean","Damage/Attack":"N/A","Diet":"Moisture","Frequency":"Very rare","Hit Dice":"N/A","Intelligence":"Non- (0)","Magic Resistance":"Nil","Morale":"N/A","Movement":"0","No. Appearing":"1 patch","No. of Attacks":"0","Organization":"Patch","Size":"S-L","Special Attacks":"Spores","Special Defenses":"Immune to weapons, cold, fire","THAC0":"N/A","Treasure":"Nil","XP Value":"35"},"Yellow":{"Activity Cycle":"Any","Alignment":"Neutral","Armor Class":"9","Climate/Terrain":"Subterranean","Damage/Attack":"N/A","Diet":"Mental Energy","Frequency":"Uncommon","Hit Dice":"N/A","Intelligence":"Not Ratable (0)","Magic Resistance":"20%","Morale":"N/A","Movement":"0","No. Appearing":"1 patch","No. of Attacks":"1","Organization":"Patch","Size":"S-L","Special Attacks":"Poison Spores","Special Defenses":"Affected only by fire","THAC0":"N/A","Treasure":"Nil","XP Value":"65"}},"title":"Mold I"},"sources":["2140"],"statblock_names":[],"title":"Mold I","prev_key":"mistvamp","next_key":"moldman","catelog_book":"2140"}},"staticQueryHashes":[],"slicesMap":{}}
