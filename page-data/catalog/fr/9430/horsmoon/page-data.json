The last herds of moon-horses on Faerï¿½n were transported to the isle during the retreat, and most continue to run free through Evermeet's forests and meadows, serving the <a href=\"/appendix/elf\">elves</a> as needed.</p><p>These magnificent animals vary from white to silverygray in color, with manes ranging from white to black. A moon-horse.s eyes are deep and highly intelligent, and its facial expressions reflect a wide variety of moods.</p><p>Moon-horses are similar in temperament to the elves whom they serve. They roam Evermeet freely, but voluntarily serve as cavalry mounts for Evermeet's cavalry.</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Combat:</b> Moon-horses are tough fighters, and far less flighty than ordinary horses. Each moon-horse has the ability to cast one magical spell per day, as determined by rolling 1d10 and referring to the following table.</p><table class=\"ip\"><tr class=\"bk\"><th>Die Roll</th><th>Spell</th></tr><tr><td>1</td><td><i>Color spray</i></td></tr><tr><td>2</td><td><i>Magic Missile</i></td></tr><tr><td>3</td><td><i>Shield</i></td></tr><tr><td>4</td><td><i>Sleep</i></td></tr><tr><td>5</td><td><i>Wall of Fog</i></td></tr><tr><td>6</td><td><i>Knock</i></td></tr><tr><td>7</td><td><i>Ray of Enfeeblement</i></td></tr><tr><td>8</td><td><i>Stinking Cloud</i></td></tr><tr><td>9</td><td><i>Summon Swarm</i></td></tr><tr><td>10</td><td><i>Web</i></td></tr></table><p>Moon-horses are completely immune to all special attacks such as <i>level drain</i> or <i>paralysis</i> by undead, although they still take normal damage.</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Habitat/Society:</b> Moon-horses normally travel in herds of as many as 20 individuals. However, many associate voluntarily with elves, serving as companions and mounts.</p><p>The horses' association with the elves is a very old one. Ancient legends tell of heroes who rode wise and mighty moon-horses into battle, and of moon-horses who saved their masters at the cost of their own lives. The alliance between the two races continues to this day, with moon-horses serving the riders of Queen Amlaruil.</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Ecology:</b> Moon-horses suffer from many of the same fertility problems as elves. Typically, a given moonhorse female has only one or two foals during her entire lifetime. Moon-horses are quite long-lived, with a lifespan of 200 years or more. Because of the rarity of foals among the moon-horses, births are momentous events, celebrated by elves and horses alike.</p><br clear=\"all\" style=\"clear:both; height:0;\">\r\n","images":["<img src=\"grf/fr.gif\" width=\"150\" height=\"75\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Forgotten Realms\" title=\"Forgotten Realms\" align=\"right\">","<img src=\"img/horsmoon.gif\" alt=\"Horse, Moon-\" title=\"Horse, Moon-\" border=\"0\" width=\"300\" height=\"360\" style=\"text-align:right;\" align=\"right\">","<img src=\"grf/add2_01.gif\" width=\"200\" height=\"56\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Advanced Dungeons & Dragons 2nd Edition\">"],"setting":"Forgotten Realms","statblock":{"Horse, Moon-":{"Activity Cycle":"Day","Alignment":"Chaotic Good","Armor Class":"7","Climate/Terrain":"Plains, meadows (Evermeet)","Damage/Attack":"1-8/1-8","Diet":"Herbivore","Frequency":"Rare","Hit Dice":"4","Intelligence":"Average.very (9-12)","Magic Resistance":"Nil","Morale":"Champion (15)","Movement":"18","No. Appearing":"5-20","No. of Attacks":"2","Organization":"Herd","Size":"L","Special Attacks":"Magic","Special Defenses":"Undead immunity","THAC0":"17","Treasure":"Nil","XP Value":"270"}},"title":"Horse, Moon-"},"sources":["2158","9430"],"statblock_names":[],"title":"Horse, Moon-","prev_key":"catgcash","next_key":"kholiath","catelog_book":"9430","catelog_setting":"fr"}},"staticQueryHashes":[],"slicesMap":{}}
