Their goal is to destroy any living creature that they encounter.</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Combat:</b> The desert wraith shifts between its two forms as it sees fit; it uses its jackal form to charge at its prey, then transforms itself into human form to attack. The human form inflicts 1d4 points of damage on a touch and drains the victim of one life level (no saving throw allowed), as per a wraith, with appropriate reductions in hit points, spell abilities, etc.</p><p>A desert wraith is undead and can be turned, on the same column as a spectre. Daylight destroys them utterly, and holy water inflicts 2d4 points of damage per vial.</p><p>While they have only low intelligence, they are capable of cunning (e.g., burying themselves in the sand, then attacking their prey by surprise).</p><p>They can see in total darkness as if it were noon.</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Habitat/Society:</b> A desert wraith is totally evil. It lives only to feed off the life forces of others. Desert wraiths dig barrows for themselves in the sand; they retreat to these during the day.</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Ecology:</b> Desert wraiths feed off life force energy. No creatures exist that prey on them. Creatures brought to 0 life levels by a desert wraith are transformed into <a href=\"/appendix/zombie\">zombies</a> within 48 hours, even if raised, unless their bodies are washed in holy water.</p><br clear=\"all\" style=\"clear:both; height:0;\">\r\n","images":["<img src=\"grf/fr.gif\" width=\"150\" height=\"75\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Forgotten Realms\" title=\"Forgotten Realms\" align=\"right\">","<img src=\"grf/add2_01.gif\" width=\"200\" height=\"56\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Advanced Dungeons & Dragons 2nd Edition\">"],"setting":"Forgotten Realms","statblock":{"Wraith, Desert":{"Activity Cycle":"Night","Alignment":"Chaotic evil","Armor Class":"4","Climate/Terrain":"Subtropical/Desert","Damage/Attack":"1-4 (in human form) or 1-6 (in jackal form)","Diet":"Life energy","Frequency":"Rare","Hit Dice":"6+3","Intelligence":"Low (5-7)","Magic Resistance":"30%","Morale":"Elite (13-14)","Movement":"9 (18 in jackal form)","No. Appearing":"1-3","No. of Attacks":"1","Organization":"Solitary or Group","Size":"M","Special Attacks":"Energy drain","Special Defenses":"+1 or better weapon to hit","THAC0":"13","Treasure":"Nil","XP Value":"2,000"}},"title":"Wraith, Desert"},"sources":["9274"],"statblock_names":[],"title":"Wraith, Desert","prev_key":"skriaxit","next_key":"coloston","catelog_book":"9274","catelog_setting":"fr"}},"staticQueryHashes":[],"slicesMap":{}}
