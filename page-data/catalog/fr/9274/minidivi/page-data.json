Each minion is a fanatical follower of the deity and serves his ends at all costs.</p><p>Divine minions serve as messengers of the deities. In the case of the minions of Set, they also serve as assassins and as military assistance for his mortal worshipers. They appear as great warriors, well over six feet tall and quite broad, in bronze plate armor that is decorated with the symbol of their deity.</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Combat:</b> Divine minions are capable of taking a number of different forms. Armor Class, Hit Dice, and hit points remain the same, while they acquire the movement rate, attacks, and special attacks of each form.
