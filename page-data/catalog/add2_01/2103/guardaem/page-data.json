Guardian daemons always defend their charge with great ferocity</p><p>There are three types of guardian daemons-least, lesser, and greater. The least and lesser guardian daemons vary in size and form. often being homed and frog-like (least) or ape- or boar-like (lesser). Greater guardian daemons always appear as gigantic, winged bears with ram horns protruding from their foreheads, and eagle talons for hands.</p><p>Guardian daemons have the ability to speak all languages.</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Combat:</b> Guardian daemons can breath fire three times per day in a cone 30 feet long with a 10-foot b.ise diameter Damage deÂ· pends upon the type of daemon breathing. Least and lesser daemons cause 3d6 and Sdo points of damage respectively, while greater daemons inflict 7d6 points per breath attack. A successful saving throw vs. breath weapon reduces damage by half. Gu.irdian daemons never use their fire breath if the fire might damage whatever they are assigned to protect.</p><p>All guardian daemons are immune to <i>charm</i>, <i>hold</i>, <i>sleep</i>, <i>polymorph</i>, and <i>fear</i> spells. Lesser and greater daemons are also im pervious to weapons with less than a + 2 bonus. Many of these creatures are invulnerable to one or more additional forms of attack (e.g. sword, cold, fire, electricity).</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Habitat/Society:</b> Guardian daemons must remain at all times within 90 yards of the object they have been summoned to protect. Within this 90-yard radius, guardian daemons prefer to remain at a distance in battle using their breath weapon to maximum advantage.</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Ecology:</b> Summoning a guardian daemon is a dangerous affair. There is a 10% chance for each level the summoner is over 7th level of having his request for a guardian daemon granted (maximum chance of 90% ). Conversely, if the summoning fails, there is a 30% chance (-2% per level of the summoner over 10th) that the daemon takes offense and gates in to slay the spellcaster</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Least Daemon</b></p><p class=\"f\">These creatures are often summoned to protect treasures valued at less than 25,000 gold pieces. Least daemons have a 50% chance of being immune to one additional type of attack.</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Lesser Daemon</b></p><p class=\"f\">Lesser daemons are usually found guarding treasures of 25,000 gold pieces or more. They have a 80% chance of being impervious to one additional attack form.</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Greater Daemon</b></p><p class=\"f\">These daemons are dispatched only to protect obiects of exceedingly great value. Greater guardian daemons are resistant to magic (25%) and are always immune to two additional forms of attack. They can make a <i>suggestion</i>, as the spell, once per round, even when engaged in combat.</p>\n","images":["<img src=\"grf/xx.gif\" width=\"150\" height=\"75\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Advanced Dungeons & Dragons 2nd Edition\" title=\"Advanced Dungeons & Dragons 2nd Edition\" align=\"right\">","<img src=\"img/guardaem.gif\" alt=\"Guardian Daemon\" title=\"Guardian Daemon\" border=\"0\" width=\"300\" height=\"360\" style=\"text-align:right;\" align=\"right\">","<img src=\"grf/tsr_sm.png\" width=\"56\" height=\"59\" border=\"0\" alt=\"TSR\">"],"setting":"Advanced Dungeons & Dragons 2nd Edition","statblock":{"Greater":{"Activity Cycle":"Any","Alignment":"Neutral (evil)","Armor Class":"-1","Climate/Terrain":"Any","Damage/Attack":"1-10/1-12/1-12","Diet":"Nil","Frequency":"Very rare","Hit Dice":"10","Intelligence":"High (13-14)","Magic Resistance":"25%","Morale":"Fanatic (18)","Movement":"9, Fl 9 (D)","No. Appearing":"1","No. of Attacks":"3","Organization":"Solitary","Size":"L (9' tall)","Special Attacks":"See below","Special Defenses":"See below","THAC0":"10","Treasure":"See below","XP Value":"11,000 |"},"Least":{"Activity Cycle":"Any","Alignment":"Neutral","Armor Class":"3","Climate/Terrain":"Any","Damage/Attack":"1-4/1-10/1-10","Diet":"Nil","Frequency":"Rare","Hit Dice":"6","Intelligence":"Average (8-10)","Magic Resistance":"Nil","Morale":"Elite (14)","Movement":"9","No. Appearing":"1","No. of Attacks":"3","Organization":"Solitary","Size":"Variable","Special Attacks":"See ht-low","Special Defenses":"See below","THAC0":"13","Treasure":"See below","XP Value":"2,000"},"Lesser":{"Activity Cycle":"Any","Alignment":"Neutral (evil)","Armor Class":"1","Climate/Terrain":"Any","Damage/Attack":"1-6/1-12/1-12 ","Diet":"Nil","Frequency":"Very rare","Hit Dice":"8","Intelligence":"Very (11-12)","Magic Resistance":"Nil","Morale":"Champion (16) ","Movement":"9","No. Appearing":"1","No. of Attacks":"3","Organization":"Solitary","Size":"Variable","Special Attacks":"See below","Special Defenses":"See below","THAC0":"12","Treasure":"See below","XP Value":"4,000"}},"title":"Guardian Daemon"},"sources":["2103"],"statblock_names":[],"title":"Guardian Daemon","prev_key":"griffon","next_key":"haunt","catelog_book":"2103","catelog_setting":"add2_01","monster_path":"/catalog/add2_01/2103/guardaem"}},"staticQueryHashes":[],"slicesMap":{}}
