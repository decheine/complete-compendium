If this answer catches the imagination of enough people, it will give rise to a new form of spirit.</p><p>This is how the fenettes came to dwell in the waterways of a particular region: One widow claimed that temptresses lived in the river, and that it was they who had lured her husband to a watery death, not drink and darkness as some neighbors claimed.</p><p>The fenettes appear most frequently as slender young women with long hair that clings to their bodies with moisture. They will either use this pleasant form to lure men to the edge of river, or they will use their <i>shapechange</i> ability (making them one of the few spirits with this power) to appear like a gold ring or other valuable item laying near on the bottom near the edge. When the opportunity presents itself, they embrace their victim like a vise (20 Strength) and drag him to a watery doom.</p><p>Although these spirits are often mistaken for nymphs, these malign creatures have nothing in common with that race.</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Combat:</b> Fenettes try to avoid direct confrontations, preferring lone victims that are easily killed. However, if forced to fight, their slender forms belie their massive strength: They are more lethal in hand-to-hand combat than many warriors are with swords, and have reportedly punched straight through a man's chest on occasion. More often, however, a fenette simply <i>shapechanges</i> into a fish and swims away should she be faced with a foe or force that is beyond her ability to deal with. Should all else fail, she can animate the bodies of unrecovered victims. There are 1d6 of these foul corpses at the fenette's disposal. They have the attributes of <a href=\"/appendix/zombsea\">sea zombies</a>. (See the MONSTROUS MANUAL for details.)</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Accepted Alignments:</b> Any. (See below.)</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Familiarity:</b> : It is virtually impossible for any male to approach a fenette and not either become a victim or walk away empty-handed; fenettes see only targets in males, be they shamans or not. Only a woman can safely approach a fenette, and in order to become familiar with one, all the woman has to do is know where to find her.</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Demands:</b> Ironically, the fenettes claim that they drag men into the river because they are lonely. They pine for the company of men, but can never have any. For this reason, they demand that any female shaman receiving spells or benefits from a fenette bring them at least one male per month, and spend one night each week telling the spirit all about her love life. If the shaman is having poor luck on the romance front, the fenette is serious and full of helpful advice, but greets happy romantic developments with the giggly excitement of a young teenage girl.</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Benefits:</b> sponsor 2nd- to 4th-level spells from the solitary shaman spell lists, as well as priest spells from the Elemental Water sphere of up to 4th level. Additionally, they grant favored servants with the ability to cast <i>water breathing</i> once per day.</p>\n","images":["<img src=\"grf/add2_01.gif\" width=\"150\" height=\"75\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Advanced Dungeons & Dragons 2nd Edition\" title=\"Advanced Dungeons & Dragons 2nd Edition\" align=\"right\">","<img src=\"img/fenette.gif\" alt=\"Fenette\" title=\"Fenette\" border=\"0\" width=\"300\" height=\"360\" style=\"text-align:right;\" align=\"right\">","<img src=\"grf/tsr_sm.png\" width=\"56\" height=\"59\" border=\"0\" alt=\"TSR\">"],"setting":"Advanced Dungeons & Dragons 2nd Edition","statblock":{"Fenette":{"Activity Cycle":"Any","Alignment":"Chaotic Evil","Armor Class":"10","Climate/Terrain":"Streams and rivers","Damage/Attack":"1d3+7 punch","Diet":"Male life force","Frequency":"Rare","Hit Dice":"1","Intelligence":"14","Magic Resistance":"Nil","Morale":"Champion (15-16)","Movement":"10","No. Appearing":"1- 4","No. of Attacks":"1","Size":"M","Special Attacks":"Shapechange","Special Defenses":"+1 or better to hit, immunity to <i>charm spirit</i>","THAC0":"20","XP Value":"175"}},"title":"Fenette"},"sources":["9507"],"statblock_names":[],"title":"Fenette","prev_key":"bogeymen","next_key":"ghospack","catelog_book":"9507","catelog_setting":"add2_01","monster_path":"/catalog/add2_01/9507/fenette"}},"staticQueryHashes":[],"slicesMap":{}}
