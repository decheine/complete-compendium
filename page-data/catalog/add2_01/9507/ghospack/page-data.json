They continue to hunt their mortal lands, regardless of the changes to the area. Some cities are prone to infestations of ghostly wolves, while plantations may suffer from ghost lions, and so on. Rare packs have been discovered led by nemeses or rogue heroes.</p><p>The members of ghost packs appear as they did while they lived, though they often appear to be unhealthily thin. Some have red, black, or opaque eyes; others have pure white or black fur.</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Combat:</b> Ghost packs attack as their living counterparts would, but they are not stopped by walls and other trapping of civilization. Ghost packs pass through them as if they were not there. A <i>circle of protection from spirits</i> and <i>create sanctuary</i> are the two ways to stave off these spirits</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Accepted Alignments:</b> Any.</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Familiarity:</b> Characters who wish to become familiar with these spirits must bring them a live specimen of a species they once hunted but can no longer find in the area. The ghost pack will then hunt the animal, and will perform a service for the character. (This is not a formal sacrifice, and does not require a Shamanic Ritual proficiency check.)</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Demands:</b> Shamans must protect the pack from those who would prevent it from hunting. In return the pack can offer few spells, but the spirits will protect the shaman if his life is in grave danger, descending upon those who threaten their ally and tearing them to shreds. Ghost packs have no interest in mortals' worship.</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Benefits:</b> Ghost packs can sponsor up to 2nd-level spells from the priestly Animal sphere, and up to 4th-level spells from the solitary shaman's list</p><img src=\"/img/spc/ghospack1.gif\" alt=\"Ghost Packs\" title=\"Ghost Packs\" border=\"0\" style=\"column-span: all; width: 100%; display: grid; align-self: center; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\"><br clear=\"all\" style=\"clear:both; height:0;\">\r\n","images":["<img src=\"grf/add2_01.gif\" width=\"150\" height=\"75\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Advanced Dungeons & Dragons 2nd Edition\" title=\"Advanced Dungeons & Dragons 2nd Edition\" align=\"right\">","<img src=\"/img/spc/ghospack1.gif\" alt=\"Ghost Packs\" title=\"Ghost Packs\" border=\"0\" style=\"column-span: all; width: 100%; display: grid; align-self: center; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\">","<img src=\"grf/tsr_sm.png\" width=\"56\" height=\"59\" border=\"0\" alt=\"TSR\">"],"setting":"Advanced Dungeons & Dragons 2nd Edition","statblock":{"Ghost Packs":{"Activity Cycle":"Any","Alignment":"Neutral","Armor Class":"5","Climate/Terrain":"Settled Areas","Damage/Attack":"As per animal type","Diet":"Sacrifices","Frequency":"Uncommon","Hit Dice":"1 per member","Intelligence":"2","Magic Resistance":"Nil","Morale":"Champion (15-16)","Movement":"10","No. Appearing":"1 (1-20 pack members)","No. of Attacks":"1","Size":"As per animal type","Special Attacks":"As per animal type","Special Defenses":"+1 or better to hit, see below","THAC0":"As per animal type","XP Value":"As per animal type +2HD"}},"title":"Ghost Packs"},"sources":["9507"],"statblock_names":[],"title":"Ghost Packs","prev_key":"fenette","next_key":"roguhero","catelog_book":"9507","catelog_setting":"add2_01","monster_path":"/catalog/add2_01/9507/ghospack"}},"staticQueryHashes":[],"slicesMap":{}}
