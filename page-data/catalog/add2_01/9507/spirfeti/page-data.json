They are stupid, foolish beings. They appear as misshapen, gob-linoid creatures, but have an air of unreality about them. Colored in shades of gray, they appear to be a child's painting come to life.</p><p>Fetish spirits are obsessed with bringing \"justice\" to the world, and their sole expertise is in vindicating their own malicious actions. Still, they refuse to aid shamans and others in criminal acts or unprovoked evil.</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Combat:</b> Each fetish spirit has a particular power that may be harnessed by binding the creature into a physical object, such as an amulet. The spirit eagerly uses this power as the owner wishes (though only once per day) in order to help the owner right wrongs, gain vengeance, bring wrongdoers to justice.</p><p>The DM should invent appropriate powers for each fetish spirit, but they may also be determined randomly. In that case,  the DM should roll 1d20 and consult the following list: Each fetish power, works as the priest spell of the same name.  1-4 <i>Curse</i>, 5-7 <i>Cause light wounds</i>, 8-9 <i>Detect evil</i>, 10 <i>Detect poison</i>, 11-15 <i>Detect lie</i>, 14-16 <p>Protection from good</p>,  17-18 <i>Cause disease</i>, 19 <i>Cause blindness</i>, 20 <i>Cause deafness</i>.</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Accepted Alignments:</b> Any lawful.</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Familiarity:</b> When unbound, fetish spirits cannot be approached by mortals for aid.</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Demands:</b> None when \"wild,\" other than their obsession with justice. Encounters should adhere to the fetish spirit's sense of justice. When bound into physical objects, fetish spirits require one animal gift per month (a mouse or bird will suffice), the blood to be poured over the fetish object. If this is not forthcoming they refuse to let their owners use their powers until they have had the blood they feel they are owed.</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Benefits:</b> Any person who owns a fetish object (into which such a spirit is bound) may direct its powers for any lawful ends. Fetishes hate dishonesty, betrayal, theft, murder - in fact, they hate anything commonly considered a crime, or that they could argue to be criminal. They love nothing as much as to punish \"criminals\" at their masters' commands. Of course, the sycophantic spirits are largely blind to their masters' own faults, but still they do not allow their powers to be used for any criminal action - unless the act is itself in revenge for a previous crime</p><br clear=\"all\" style=\"clear:both; height:0;\">\r\n","images":["<img src=\"grf/add2_01.gif\" width=\"150\" height=\"75\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Advanced Dungeons & Dragons 2nd Edition\" title=\"Advanced Dungeons & Dragons 2nd Edition\" align=\"right\">","<img src=\"img/spirfeti.gif\" alt=\"Fetish Spirits\" title=\"Fetish Spirits\" border=\"0\" width=\"300\" height=\"360\" style=\"text-align:right;\" align=\"right\">","<img src=\"grf/tsr_sm.png\" width=\"56\" height=\"59\" border=\"0\" alt=\"TSR\">"],"setting":"Advanced Dungeons & Dragons 2nd Edition","statblock":{"Fetish Spirits":{"Activity Cycle":"Any","Alignment":"Lawful Evil","Armor Class":"5","Climate/Terrain":"Any structure or area where crimes are punished and sentences handed down","Damage/Attack":"1d6","Diet":"Sacrifices","Frequency":"Common","Hit Dice":"3","Intelligence":"9","Magic Resistance":"Nil","Morale":"Champion (15-16)","Movement":"10","No. Appearing":"1","No. of Attacks":"1","Size":"S","Special Attacks":"Nil","Special Defenses":"+1 or better to hit","THAC0":"18","XP Value":"50"}},"title":"Fetish Spirits"},"sources":["9507"],"statblock_names":[],"title":"Fetish Spirits","prev_key":"spirbloo","next_key":"spirgrea","catelog_book":"9507","catelog_setting":"add2_01","monster_path":"/catalog/add2_01/9507/spirfeti"}},"staticQueryHashes":[],"slicesMap":{}}
