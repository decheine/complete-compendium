Though normally passive, herd animals can be dangerous when angered or frightened.</p><p>Herd animals are four-legged hoofed mammals covered with hair - thick fur for buffalo, curly wool for sheep, and short, coarse hair for <a href=\"/appendix/camel\">camels</a>, antelope, and cattle. Male cattle, buffalo, antelope, and sheep have sharp horns. A camel's humps (one hum for dromedaries, two for bactrian) enable it to go without food or water for up to two weeks.</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Combat:</b> Most herd animals attack by biting. Buffalo defend themselves with their horns, usually attacking if approached too closely (6' or less); if charging from a distance of at least 40', a buffalo does 3-18 hp of impaling damage plus 1-4 hp of trampling damage. Nasty-tempered camels have a 50% chance of spitting at persons attempting to ride them or use them for pack animals; the victim of a spit attack has a 25% chance of being blinded for 1-3 rounds. Cattle, antelope, and sheep generally flee from danger, but will attack if cornered or threatened. A male antelope or sheep defending his herd will charge, inflicting 1-4 hp of butting damage if charging from at least 40'. Male cattle are 75% likely to attack if intruders approach before the herd has a chance to escape.</p><p>If frightened by intruders, there is a 25% that the entire herd will stampede. If a herd stampedes, roll 2d4 for each creature in the path of the stampede who does not take cover (such as by hiding in a tree or behind a rock pile or wall). This is the number of herd animals trampling the exposed creature.</p><p>Trampling causes either 1-4 hp of damage (camel, cattle, antelope, and sheep) or 1-6 hp of damage (buffalo) per herd animal trampling.</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Habitat/Society:</b> Herd animals graze on open terrain, migrating to a new territory when the food supply of the old has been depleted. Herd size varies from a family of four buffalo to a commercial flock of 1,000 sheep. The largest and oldest male usually serves as the leader, directing the movement his herd and watching for predators. Herd animals do not collect treasure.</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Ecology:</b> Herd animals eat grass, grains, and shrubbery. They are the favored prey of carnivores, including <a href=\"/appendix/catgreat\">lions</a>, <a href=\"/appendix/catgreat\">tigers</a>, and <a href=\"/appendix/dragon\">dragons</a>. Man often domesticates herd animals for their meat, milk, fur (blankets and clothing), and skin (shoes and tents). Dried droppings of herd animals can be burned for fuel.</p>\n","images":["<img src=\"grf/xx.gif\" width=\"150\" height=\"75\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Advanced Dungeons & Dragons 2nd Edition\" title=\"Advanced Dungeons & Dragons 2nd Edition\" align=\"right\">","<img src=\"img/mammherd.gif\" alt=\"Mammal, Herd I\" title=\"Mammal, Herd I\" border=\"0\" width=\"300\" height=\"360\" style=\"text-align:right;\" align=\"right\">","<img src=\"grf/tsr_sm.png\" width=\"56\" height=\"59\" border=\"0\" alt=\"TSR\">"],"setting":"Advanced Dungeons & Dragons 2nd Edition","statblock":{"Antelope":{"Activity Cycle":"Day","Alignment":"Nil","Armor Class":"7","Climate/Terrain":"Tropical and temperate plains","Damage/Attack":"1-4","Diet":"Herbivore","Frequency":"Common","Hit Dice":"2","Intelligence":"Animal (1)","Magic Resistance":"Nil","Morale":"Unreliable (3)","Movement":"24","No. Appearing":"4-24 (4d6)","No. of Attacks":"1","Organization":"Herd","Size":"M (5' tall)","Special Attacks":"Stampede","Special Defenses":"Nil","THAC0":"19","Treasure":"Nil","XP Value":"35"},"Buffalo":{"Activity Cycle":"Day","Alignment":"Nil","Armor Class":"7","Climate/Terrain":"Tropical and temperate plains","Damage/Attack":"1-8/1-8","Diet":"Herbivore","Frequency":"Uncommon","Hit Dice":"5","Intelligence":"Semi- (2-4)","Magic Resistance":"Nil","Morale":"Average (10)","Movement":"15","No. Appearing":"4-24 (4d6)","No. of Attacks":"2","Organization":"Herd","Size":"L (5' at shoulder)","Special Attacks":"Charge","Special Defenses":"Head is AC 3","THAC0":"15","Treasure":"Nil","XP Value":"175"},"Camel":{"Activity Cycle":"Day","Alignment":"Nil","Armor Class":"7","Climate/Terrain":"Any land","Damage/Attack":"1-4","Diet":"Herbivore","Frequency":"Common","Hit Dice":"3","Intelligence":"Animal to semi- (1-4)","Magic Resistance":"Nil","Morale":"Unreliable (3)","Movement":"21","No. Appearing":"1-12","No. of Attacks":"1","Organization":"Herd","Size":"L (80' tall)","Special Attacks":"Spitting","Special Defenses":"Nil","THAC0":"17","Treasure":"Nil","XP Value":"65"},"Cattle":{"Activity Cycle":"Day","Alignment":"Neutral","Armor Class":"7","Climate/Terrain":"Any land","Damage/Attack":"1-4","Diet":"Herbivore","Frequency":"Common","Hit Dice":"1-4","Intelligence":"Semi- (2-4)","Magic Resistance":"Nil","Morale":"Unreliable (4)","Movement":"15","No. Appearing":"20-200","No. of Attacks":"1","Organization":"Herd","Size":"L (8' long)","Special Attacks":"Stampede","Special Defenses":"Nil","THAC0":"17","Treasure":"Nil","XP Value":"15-120"},"Sheep":{"Activity Cycle":"Day","Alignment":"Nil","Armor Class":"7","Climate/Terrain":"Any land","Damage/Attack":"1-4","Diet":"Herbivore","Frequency":"Common","Hit Dice":"2","Intelligence":"Animal (1)","Magic Resistance":"Nil","Morale":"Unreliable (3)","Movement":"12","No. Appearing":"10-100","No. of Attacks":"1","Organization":"Herd","Size":"M (5' long)","Special Attacks":"Charge","Special Defenses":"Nil","THAC0":"19","Treasure":"Nil","XP Value":"35"}},"title":"Mammal, Herd I"},"sources":["2140","2102"],"statblock_names":[],"title":"Mammal, Herd I","prev_key":"lycawewo","next_key":"manticor","catelog_book":"2102","catelog_setting":"add2_01","monster_path":"/catalog/add2_01/2102/mammherd"}},"staticQueryHashes":[],"slicesMap":{}}
