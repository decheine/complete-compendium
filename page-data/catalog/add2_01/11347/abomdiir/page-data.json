It has an oblong body and stony flesh. The creature has three dead, white eyes spaced at equal intervals around its upper body. The eyes have neither lids nor pupils. Three double-jointed arms sprout from the top of the body. Each arm bears a taloned hand. Three smaller arms jut from the mid-body, one below each eye; each ends in a drooling mouth. </p><p>Swirling patterns of light and dark ripple along the Abomination's skin. A close look reveals these patterns to be the images of dwarven faces writhing in torment. </p><p class=\"f\"><b>Combat:</b> </p><p>The Abomination can move through earth (dirt, sand, mud, stone, or metal) freely. When moving through earth, it can sense opponents through vibrations they create. It can detect a motionless opponent's heartbeat and breathing. The creature's favorite tactic is to rise up from below like a fish striking an insect. The maneuver imposes a -5 penalty to opponents' surprise rolls.</p><p>The Abomination attacks with its six limbs; it can attack six different targets, but usually concentrates on only one or two. The creature's mouths inflict only 1d3 points of damage, but once they strike a target they remain attached. An attached mouth automatically inflicts bite damage and drains one level of life energy per round (the same as a wight) until the Abomination releases its hold or the opponent breaks free. A mouth can be wrenched loose by making an attack vs. Armor Class 5 (to grab the offending appendage) and a Bend Bars roll with a +20% bonus (rolls of 96+ fail). The victim suffers 2d6 points of damage when the mouth tears loose. A slashing weapon can sever an arm with a called shot (4 attack penalty and-1 initiative penalty) that inflicts at least 10 points of damage in a single blow. A blow directed at an arm has no effect if it inflicts less than 10 points of damage. Severing the arm leaves the mouth attached to the victim, still inflicting damage and draining energy.</p><p>A creature completely drained of life energy becomes a dry husk and is forever dead. If the Abomination drains all the life energy from a <a href=\"/appendix/dwarf\">dwarf</a>, the victim's tortured visage appears on the creature's body.</p><p>The Abomination's claws inflict 2d4+4 points of damage. If two or three claws strike the same opponent, they rend and cause an additional 4d4+4 points of damage.</p><p>The Abomination regenerates 3 hit points each round Severed limbs continue fighting (move 6) until the Abomination is slain.</p><p>The creature can be slain only in its home dimension. If reduced to less than 0 hit pomts elsewhere, the creature fades away and returns home, where it must ret for 2d6 hours before venturing forth again. To permanently lay the creature it must be reduced to -20 hit point on its home plane, and its remains must be doused with holy water and powder from the amulet that controls it.</p><p>If the Abomination's Magic Resistance roll fails, spells are still turned a though the creature were wearing a <i>ring of spell turning</i>.</p><p>The Abomination is immune to normal heat, cold. electricity, acid, and poison. Magical forms of these attacks (and breath weapons) inflict half damage if the creature fails its saving throw and no damage if its saving throw succeeds.</p><p>Only weapons of +3 or better enchantment harm the Abomination. Edged weapons (types P and S) inflict damage equal only to their enchantment bonus plus the wielder's Strenglh bonus.</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Habitat/Society:</b> The <a href=\"/appendix/dwarderr\">derro</a> power Diirinka created the Abomination aeons ago in answer to a plea from Brassbeard Moradinson, a dwarf whose desire to own the <i>Axe of the Dwarvish Lords</i> drove him to betrayal and murder. Brassbeard was given a talisman to control the creature, but (according to Diirinka's plan) it failed, freeing the Abomination to run amok.</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Ecology:</b> The Abomination has a taste for minerals, which suggests that it might have once been a om corrupted by Diirinka's magic. Its favorite food is life force, particulady dwarven life force.</p><br clear=\"all\" style=\"clear:both; height:0;\">\r\n","images":["<img src=\"grf/add2_01.gif\" width=\"150\" height=\"75\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Advanced Dungeons & Dragons 2nd Edition\" title=\"Advanced Dungeons & Dragons 2nd Edition\" align=\"right\">","<img src=\"img/abomdiir.gif\" alt=\"The Abomination of Diirinka\" title=\"The Abomination of Diirinka\" border=\"0\" width=\"300\" height=\"360\" style=\"text-align:right;\" align=\"right\">","<img src=\"grf/tsr_sm.png\" width=\"56\" height=\"59\" border=\"0\" alt=\"TSR\">"],"setting":"Advanced Dungeons & Dragons 2nd Edition","statblock":{"The Abomination of Diirinka":{"Activity Cycle":"Any","Alignment":"Chaotic Evil","Armor Class":"-3","Climate/Terrain":"Subterranean","Damage/Attack":"2d4+4/2d4+4/2d4+4/ 1d3/ 1d3/ 1d3","Diet":"Life energy, minerals","Frequency":"Unique","Hit Dice":"20 (140 hit points)","Intelligence":"Not Ratable","Magic Resistance":"30%","Morale":"Fearless (19-20)","Movement":"9, Br 9","No. Appearing":"1","No. of Attacks":"6","Organization":"Solitary","Size":"H (12' tall)","Special Attacks":"Rend, energy drain, surprise","Special Defenses":"Immmunities, regeneration, spell turning","THAC0":"1","Treasure":"Nil","XP Value":"22,000"}},"title":"The Abomination of Diirinka"},"sources":["11347"],"statblock_names":[],"title":"The Abomination of Diirinka","prev_key":"tombward","next_key":"dwarcrus","catelog_book":"11347","catelog_setting":"add2_01","monster_path":"/catalog/add2_01/11347/abomdiir"}},"staticQueryHashes":[],"slicesMap":{}}
