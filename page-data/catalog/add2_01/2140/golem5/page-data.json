It has the bleached-white skeleton of a <a href=\"/appendix/snake\">giant snake</a>, a fanged human skull, and constantly whirling, milk-white eyes. Its bones are warm to the touch. The necrophidius is odorless and absolutely silent; the skeleton makes no noise, even when slithering across a floor strewn with leaves. A necrophidius is constantly moving with a macabre grace.</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Combat:</b> The necrophidius prefers to surprise opponents, and its silence imposes a -2 penalty to their surprise rolls. If the necrophidius is not surprised, it performs a macabre maneuver called the <i>Dance of Death</i>, a hypnotic swaying backed by minor magic. The Dance rivets the attention of anyone who observes it, unless a successful saving throw vs. spell is rolled. Intelligent victims are immobilized, as per the <i>hypnotism</i> spell. This allows the necrophidius to attack without opposition.</p><p>Besides taking damage as indicated, a bitten victim must make a saving throw vs. spell or be paralyzed and unconscious for 1d4 turns. This effect can be cancelled only by <i>dispel magic</i>; <i>neutralize poison</i> is useless.</p><p>This creature acts and reacts as if it had Intelligence 10. However, its mind is artificial, so mind influencing spells have no effect. The creature is immune to poison and requires no sleep or sustenance. It is not undead and cannot be turned.</p><h2>Scarecrow</h2><p class=\"f\">Scarecrows are enchanted creatures made from the same materials as normal scarecrows. Though non-intelligent, they can follow simple, one- or two-phrase orders from the priest who created them. They do so to the best of their ability, without regard to their own safety.</p><p>Each scarecrow is unique, but all share several characteristics. Their bodies, arms, and legs are always made of cut wood bound with rope. Tattered rags cover the frame, and are sometimes stuffed with grass or straw. A hollow gourd with a carved face serves as head. Once animated, a fiery light burns in the scarecrow's eye sockets. Scarecrows are light but slow. Their leg and elbow joints bend both ways, so they move with an uneven, jerky gait, and the head spins freely.</p><p>Scarecrows do not speak, but cackle madly when attacking.</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Combat:</b> Once per round, a scarecrow can gaze at one creature within 40 feet. Any intelligent person meeting this gaze must make a successful saving throw vs. spells or be fascinated, standing transfixed, arms hanging limply, allowing the scarecrow to strike again and again (automatic hit each round). The charm lasts until the scarecrow either dies or leaves the area for a full turn. The scarecrow's touch causes 1d6 damage and has an effect identical to the gaze (saving throws apply). A scarecrow attacks one victim at a time, striking the first person charmed until dead. While slaying its victim, the scarecrow uses its gaze attack to charm other opponents as possible. Scarecrows attack until destroyed or ordered to stop.</p><p>Scarecrows are vulnerable to fire. Fire-based attacks gain a +1 bonus to the attack roll and a +1 damage bonus per die. The magic that created them keeps their tattered parts from decomposing and shields them from the effects of cold.</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Conscious Scarecrows</b></p>  <p class=\"ni\">Most scarecrows disintegrate when their creators die, but a few (10%) become conscious, gaining an evil alignment, average Intelligence (8-10), and great cunning. They gain a desire for self-preservation, so their morale drops to elite (13-14). They hide by day and stalk the night, committing acts of evil. Because scarecrows hate fire and are immune to cold, conscious scarecrows try to reach colder climes. During the trek they kill everything they encounter, including those who pose no threat. Conscious scarecrows hate all life and kill humans and demihumans whenever possible.</p><p></p><br clear=\"all\" style=\"clear:both; height:0;\">\r\n","images":["<img src=\"grf/xx.gif\" width=\"150\" height=\"75\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Advanced Dungeons & Dragons 2nd Edition\" title=\"Advanced Dungeons & Dragons 2nd Edition\" align=\"right\">","<img src=\"img/golem5.gif\" alt=\"Golem V\" title=\"Golem V\" border=\"0\" width=\"300\" height=\"360\" style=\"text-align:right;\" align=\"right\">","<img src=\"grf/tsr_sm.png\" width=\"56\" height=\"59\" border=\"0\" alt=\"TSR\">"],"setting":"Advanced Dungeons & Dragons 2nd Edition","statblock":{"Necrophidius":{"Activity Cycle":"Any","Alignment":"Neutral","Armor Class":"2","Climate/Terrain":"Any","Damage/Attack":"1-8","Diet":"None","Frequency":"Very rare","Hit Dice":"2","Intelligence":"Non- (0)","Magic Resistance":"Nil","Morale":"Fearless (19-20)","Movement":"9","No. Appearing":"1","No. of Attacks":"1","Organization":"Solitary","Size":"L (12' long)","Special Attacks":"See below","Special Defenses":"See below","THAC0":"19","Treasure":"Nil","XP Value":"270"},"Scarecrow":{"Activity Cycle":"Any","Alignment":"Neutral","Armor Class":"6","Climate/Terrain":"Any","Damage/Attack":"1-6 + charm","Diet":"None","Frequency":"Very rare","Hit Dice":"5","Intelligence":"Non- (0)","Magic Resistance":"Nil","Morale":"Fearless (19-20)","Movement":"6","No. Appearing":"1","No. of Attacks":"1 + gaze","Organization":"Solitary","Size":"M (6' tall)","Special Attacks":"See below","Special Defenses":"See below","THAC0":"15","Treasure":"Nil","XP Value":"1,400"}},"title":"Golem V"},"sources":["2140"],"statblock_names":[],"title":"Golem V","prev_key":"golem4","next_key":"golem6","catelog_book":"2140","catelog_setting":"add2_01","monster_path":"/catalog/add2_01/2140/golem5"}},"staticQueryHashes":[],"slicesMap":{}}
