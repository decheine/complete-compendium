They are smaller (2 feet long) and nonaggressive unless provoked. THAC0 19.</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Rabbits</b> are difficult to surprise or catch due to their sensitive eyesight, hearing, nose, and natural paranoia.</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Raccoons</b> only attack if cornered or rabid (10% chance). The pelts are worth one gp.</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Squirrels</b> have good vision and hearing.</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Flying squirrels</b> have furry membranes that enable them to glide five feet for each one foot they drop.</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Giant black squirrels</b> are 2-foot-long residents of evil-dominated forests.
