Strangely enough, a brain mole must establish contact before using psychic drain. Furthermore, it can only perform psychic drain upon psionicists or psionic creatures. However, it does not have to put them into a trance or a deep sleep first, it just starts siphoning away psionic energy.</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Combat:</b> A brain mole commonly attacks its victim in forests or underground; in either case, the creature is usually out of its direct line of sight. The mole waits for a psionically endowed being to appear above it, or it will burrow in search of prey.</p><p>Brain moles have an innate psionic sense and can automatically detect any psionic activity within 200 yards. However, they can only feed on psionic energy when their victim is nearby: within 30 yards if the victim is a psionicist or psionic creature, 30 feet if the victim is a wild talent. The mole can't get a fix on its prey until the victim actually uses a psionic power.</p><p>Once a brain mole locates a victim it will attempt to establish contact. If contact is made, it will attempt to feed. If the victim is a wild talent, feeding is accomplished by using mindwipe. If the victim is a psionicist (or psionic creature), feeding is accomplished through amplification.</p><p>A brain mole does not attack maliciously. It must feed at least once a week or it will die.</p><p>A brain mole can perform mindwipe up to a range of 30 feet. Strangely enough, a brain mole must establish contact before using psychic drain.

Large brain mole towns of up to 3d6 family units have been reported. Of course, these only occur in places frequently traveled by the psionically empowered</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Ecology:</b> Though brain moles can be dangerous to some, others keep them as pets. The moles are rather friendly, and easily tamed. They are favored by royalty, who enjoy the special protection which only brain moles can provide. Some sages claim that even a dead brain mole can offer protection from psionic attacks, provided the carcass is worn about one's neck as a medallion. Sometimes, nobles who have been harassed by a particular psionicist will send heroes out on quests for the little furry rodents. On the open market, adult brain moles sell for 50 gp. Youngsters sell for 5 gp each.</p><br clear=\"all\" style=\"clear:both; height:0;\">\r\n","images":["<img src=\"grf/xx.gif\" width=\"150\" height=\"75\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Advanced Dungeons & Dragons 2nd Edition\" title=\"Advanced Dungeons & Dragons 2nd Edition\" align=\"right\">","<img src=\"img/braimole.gif\" alt=\"Brain Mole\" title=\"Brain Mole\" border=\"0\" width=\"300\" height=\"360\" style=\"text-align:right;\" align=\"right\">","<img src=\"grf/tsr_sm.png\" width=\"56\" height=\"59\" border=\"0\" alt=\"TSR\">"],"setting":"Advanced Dungeons & Dragons 2nd Edition","statblock":{"Brain Mole":{"Activity Cycle":"Night","Alignment":"Neutral","Armor Class":"9","Climate/Terrain":"Any/Below ground","Damage/Attack":"Nil","Diet":"Psionic energy","Frequency":"Very rare","Hit Dice":"1 hp","Intelligence":"Animal (1)","Magic Resistance":"Nil","Morale":"Unsteady (5-7)","Movement":"1, Br 3","No. Appearing":"1-3","No. of Attacks":"0","Organization":"Family","Size":"T (3&rdquo; long)","Special Attacks":"Psionic","Special Defenses":"Psionic","THAC0":"0","Treasure":"Nil","XP Value":"35"}},"title":"Brain Mole"},"sources":["2140"],"statblock_names":[],"title":"Brain Mole","prev_key":"beholde2","next_key":"brokenon","catelog_book":"2140","catelog_setting":"add2_01","monster_path":"/catalog/add2_01/2140/braimole"}},"staticQueryHashes":[],"slicesMap":{}}
