Though they seldom seek out company, they willingly converse with visitors who do not try to steal from them.</p><p>At birth, crystal dragons have glossy white scales. As the dragons age, their scales become translucent. Moonlight and starlight causes their scales to luminesce, while bright sunlight lends them a dazzling brilliance which makes crystal dragons almost unbearable to look at.</p><p>Crystal dragons speak their own tongue and the tongue common to all gem dragons, and 10% of hatchling crystal dragons have an ability to communicate with any intelligent creature. The chance to possess this ability increases 5% per age category of the dragon.</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Combat:</b> Crystal dragons greatly prefer conversation to combat, and often use charm person early in any conversation. They do not initially hide, but if visitors become hostile, a crystal dragon will retreat immediately to observe its enemies with its special abilities, and plan an attack. Often, it uses its breath weapon first, to weaken and disorient enemies. Spells and other abilities are used as needed, with claws and bite a last resort.</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Breath Weapon/Special Abilities:</b> This dragon's breath weapon is a cone of glowing shards; the cone is 60 feet long, 5 feet wide at the dragon's mouth, and 25 feet wide at the base. Creatures caught in the blast can save vs. breath weapon for half damage, and must make a second saving throw vs. breath weapon or be blinded by the dazzling shards for one turn per age level of the dragon. The shards shine as bright as daylight, and can be seen for miles. Creatures within 60 feet must save vs. breath weapon or be dazzled, incurring a penalty of -2 to attack rolls for one turn per age level of the dragon. A crystal dragon casts spells and uses magical abilities at 5th level, plus its combat modifier.</p><p>Crystal dragons are born immune to light-based attacks and normal cold, and able to cast <i>charm person</i> at will. As they age, they gain these additional powers:</p><p><i>Juvenile: color spray</i> three times a day. <i>Mature adult: suggestion</i> three times a day. <i>Very old: luckscale</i> once a day. This allows the dragon to enchant one of its scales as a stone of good luck. The enchantment lasts one hour per age category of the dragon. Such scales are given to friendly visitors. <i>Wyrm: control winds</i> three times a day.</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Habitat/Society:</b> Crystal dragons prefer cold, open areas with clear skies, and they enjoy stargazing. They have been known to build snow forts, create beautiful snow sculptures, and throw balls of snow at various targets. They are fun-loving and mischievous. Crystal dragons are reasonably good parents, if somewhat irresponsible.</p><p>Crystal dragons are hunted by some <a href=\"/appendix/dragcwhi\">white dragons</a>. However, a rare crystal dragon will adopt a young white dragon, to teach it to be friendly. Though generally friendly, they bear great enmity towards all giants, who sometimes try to enslave them.</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Ecology:</b> Crystal dragons prefer gems and metal ores to all other foods.</p><br><table><tr class=\"cn\"><th>Age</th><th>Body Lgt.
