They are generally created by powerful wizards and employed as guards or servants in a wide variety of settings.</p><h2>Caryatid Column</h2><p class=\"f\">The caryatid column is a beautiful and wondrous construct. Before activation, it looks like the classical architectural work it is named for, standing about 7 feet tall, and resembling a finely carved pillar in the shape of a beautiful young girl. Close examination reveals that the maiden has a slender sword in her left hand, but there is no indication that the column is anything other than what it appears to be. Once constructed and animated, it is usually assigned to keep watch over a valuable object or special places. It does so, remaining motionless, until its preset activation conditions are triggered (these depend on the creator's instructions). As soon as this happens, the column moves to take action against those who have triggered it.</p><p>When activated, the caryatid column undergoes a stunning and swift transformation. The smooth, grey stone that was once its skin changes hue to become light or dark flesh tones (depending on the nature of the carving), the eyes come alive with a gleaming white light, and the thin blade transforms into a fine weapon of gleaming steel.</p><p>In combat, the column lashes out with its gleaming sword, causing 2d4 points of damage with each hit. The column's magical nature gives it a +4 bonus to saving throws, and all nonmagical weapons inflict only half damage. Magical weapons inflict full damage, but do not receive the magical bonus normally due them. For example, a <i>long sword +2</i> does not gain its +2 bonus, but inflicts normal long sword damage.</p><p>There is a 25% chance that a weapon shatters when it successfully strikes a caryatid column. This chance is reduced by 5% for each plus of the weapon. Thus, a sword +2 has only a 15% chance of breaking. A magical weapon with no attack bonus is considered a +1 weapon when checking for shattering.</p><p>A <i>stone to flesh</i>, <i>transmute rock to mud</i>, or <i>stone shape</i> spell destroys the column instantly if it fails its saving throw.</p><p>When a caryatid column has completed its task, it returns to its waiting position and reverts to stone. If it is killed in combat, it (and its sword) reverts to stone for 2d6 rounds, at the end of which time it crumbles into dust.</p><h2>Juggernaut</h2><p class=\"f\">The juggernaut generally appears as a huge, powerful stone vehicle of some sort, with wheels or rollers for locomotion.</p><p>A juggernaut is clumsy and slow moving, but it makes up for these handicaps by rolling right over opponents in a deadly crushing attack. A juggernaut has a movement rate of 3 in its first round of animation. This increases by 3 each round to a maximum of 12. A juggernaut is slow to turn, and can change direction only 90 degrees for every 30 feet of movement.</p><p>Anyone caught in the path of a juggernaut charge is run over by the thundering behemoth, though the juggernaut must make a normal attack roll if the victim can avoid the charge. A hit indicates that the victim is crushed, suffering 10d10 points of damage. In addition, every item carried by the victim must roll a saving throw vs. crushing blow to avoid destruction. A successful saving throw vs. death magic entitles the victim to only half damage, but it does not protect his equipment.</p><p>Some juggernauts are a unique crossbreed of stone golem and <a href=\"/appendix/mimic\">mimic</a>. Once animated, these juggernauts can alter their shape as the mimics do. They can grow up to six limbs, each designed for current needs.</p><p>For example, if it wishes to sound a warning, a limb may grow into a trumpet or horn. In combat, its limbs become maces or hammers that inflict 2d6 points of damage each, due to its great strength. A juggernaut can rarely bring more than two limbs to bear on a single opponent.</p><h2>Stone Guardian</h2><p class=\"f\">In combat, a guardian slams opponents with its massive arms, each of which inflicts 1d8+1 points of damage. The stone guardian suffers onlyï¿½ damage from edged weapons and &#189; damage from all cold, fire, or electrical attacks. Normal missiles cause no damage. A stone guardian can be instantly destroyed by a <i>stone to flesh</i>, <i>transmute rock to mud</i>, <i>stone shape</i>, or <i>dig</i> spell; it is not entitled to a saving throw.</p><br clear=\"all\" style=\"clear:both; height:0;\">\r\n","images":["<img src=\"grf/xx.gif\" width=\"150\" height=\"75\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Advanced Dungeons & Dragons 2nd Edition\" title=\"Advanced Dungeons & Dragons 2nd Edition\" align=\"right\">","<img src=\"grf/tsr_sm.png\" width=\"56\" height=\"59\" border=\"0\" alt=\"TSR\">"],"setting":"Advanced Dungeons & Dragons 2nd Edition","statblock":{"Caryatid Column":{"Activity Cycle":"Any","Alignment":"Neutral","Armor Class":"5","Climate/Terrain":"Any","Damage/Attack":"2-8","Diet":"Nil","Frequency":"Very rare","Hit Dice":"5 (22 hit points)","Intelligence":"Non- (0)","Magic Resistance":"Nil","Morale":"Fearless (20)","Movement":"6","No. Appearing":"1-12","No. of Attacks":"1","Organization":"Solitary","Size":"M (7' tall)","Special Attacks":"Nil","Special Defenses":"See below","THAC0":"15","Treasure":"Nil","XP Value":"420"},"Juggernaut":{"Activity Cycle":"Any","Alignment":"Neutral","Armor Class":"2","Climate/Terrain":"Any","Damage/Attack":"2-12","Diet":"Nil","Frequency":"Very rare","Hit Dice":"10-13","Intelligence":"Non- (0)","Magic Resistance":"Nil","Morale":"Elite to champion (13-16)","Movement":"3-12","No. Appearing":"1","No. of Attacks":"Up to 6","Organization":"Solitary","Size":"L to H (8-20')","Special Attacks":"Crushing","Special Defenses":"Immune to fire","THAC0":"10 HD: 11<br>11-12 HD: 9<br>13 HD: 7","Treasure":"Nil","XP Value":"10 HD: 3,000<br>+1,000 per additional Hit Die"},"Stone Guardian":{"Activity Cycle":"Any","Alignment":"Neutral","Armor Class":"2","Climate/Terrain":"Any","Damage/Attack":"2-9/2-9","Diet":"Nil","Frequency":"Very rare","Hit Dice":"4+4","Intelligence":"Non- (0)","Magic Resistance":"Nil","Morale":"Fearless (20)","Movement":"9","No. Appearing":"1-4","No. of Attacks":"2","Organization":"Solitary","Size":"M to L (6-8')","Special Attacks":"Nil","Special Defenses":"See below","THAC0":"15","Treasure":"Nil","XP Value":"420"}},"title":"Golem VI (Stone Variants)"},"sources":["2140"],"statblock_names":[],"title":"Golem VI (Stone Variants)","prev_key":"golem5","next_key":"gorgon","catelog_book":"2140","catelog_setting":"add2_01","monster_path":"/catalog/add2_01/2140/golem6"}},"staticQueryHashes":[],"slicesMap":{}}
