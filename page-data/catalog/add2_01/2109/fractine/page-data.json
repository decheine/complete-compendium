When at rest, fractines resemble vast mirrors and can be manipulated to function as excellent scrying mirrors. To do so, a spelljamming scholar must focus his willpower on the subject he wishes to view, while touching a fractine. A Wisdom check (modified by a DM-selected difficulty penalty of -1 to -10) must succeed to view the subject. Failure results in 1d10 turns of exhaustion and a 10% chance that the fractine is stirred into motion, One can examine a subject's past, future, and weaknesses using the right techniques. However, the fractine's distorted surface may blur the results, obscuring crucial information.</p><p>Fractines are most commonly encountered in space in an active state, tumbling or folding and refolding like a piece of origami. They react to a variety of stimuli. They are attracted to motion, loud sounds, and magical energy. However, large bursts of energy (such as a <i>fireball</i> or <i>lightning bolt</i>) repulse fractines for 1d4 rounds. Spells affecting air can be used to control fractines. (The caster must roll a successful saving throw vs. spell each round or lose control.)</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Combat:</b> A fractine causes a variety of harmful, distortional efects. Physical attacks may be used to destroy or alter its course, but only silver or magical weapons or spells cause any damage. Furthermore, a fractine must be struck on one of its two faces to cause any damage.</p><p>Any physical damage to a fractine causes damage to the attacker. The attacker suffers 1d4&times;25% of the inflicted damage (round fractions up), though he receives a saving throw vs. petrification to suffer only half damage.</p><p>Once per round there is a 1% chance per point of damage inflicted that a fractine shatters into 1d4 independent fragments, each with one-third of the remaining HD and hp (shattering releases any held creatures).</p><p>A fractine receives a saving throw vs. any magical effect, if the effect gets past its magic resistance. If the saving throw is successful, the magical effect is redirected at random.</p><p>A fractine attacks by falling on its targets. The fractine passes through its victims, causing 2d4 points of damage and forcing a saving throw vs. breath weapon to avoid a special effect. If the saving throw fails, roll 1d20 for the effect.</p><table class=\"ip\"><tr class=\"bk\"><th>Roll</th><th>Effect</th></tr><tr><td>1-3</td><td>Blink (random direction and orientation)</td></tr><tr><td>4-5</td><td>Teleport (1d4&times;10 feet into air)</td></tr><tr><td>6-7</td><td>Deport* (Character's mind views his body from another plane; must roll Wisdom checks each round to control)</td></tr><tr><td>8-9</td><td>Turn ethereal* (AbIe to cast magic only, intangible)</td></tr><tr><td>10-12</td><td>Distortion* (Character's form suffers a distortion, DM's choice - Effects may shorten or lengthen limbs, make fat or thin, flatten, stretch, etc. A Dexterity check must succeed each round to perform any desired actions.</td></tr><tr><td>13</td><td>Transpose* (Part of body is exchanged with that of another victim, or it vanishes.

Shattered fragments either follow divergent paths or merge once again.</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Ecology:</b> Fractines consume life, light, darkness, and magical energy. Each level, Hit Dice, spell level, and bonus provides 1 point of food. When a fractine has consumed a number of points equal to its total hit points, it leaves. Its movement rate is increased by 1 per point of light consumed and decreased by 1 per point of darkness (maximum of 24 and minimum of 1).</p><br clear=\"all\" style=\"clear:both; height:0;\">\r\n","images":["<img src=\"grf/sj.gif\" width=\"150\" height=\"75\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Spelljammer\" title=\"Spelljammer\" align=\"right\">","<img src=\"img/fractine.gif\" alt=\"Fractine\" title=\"Fractine\" border=\"0\" width=\"300\" height=\"360\" style=\"text-align:right;\" align=\"right\">","<img src=\"grf/add2_01.gif\" width=\"200\" height=\"56\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Advanced Dungeons & Dragons 2nd Edition\">"],"setting":"Spelljammer","statblock":{"Fractine":{"Activity Cycle":"Always","Alignment":"Neutral","Armor Class":"-1","Climate/Terrain":"Any space","Damage/Attack":"2-8","Diet":"Light and magic","Frequency":"Very rare","Hit Dice":"6-13","Intelligence":"Unknown","Magic Resistance":"25%","Morale":"Fearless (20)","Movement":"Fl 1 to 24 (A)","No. Appearing":"1","No. of Attacks":"Area of effect (1 sq. ft. per HD)","Organization":"Solitary","Size":"H (1 sq. ft. per HD)","Special Attacks":"See below","Special Defenses":"See below","THAC0":"6 HD: 15<br>7-8 HD: 13<br>9-10 HD: 11<br>11-12 HD: 9<br>13 HD: 7","Treasure":"Nil","XP Value":"6 HD: 2,000 (+1,000 per additional HD)"}},"title":"Fractine"},"sources":["2109"],"statblock_names":[],"title":"Fractine","prev_key":"focoid","next_key":"gianspse","catelog_book":"2109","catelog_setting":"add2_01"}},"staticQueryHashes":[],"slicesMap":{}}
