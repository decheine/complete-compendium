But, like all dragons, he dreams of becoming much more powerful and of someday seizing control of a city-state.</p><p>Most of the time, Farcluun disguises himself as a powerful human male around 6 ½' tall with long black hair. This effect is produced by a special amulet he created himself. The disguise is virtually impenetrable by anyone save a more powerful dragon. However. the disguise does not alter his mass, which anyone who tries to lift or otherwise move him will quickly find out.</p><p>While a man, Farcluun gained a reputation for cruelty rivaled by few others. To fuel his transformation he rounded up an entire tribe of <a href=\"/appendix/halfatha\">halflings</a> and had them burned alive. Though some wouldn't fault him (halflings are savage cannibals, after all), the act was still undeniably cruel. This sadistic streak did not lessen as Farcluun gained power, but rather increased. Those who cross him should spend the rest of their lives looking over their shoulders for reprisals.</p><p>As with all his endeavors, Farcluun is treating the recover-y of the <i>black waters</i> scroll like a military campaign. He wishes nothing to go awry and will do everything in his power to regulate and control the project to avoid mishaps.</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Combat:</b> Farcluun is very canny in combat, but will try to stay out of physical confrontation if he can avoid it. If forced to fight, he uses a sword he had specially forged for his enhanced strength and mass. This dragonblade looks like a normal short sword, but in fact does 1d12 points of damage and cant be used by normal beings.</p><p>Farcluun far prefers the use of psionics and magic and will use them to dispatch foes whenever possible. The DM should be ruthless in playing him. He is one of the most powerful creatures the characters are likely to encounter and should be treated as such. Killing Farcluun should be a major accomplishment.</p><p></p><br clear=\"all\" style=\"clear:both; height:0;\">\r\n","images":["<img src=\"grf/ds.gif\" width=\"150\" height=\"75\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Dark Sun\" title=\"Dark Sun\" align=\"right\">","<img src=\"img/farcluun.gif\" alt=\"Farcluun, the Dragon\" title=\"Farcluun, the Dragon\" border=\"0\" width=\"300\" height=\"360\" style=\"text-align:right;\" align=\"right\">","<img src=\"grf/tsr_sm.png\" width=\"56\" height=\"59\" border=\"0\" alt=\"TSR\">"],"setting":"Dark Sun","statblock":{"Farcluun, the Dragon":{"Activity Cycle":"Any","Alignment":"Lawful Evil","Armor Class":"-5 (3)","Climate/Terrain":"Any","Damage/Attack":"1d12 (dragonblade)","Diet":"Omnivore","Frequency":"Unique","Hit Dice":"35+10/130hp (50hp)","Intelligence":"Genius (17-18)","Magic Resistance":"Nil","Morale":"Fanatic (17-18)","Movement":"15 (10)","No. Appearing":"1","No. of Attacks":"2","Organization":"Solitary","Size":"M","Special Attacks":"Spells","Special Defenses":"Spell*","THAC0":"10","Treasure":"E (in lair)","XP Value":"20,000 (7,500)"}},"title":"Farcluun, the Dragon"},"sources":["2417"],"statblock_names":[],"title":"Farcluun, the Dragon","prev_key":"cursdead","next_key":"cursdead","catelog_book":"2417","catelog_setting":"ds","monster_path":"/catalog/ds/2417/farcluun"}},"staticQueryHashes":[],"slicesMap":{}}
