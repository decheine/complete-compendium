Of course, Dregoth wanted someone special to oversee his quest for true godhood. He wanted a High Priest made in his own image-a <a href=\"/appendix/dray\">dray</a>. At the time, which was shortly after Dregoth's death and Guistenal's destruction, the dragon king had not yet perfected the dray transformation process. Only in death did the transformation stabilize. So to become Dregoth's High Priest, Absalom had to die.</p><p>Absalom underwent the imperfect transformation process, mutated into a perfect dray, then was killed to halt the process from changing him further. Death was not the end, however. Dregoth brought Absalom back as a <i>morg</i>, an undead creature similar to the <a href=\"/appendix/mummgrea\">greater mummies</a> of other worlds. Now he wears the ornate robes of Dregoth's High Priest, though the finery does little to hide his mummified, dead-gray features. (Absalom is not wrapped in rotting strips of cloth.) He stands seven feet tall and looks like a well-preserved second generation dray who died thousands of years ago but continues to walk around. He wears the latest version of Dregoth's holy symbol around his neck-a metal disc bearing the image of a roaring dragon head inside a crimson circle.</p><p>The High Priest communicates as he did in life, speaking the language of ancient Giustenal. He can talk to others using the <i>tongues</i> spell.</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Combat:</b>Absalom strikes with a powerful blow, using his sharp claws to inflict 3d6 points of damage. He also carries a metal <i>long sword +3</i>. The ancient weapon's point was broken off long ago, but when Absalom grips the hilt the ghostly image of the sharp point appears. The long sword causes 1d8+ 3 points of damage, plus an additional 2 points due to Absalom's great strength.</p><p>Like all morgs (though very few of the entities are known to exist on Athas), Absalom can only be harmed by magical weapons. <i>Sleep</i>, <i>charm</i>, <i>hold</i> and heat-based spells have no effect on him. Cold-based spells cause normal damage.</p><p>As Dregoth's High Priest, Absalom has access to templar spells. He receives the following number of spells: 7 1st level, 7 2nd level, 7 3rd level, 7 4th level, 5 5th level, 3 6th level, 2 7th level. He also has a limited amount of psionic powers to call upon.</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Habitat/Society:</b> Absalom serves as High Priest of New Giustenal, indoctrinating the dray in the religion of the undead dragon. He preaches daily in the Temple of the Dragon, teaching about Dregoth's rise to godhood and the coming Coruscation. Every dray in New Giustenal respects the High Priest, and all flock to listen to him sing the praises of Dregoth.</p><p>The High Priest takes is position very seriously. He truly believes that Dregoth is a god. However, while he agrees with most of Dregoth's proclamations, Absalom takes exception to a vital point. Absalom believes that all dray are Dregoth's children-even the banished dray of Kragmorta. Over the centuries, Absalom has made a habit of administering to the first generation dray's needs, even though Dregoth has forbidden any contact with the banished ones. He often travels to Kragmorta to teach them and see how they are faring.</p><p>Recently, Absalom discovered Dregoth's deception of the Spirit of Kragmorta. He found out too late, however, to save over 300 first generation dray from being converted into undead warriors. Absalom hopes to find a way to save the remainder of Kragmorta's dray before more march into Dregoth's trap. He doesn't want to do anything directly or openly, as he doesn't want to appear to be challenging Dregoth's plans. Any visitors to the under-regions who help sway the dray from following the advice of the Spirit of Kragmorta receive Absalom's gratitude - and perhaps even his assistance.</p><p>As the High Priest of New Giustenal, Absalom is an imposing and awe-inspiring figure. He can't mingle with the common folk, for he is too easily recognized. To remedy that, Absalom uses his metamorphosis psionic power to take on the form of Akrag, owner of the public baths. Akrag is a cantankerous and seedy second generation dray who constantly watches and listens to gauge the mood of the general public. He also keeps an eye on the Blackjaw River, watching the comings and goings of the templars charged with the disposal of the dead. Absalom knows that Dregoth is building an undead army in a cave located along the river, and as Akrag he keeps count of just how large and powerful it is becoming.</p>   <p class=\"f\"><b>Ecology:</b> Morgs can only be created by the sorcerer-kings of Athas. The creation of so powerful an undead servant requires an expenditure of personal energy and the life forces of 1,000 loyal citizens. Absalom was created in this way, after being subjected to an early version of the dray transformation process. As a morg, Absalom plays no further part in the natural ecosystem. He does not require food or water, though he rejuvenates himself with a small portion of every blood sacrifice made to Dregoth.</p>\n","images":["<img src=\"grf/ds.gif\" width=\"150\" height=\"75\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Dark Sun\" title=\"Dark Sun\" align=\"right\">","<img src=\"img/absalom.gif\" alt=\"Absalom (Unique Morg)\" title=\"Absalom (Unique Morg)\" border=\"0\" width=\"300\" height=\"360\" style=\"text-align:right;\" align=\"right\">","<img src=\"grf/tsr_sm.png\" width=\"56\" height=\"59\" border=\"0\" alt=\"TSR\">"],"setting":"Dark Sun","statblock":{"Absalom (Unique Morg)":{"Activity Cycle":"Any","Alignment":"Lawful Evil","Armor Class":"4","Climate/Terrain":"New Giusetenal","Damage/Attack":"3-18 or 1-8+5","Diet":"Nil","Frequency":"Unique","Hit Dice":"17 (97 hit points)","Intelligence":"Exceptional (16)","Magic Resistance":"Nil","Morale":"Fanatic (18)","Movement":"9","No. Appearing":"1","No. of Attacks":"1","Organization":"Solitary","Size":"M (7 feet tall)","Special Attacks":"See below","Special Defenses":"See below","THAC0":"10","Treasure":"V, Y","XP Value":"10,000"}},"title":"Absalom (Unique Morg)"},"sources":["2432"],"statblock_names":[],"title":"Absalom (Unique Morg)","prev_key":"wallwalk","next_key":"beetledr","catelog_book":"2432","catelog_setting":"ds","monster_path":"/catalog/ds/2432/absalom"}},"staticQueryHashes":[],"slicesMap":{}}
