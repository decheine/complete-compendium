They are slightly taller and somewhat stockier than most elves.</p><p>Since most are raised in an atmosphere of shame, half-elves are insecure and unsure of themselves. In extreme instances, this insecurity manifests itself in rebellious or anti-social behavior. Others are trusting of strangers, yet lack the openness necessary to establish true and lasting friendship. Many are natural leaders, but few feel worthy of a leader's responsibility Regardless of their disposition, all half-elves are loners - brooding, quiet, and struggling with self-doubt.</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Combat:</b> Half.elves are excellent fighters with no obvious tears. If there is a flaw in their fighting style, it iS their tendency to perform life-threatening acts of bravado. A half-elf often challenges the most formidable opponent in a group of attackers or volunteers for the most dangerous missions.</p><p>Half-elves particularly excel at melee attacks; magic-using half-elves usually reserve their spells for emergencies or to assist their companions. Long swords are their favorite weapons, but they also frequently use daggers and long bows. They wear a variety of armor, preferring chain mail when it is avariable. Unlike other elven races, half-elves can be skilled horsemen.</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Habitat/Society:</b> Because elves and humans are often attracted to each other, intermarriage is all but inevitable. No elven race, however, sanctions such marriages, forcing elven and human lovers into discreet relationships.</p><p>Reaction to half-elves from other races varies. The race-conscious <a href=\"/appendix/elfhsilv\">Silvanesti</a>, for instance, are particularly revolted by interracial marriages. <a href=\"/appendix/elfhqual\">Qualinesti</a> are more compassionate toward half-elves, treating them coldly but allowing them a place in their societies. However, half-elves seldom rise to positions of trust or responsibility in a Qualinesti community. <a href=\"/appendix/elfwkago\">Kagonesti</a> respect half-elves as they would any creature of nature, but they are never accepted as full members of a tribe.</p><p>Humans have a mixed reaction to half-elves. Years ago, half-elves in human society were considered a great blessing and brought honor to a human household, but this attitude has diminished considerably with the passage of time. Humans now view half-elves as a strange and vaguely inferior race.</p><p>There is no society or community that consists solely of half-elves. Though some halt-elves learn trades or crafts most drift from place to place</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Ecology:</b> Half-elves feel kinship with no race, although they occasionally find lasting friendship with humans and <a href=\"/appendix/dwarhill\">Neidar</a>. They prefer simple foods, but have no particular preferences.</p><br clear=\"all\" style=\"clear:both; height:0;\">\r\n","images":["<img src=\"grf/dl.gif\" width=\"150\" height=\"75\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Dragonlance\" title=\"Dragonlance\" align=\"right\">","<img src=\"img/elfhalf.gif\" alt=\"Elf, Half-\" title=\"Elf, Half-\" border=\"0\" width=\"300\" height=\"360\" style=\"text-align:right;\" align=\"right\">","<img src=\"grf/add2_01.gif\" width=\"200\" height=\"56\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Advanced Dungeons & Dragons 2nd Edition\">"],"setting":"Dragonlance","statblock":{"Elf, Half-":{"Activity Cycle":"Any","Alignment":"Varies, but usually lawful or neutral good","Armor Class":"5 (10)","Climate/Terrain":"Tropical, subtropical and temperate/Forests and plains","Damage/Attack":"1-10 (weapon)","Diet":"Omnivore","Frequency":"Very rare","Hit Dice":"1+1","Intelligence":"Varies (4-18)","Magic Resistance":"See below","Morale":"Elite (13)","Movement":"9 (12)","No. Appearing":"1","No. of Attacks":"1","Organization":"Solitary","Size":"M (5-6' tall)","Special Attacks":"See below","Special Defenses":"See below","THAC0":"19 (18)","Treasure":"K,V&times;&#189;","XP Value":"Varies"}},"title":"Elf, Half-"},"sources":["2105"],"statblock_names":[],"title":"Elf, Half-","prev_key":"dwarzakh","next_key":"elfhqual","catelog_book":"2105","catelog_setting":"dl"}},"staticQueryHashes":[],"slicesMap":{}}
