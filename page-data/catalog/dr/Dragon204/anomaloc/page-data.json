Superficially, it resembles a giant squid with curved walrus tusks. Closer examination, however, shows that the tusks are really tentacular appendages with additional grasping arms on them, while the tail fins are far longer and broader than a squid's. Anomalocaris is a strong swimmer that aggressively chasing its prey.</p><p>When attacking, Anomalocaris seizes its prey with its grasping appendages, doing 1d8 points of constriction damage with each, then shoves it into the round mouth (2d8 points of biting damage). This creature follows the swallowing rules above. This is another case where a swallowed victim won't have to worry much about taking half damage from the attacks of would-be rescuers, because he won't last long. It's not a matter of digestive juices dissolving him, either. If he does not break free right away (a Strength check made at -2 or a Fitness roll at -10), he will discover to his dismay that Anomalocaris has row upon row of crushing teeth, extending all the way through the front end of the creature's gut! Simply put, this means that the swallowed PC will take 2d8 points of biting damage for the next three turns. Then, and only then, will he be exposed to the monster's digestive juices (1d8 points of damage per turn).</p><p>Damaging Anomalocaris won't be easy, either. The entire animal has a tough hide that, in BUGHUNTERS terms, removes two damage points and one lethality rating from each attack. Remember, too, the difficulty of using certain weapons on a opponent that is always in the water. Everyone fighting the creature may well wind up in the water, no matter how the fight begins, as Anomalocaris is more than powerful enough to flip over a small boat, even one large enough to hold an entire infantry squad or typical AD&D adventuring party.</p>\n","images":["<img src=\"grf/dr.gif\" width=\"150\" height=\"75\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Dragon Magazine\" title=\"Dragon Magazine\" align=\"right\">","<img src=\"img/anomaloc.gif\" alt=\"Anomalocaris\" title=\"Anomalocaris\" border=\"0\" width=\"300\" height=\"360\" style=\"text-align:right;\" align=\"right\">","<img src=\"grf/tsr_sm.png\" width=\"56\" height=\"59\" border=\"0\" alt=\"TSR\">"],"setting":"Dragon Magazine","statblock":{"Anomalocaris":{"Activity Cycle":"Day","Alignment":"Neutral","Armor Class":"4","Climate/Terrain":"Shallow sea floor","Damage/Attack":"1d8 (x2)/2d8","Diet":"Carnivore/Scavenger","Frequency":"Very rare","Hit Dice":"12","Intelligence":"Animal(1)","Magic Resistance":"Nil","Morale":"Fearless (20)","Movement":"Sw 18","No. Appearing":"1-2","No. of Attacks":"3","Organization":"Solitary","Size":"G (80' long)","Special Attacks":"Swallow whole","Special Defenses":"Nil","THAC0":"9","Treasure":"Nil","XP Value":"6,000"}},"title":"Anomalocaris"},"sources":["Dragon204"],"statblock_names":[],"title":"Anomalocaris","prev_key":"amiskwia","next_key":"hallucac","catelog_book":"Dragon204","catelog_setting":"dr","monster_path":"/catalog/dr/Dragon204/anomaloc"}},"staticQueryHashes":[],"slicesMap":{}}
