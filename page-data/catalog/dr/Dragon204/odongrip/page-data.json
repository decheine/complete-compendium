It has a mouth with a curious ring of teeth on its underside, so its attack method is obvious: drop down on the prey from above, bite in, and start sucking. The bite does 1d6 points of damage initially, with another 1d4 points per round (or BUGHUNTERS turn) due to blood drain. A stricken AD&D character must roll a successful Strength check (as above) to escape; a BUGHUNTERS PC must make a Fitness check at -10 to break free.</p><p>Because of its flexibility, Odontogriphus also has the capability for a constriction attack, dropping itself down on man-sized or smaller prey and wrapping itself around it like an aquatic version of the AD&D game's lurker above. Constriction, whether conducted during AD&D rounds or BUGHUNTERS turns, adds 1d6 damage per attack, and suffocates the victim within 1d4 + 1 rounds (or turns) at most. Even if the character is underwater and has her own air supply, she still suffocates, as this attack prevents her from drawing air into her lungs. All attacks made on the constricting monster will do half damage (rounding down) on the constricting victim.</p><p></p><br clear=\"all\" style=\"clear:both; height:0;\">\r\n","images":["<img src=\"grf/dr.gif\" width=\"150\" height=\"75\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Dragon Magazine\" title=\"Dragon Magazine\" align=\"right\">","<img src=\"img/odongrip.gif\" alt=\"Odontogriphus\" title=\"Odontogriphus\" border=\"0\" width=\"300\" height=\"360\" style=\"text-align:right;\" align=\"right\">","<img src=\"grf/tsr_sm.png\" width=\"56\" height=\"59\" border=\"0\" alt=\"TSR\">"],"setting":"Dragon Magazine","statblock":{"Odontogriphus":{"Activity Cycle":"Day","Alignment":"Neutral","Armor Class":"10","Climate/Terrain":"Shallow sea floor","Damage/Attack":"1d6","Diet":"Carnivore/Scavenger","Frequency":"Uncommon","Hit Dice":"4","Intelligence":"Animal(1)","Magic Resistance":"Nil","Morale":"Average (8)","Movement":"6, SW 12","No. Appearing":"1-8","No. of Attacks":"1","Organization":"Solitary","Size":"H (18' long)","Special Attacks":"Blood drain, constriction","Special Defenses":"Nil","THAC0":"17","Treasure":"Nil","XP Value":"270"}},"title":"Odontogriphus"},"sources":["Dragon204"],"statblock_names":[],"title":"Odontogriphus","prev_key":"marrella","next_key":"opabinia","catelog_book":"Dragon204","catelog_setting":"dr","monster_path":"/catalog/dr/Dragon204/odongrip"}},"staticQueryHashes":[],"slicesMap":{}}
