It is otherwise noted for three things: a pair of antennaelike frontal appendages, each ending with three whips; an armored shell (in the BUGHUNTERS game, this blocks four points of damage per attack and reduces lethality ratings by two); and a saw-edged tail spine that may have been used for digging. (It is not a weapon, but you don't need to tell the players that!)</p><p>In battle, Leanchoilia lashes out with its whiplike arms, doing 1d6 points of damage with each. Aside from laceration damage, they also may entangle a target of mansize or smaller, making him unable to fight back or escape unless he makes a Strength roll on 1d20 (in the AD&D game) or a Fitness check at -5 (in the BUGHUNTERS game). Prey that has been successfully snagged will be dragged to the mouth, which inflicts 1d4 points of biting damage per combat sequence. As the creature can come out on dry land for an hour or so, it is a considerable threat to human life.</p>\n","images":["<img src=\"grf/dr.gif\" width=\"150\" height=\"75\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Dragon Magazine\" title=\"Dragon Magazine\" align=\"right\">","<img src=\"img/leanchoi.gif\" alt=\"Leanchoilia\" title=\"Leanchoilia\" border=\"0\" width=\"300\" height=\"360\" style=\"text-align:right;\" align=\"right\">","<img src=\"grf/tsr_sm.png\" width=\"56\" height=\"59\" border=\"0\" alt=\"TSR\">"],"setting":"Dragon Magazine","statblock":{"Leanchoilia":{"Activity Cycle":"Day","Alignment":"Neutral","Armor Class":"2","Climate/Terrain":"Shallow sea floor","Damage/Attack":"1d4/1d6 (x2)","Diet":"Carnivore/Scavenger","Frequency":"Uncommon","Hit Dice":"5","Intelligence":"Animal(1)","Magic Resistance":"Nil","Morale":"Average (8)","Movement":"4 (crawling and swimming)","No. Appearing":"1-4","No. of Attacks":"3","Organization":"Solitary","Size":"L (8' long)","Special Attacks":"Entangle","Special Defenses":"Nil","THAC0":"15","Treasure":"Nil","XP Value":"270"}},"title":"Leanchoilia"},"sources":["Dragon204"],"statblock_names":[],"title":"Leanchoilia","prev_key":"hallucig","next_key":"marrella","catelog_book":"Dragon204","catelog_setting":"dr","monster_path":"/catalog/dr/Dragon204/leanchoi"}},"staticQueryHashes":[],"slicesMap":{}}
