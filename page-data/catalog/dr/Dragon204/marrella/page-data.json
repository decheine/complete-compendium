It spends most of its time in the water (the fluffy-looking antennae are gills), but it can spend up to an hour at a time on dry land, and often does so traveling from one body of water to another.</p><p>The Marrella attacks by means of its two wiplike antennae, lashing out for 1d6 points of damage each. In addition, a Marrella at least 10' away from its foe can charge, doing damage through impact with its heavily armored head (2d8 damage points). Attacks on the head are less effective than on the body. </p><p></p><br clear=\"all\" style=\"clear:both; height:0;\">\r\n","images":["<img src=\"grf/dr.gif\" width=\"150\" height=\"75\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Dragon Magazine\" title=\"Dragon Magazine\" align=\"right\">","<img src=\"img/marrella.gif\" alt=\"Marrella\" title=\"Marrella\" border=\"0\" width=\"300\" height=\"360\" style=\"text-align:right;\" align=\"right\">","<img src=\"grf/tsr_sm.png\" width=\"56\" height=\"59\" border=\"0\" alt=\"TSR\">"],"setting":"Dragon Magazine","statblock":{"Marrella":{"Activity Cycle":"Day","Alignment":"Neutral","Armor Class":"6,2 (head)","Climate/Terrain":"Shallow sea floor","Damage/Attack":"1d6/1d6","Diet":"Carnivore/Scavenger","Frequency":"Common","Hit Dice":"8","Intelligence":"Animal(1)","Magic Resistance":"Nil","Morale":"Average (10)","Movement":"12","No. Appearing":"2-24","No. of Attacks":"2","Organization":"Solitary","Size":"L (12' long)","Special Attacks":"Charge","Special Defenses":"Nil","THAC0":"13","Treasure":"Nil","XP Value":"975"}},"title":"Marrella"},"sources":["Dragon204"],"statblock_names":[],"title":"Marrella","prev_key":"leanchoi","next_key":"odongrip","catelog_book":"Dragon204","catelog_setting":"dr","monster_path":"/catalog/dr/Dragon204/marrella"}},"staticQueryHashes":[],"slicesMap":{}}
