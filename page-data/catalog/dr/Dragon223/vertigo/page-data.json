She functions as an 18th-level mage specializing in alteration magic. She dwells in a place of insanity located in multiple dimensions and accessed through a conduit located at an ancient stone circle.</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Combat:</b> In combat, Vertigo attacks with two claws, a deadly poison-laden bite, and a powerful tail slash. If she scores a successful bite, the opponent must save vs. poison (type E). A successful save results in 20 hp damage; a failed save means instant, painful death.</p><p>In addition to her mage spell powers, she also has a number of deadly spell-like powers accessable at will. They are a <a href=\"/appendix/scorpion\">scorpion</a> sting, gaze, and acid spittle.</p><p>For the scorpion sting, she can transform her tail into an adamantine spike with which to strike opponents. The tail hits for 3-30 hp damage. A Dexterity check allows an opponent to dive out of the way, but prevents him from being able to have initiative in the following round.</p><p>Her gaze can either <i>hypnotize</i> or <i>petrify</i>. For hypnosis, the range is 50', and she can affect up to 10 individuals, who must save vs. spells at -4. The petrification has a range of 20' and can affect up to three individuals whose save vs. petrification is at -3.</p><p>Up to 10 times per day, Vertigo can spit a globule of poisonous green acid up to 100' affecting an area with a radius of 20'. This acid causes 15d10 hp damage. A successful save vs. breath weapon will reduce the damage by half.</p><p>Vertigo can also <i>teleport</i> at will, with no error.</p><p>She is completely immune to acid, poison, and magical fire. Normal fire and lightning do only half damage.</p><p></p><p class=\"f\"><b>Habitat/Society:</b> Vertigo's worshippers consist of sorcerors and witches. When the Great Meteor hit the planet and the continents were re-arranged, some ancient stone circles still remained, and it is near one of these ancient magical vorteces that Vertigo founded her Urthly temple.</p><p>The evil cobrasaur sorceress then opened a planar conduit within the circle connecting her directly to her extradimensional \"Temple of Insanity.\"</p> <p></p><br clear=\"all\" style=\"clear:both; height:0;\">\r\n","images":["<img src=\"grf/dr.gif\" width=\"150\" height=\"75\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Dragon Magazine\" title=\"Dragon Magazine\" align=\"right\">","<img src=\"img/vertigo.gif\" alt=\"Vertigo\" title=\"Vertigo\" border=\"0\" width=\"300\" height=\"360\" style=\"text-align:right;\" align=\"right\">","<img src=\"grf/tsr_sm.png\" width=\"56\" height=\"59\" border=\"0\" alt=\"TSR\">"],"setting":"Dragon Magazine","statblock":{"Vertigo":{"Activity Cycle":"Day","Alignment":"Chaotic Evil","Armor Class":"-4","Climate/Terrain":"Any","Damage/Attack":"1-6/1-6/2-16/2-20","Diet":"Carnivore","Frequency":"Unique","Hit Dice":"18+12","Intelligence":"Genius (17-18)","Magic Resistance":"70%","Morale":"Champion (15-16)","Movement":"25","No. Appearing":"1","No. of Attacks":"4","Organization":"Solitary","Size":"L (28')","Special Attacks":"See below","Special Defenses":"See below","THAC0":"","Treasure":"H","XP Value":"17,000"}},"title":"Vertigo"},"sources":["Dragon223"],"statblock_names":[],"title":"Vertigo","prev_key":"talon","next_key":"blizzard","catelog_book":"Dragon223","catelog_setting":"dr","monster_path":"/catalog/dr/Dragon223/vertigo"}},"staticQueryHashes":[],"slicesMap":{}}
