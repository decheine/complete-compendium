These servants are utterly, mindlessly loyal to the overking.</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Combat:</b> Fiend knights have the same number of hit dice as they had levels when mortal fighters. For example, a 5th-level fighter would become a 5-HD fiend knight. Nearly all fiend knights are 10th level or below, with three exceptions - leaders of 11, 12, and 15 HD. These three leaders, and some dozen others, wear <i>fiend plate mail +3</i>. Others are 5% per level likely to wear magical plate mail (roll 1d10: 1-8 plate mail +1, 9 plate mail +2, 10 plate mail +3), else nonmagical plate mail. Fiend knights always employ two-handed weapons, usually two-handed swords, and composite long bows. Again, they are 5% per level likely to have magical weapons (use the table above, independently for each weapon type). Leaders are always armed with magical weapons, and the 11 + HD leaders all possess powerful ones: a <i>two-handed sword of cold +3</i> and a <i>two-handed sword +3, giant slayer</i>.</p><p>The fiend knights have high ability scores. All possess Strengths of 18/01 or better, and have minimum Dexterity and Constitution scores of 15. No ability ever has a score below 9.</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Habitat/Society:</b> The current composition of the fiend knights, in addition to their leaders, is approximately 80 cavalry, 20 of whom ride undead steeds, the other 60 riding normal <a href=\"/appendix/horse\">heavy warhorses</a>. Treat the undead steeds as heavy warhorses with immunity to <i>sleep</i>, <i>charm</i> and <i>hold</i> spells. These troops have heavy lances, again with a 5% chance per level for a magical lance, and they employ footman's flails in addition to two-handed weapons.</p><p>The 120 heavy infantry each carry a long spear and a variety of polearms in addition to other weaponry. They have a 2% chance per level for a magical polearm.</p><p>As currently organized, the fiend knights wear gold visors and bear a heraldic emblem etched on their armor over the heart. For cavalry, the emblem is a tan horse, and for infantry, it is a bronze baboon. The infantry are known as &ldquo;The Howlers&rdquo;, for when they go into combat they howl and scream, hoping to strike fear into the hearts of their enemies.</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Ecology:</b> Fiend knights are not undead, and have none of their weaknesses: they cannot be turned, harmed by holy water, and so on. They are simply wholly controlled humans loyal to Ivid, created by a precursor of the malign rituals that brought the <a href=\"/appendix/animus\">animus</a> to Oerth. The unfeeling, &ldquo;programmed&rdquo; nature of the fiend knights make them feared by all. Even Ivid's other troops hate and fear them, and loathe having to serve with them.</p><br clear=\"all\" style=\"clear:both; height:0;\">\r\n","images":["<img src=\"grf/gh.gif\" width=\"150\" height=\"75\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Greyhawk\" title=\"Greyhawk\" align=\"right\">","<img src=\"img/fienknig.gif\" alt=\"Fiend Knight\" title=\"Fiend Knight\" border=\"0\" width=\"300\" height=\"360\" style=\"text-align:right;\" align=\"right\">","<img src=\"grf/add2_01.gif\" width=\"200\" height=\"56\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Advanced Dungeons & Dragons 2nd Edition\">"],"setting":"Greyhawk","statblock":{"Fiend Knight":{"Activity Cycle":"Constant (do not need rest)","Alignment":"Any Evil","Armor Class":"10 (unarmored), see below","Climate/Terrain":"Any/Aerdy","Damage/Attack":"By weapon type +3 or better","Diet":"None","Frequency":"Special","Hit Dice":"4d10 to 10d10 ","Intelligence":"Very (11-12), rarely higher","Magic Resistance":"Nil","Morale":"Fearless (20)","Movement":"12, 24 mounted","No. Appearing":"Variable","No. of Attacks":"1","Organization":"Group","Size":"M (6'+)","Special Attacks":"Nil","Special Defenses":"Immune to sleep, charm, hold spells and illusion/phantasm spells below fourth level","THAC0":"Variable","Treasure":"Nil* (magic weapons and armour)","XP Value":"Variable"}},"title":"Fiend Knight"},"sources":["Dragon206"],"statblock_names":[],"title":"Fiend Knight","prev_key":"faerpebr","next_key":"browdobi","catelog_book":"Dragon206","catelog_setting":"dr","monster_path":"/catalog/dr/Dragon206/fienknig"}},"staticQueryHashes":[],"slicesMap":{}}
