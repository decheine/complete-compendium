For this reason, the jungle stirge is not an accomplished flier. Slower and clumsier in the air, the jungle stirge cannot sustain its flight for longer than a turn. The plumage of these monsters is a bright red, and their dangling beaks are a light yellowgreen. Their pincher-like feet are of similar color, with the hind legs much larger and stronger, assisting the creatures when they are roosting. If the DM uses the option of allowing a character to grapple with a jungle stirge, penalties should be applied to the Strength check or saving throw because of the beasts’ greater strength.</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Combat:</b> Jungle stirges attack as 4-Hit Die creatures with their long proboscis. A successful hit inflicts 1d4+1 hp damage, with automatic damage (also 1d4+1) from blood drain for every round the stirge remains attached. Jungle stirges are sated only after drinking 15 hp from their prey, after which they fly off to digest their meal.</p><p>The poison secreted from the proboscis of a stirge, while not deadly, is very dangerous. Immediately after being struck by the monster, the victim must save vs. poison. Those who make their saving throw are not out of the woods yet—the stirge continues to inject the toxin into its prey until the victim ceases struggling. The victim must save vs. poison each round at cumulative -2 penalty (-2 the second round, -4 the third round, etc.) until the stirge is killed, driven off, or the character has succumbed to the poison.</p><p>If the victim fails the save, he is paralyzed at the end of the following combat round and remains so for 2-12 hours. Once this time has elapsed, the victim may roll again for the save at no penalty. If the victim fails again, he remains paralyzed for an additional 2-12 hours. The victim remains paralyzed until he successfully saves against the poison or 24 hours have passed.</p><p>The poison of the jungle stirge is highly prized, particularly by jungle tribes. The poison is stored in two glandular sacs in the “jowls” of the creature, where the proboscis joins the head. Each sac yields between 2-12 doses of the poison, which remains viable as long as it is kept in the sacs at body temperature. The sacs, however, are difficult to locate and even harder to remove. The DM should select an appropriate skill or non-weapon proficiency to determine the success of sac removal. The poison must be injected into the blood stream to have its effect.</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Habitat/Society:</b> Jungle stirges live in colonies that rarely grow larger than 20 individuals. They do not hang like bats but build bird-like nests on ledges, in treetops, or in the ruins of thick rain forests.</p><p>These monsters are more fastidious than common stirges and defecate outside the nesting area, often near fallen victims after feeding. Thus, their nests are difficult to locate except by chance. Thus, little is known about their mating or nesting habits.</p><p>The stirges need a constant supply of blood and prey on the large animals of the jungle. Some native experts claim that only the female of the species requires blood, and that the male exists on fruit sap.</p><p>The largest concentration of jungle stirges have been found on the sites of ruined cities, which may host several colonies of the monsters. There have been no confirmed reports that jungle stirges have been raised in captivity, although their proclivity to ancient ruins suggests that in the past they may have been bred as guardians.</p><p>Though dangerous to small groups, jungle stirges are generally too far removed from civilized areas to be cause for great concern. It should be noted, however, that the beaks of this stirge are longer and sharper than their cousins and are able to puncture all but the finest crafted metal armors.</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Ecology:</b> Jungle stirges possess 240’ infravision and a highly developed sense of smell. These highly developed senses allow the monsters to locate creatures large enough to become prey soon after they enter the habitat. Creatures with a natural AC of 1 are immune to stirge attacks because of their thick hides. As noted above, leather armor will not protect a character from the penetrating attack of a jungle stirge. Full suits of plate mail or specially crafted metal armors that cover the entire body will give full protection. However, the creatures will be able to distinguish by smell those who are invulnerable to their attacks and will not waste time around these potentially dangerous foes.</p><p>Jungle stirges have a high metabolism and sleep only one day for every 3 hp of blood drained, for a maximum of five days. During this sluggish period, stealthy opponents gain the advantage of a -2 penalty to the monsters’ surprise roll. If the stirges are attacked after a full feeding (when more than half the colony drained 12-15 hp of blood each in the last 24 hours), their flight maneuverability class falls to E.</p><p>The colonies’ territory is much smaller than that of their cousins outside the jungles due to their poor propensity for flight. Ranges of the stirges are rarely more than half a mile in diameter. They do not move around, except to hunt, preferring to remain in their permanent roosting areas far above the jungle floor. The jungle stirges have only one natural enemy—the arboreal constrictors that share their treetops.</p><p>The presence of jungle stirges is difficult to detect, despite the smaller range. Their bloodless prey decay quickly in the moist jungle heat or are carried away by carrion eaters. Their nests are even more difficult to locate, although the few that have been discovered yielded a number of highly prized gems. Jewelry and other “pretty” treasures are carried back to the nest by the monsters, but no other treasure.</p><p></p><br clear=\"all\" style=\"clear:both; height:0;\">\r\n","images":["<img src=\"grf/dr.gif\" width=\"150\" height=\"75\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Dragon Magazine\" title=\"Dragon Magazine\" align=\"right\">","<img src=\"img/stirgeju.gif\" alt=\"Stirge, Jungle\" title=\"Stirge, Jungle\" border=\"0\" width=\"300\" height=\"360\" style=\"text-align:right;\" align=\"right\">","<img src=\"grf/tsr_sm.png\" width=\"56\" height=\"59\" border=\"0\" alt=\"TSR\">"],"setting":"Dragon Magazine","statblock":{"Stirge, Jungle":{"Activity Cycle":"Night","Alignment":"Nil","Armor Class":"7","Climate/Terrain":"Tropical, subterranean","Damage/Attack":"2-6","Diet":"Blood","Frequency":"Uncommon","Hit Dice":"2+1","Intelligence":"Animal (2)","Magic Resistance":"Nil","Morale":"Average (8-10)","Movement":"3, Fly 16 (D)","No. Appearing":"5-20","No. of Attacks":"1","Organization":"Colony","Size":"M (4’-5’)","Special Attacks":"Blood drain, poison","Special Defenses":"Nil","THAC0":"15","Treasure":"See below","XP Value":"420"}},"title":"Stirge, Jungle"},"sources":["Dragon239"],"statblock_names":[],"title":"Stirge, Jungle","prev_key":"stirgede","next_key":"boggart","catelog_book":"Dragon239","catelog_setting":"dr","monster_path":"/catalog/dr/Dragon239/stirgeju"}},"staticQueryHashes":[],"slicesMap":{}}
