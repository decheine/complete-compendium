There is always only one leshy per forest, and they can never go more than 100' from their domain, as they are tied to it as a <a href=\"/appendix/dryad\">dryad</a> is bound to her tree.</p><p>Leshies look comical, appearing as young elflike men in green and red clothes. Their coats are always buttoned wrong, and their shoes are always on the wrong feet.</p><p>A leshy's size depends on where he is in his forest. At the forest edge, he is tiny, merely 1' tall. In the forests center, he is as tall as a <a href=\"/appendix/gianhill\">hill giant</a> and has the Strength to match. In between, his size varies; the closer to the center, the bigger he is.</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Combat:</b> A leshy can blend in with his surroundings by standing perfectly still, effectively invisible. A druid or ranger has a 5% chance per level of spotting a leshy. It is impossible to surprise one.</p><p>Leshies do not normally carry weapons. They may, at their largest size, use tree trunks as clubs, inflicting double club damage plus the Strength bonus (2d6 + 7 hp damage). They may also, at this size, hurl rocks up to 200 yards for 2d8 hp damage, as a hill giant. They rarely use this attack, however, as they consider it barbaric.</p><p>Leshies have the spellcasting ability of a 12th-level druid. They prefer spells dealing with plants. They can also call woodland beings once a day, calling creatures who fight to the best of their ability. Also, no good- or neutral-aligned forest creature will ever harm a leshy.</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Habitat/Society:</b> Leshies are protectors who act in maintenance and defense of their forests at all costs. A leshy will die if his forest is destroyed (a rare event, as they inhabit only the largest of forests).</p><p>Leshies know every detail of the forest they inhabit and may make excellent guides if they can be persuaded. Leshies help only good creatures and drive away any evil ones.</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Ecology:</b> Leshies can live to be 1,000 years old, retaining a youthful appearance throughout their lives. If one dies, a new one appears by some unknown occurrence.</p><p>Leshies are vegetarians, subsisting primarily on berries, fruit, roots, and tubers.</p><p>Gold and silver have no value to leshies, but they often keep small amounts of wealth to use for bartering purposes.</p>\n","images":["<img src=\"grf/dr.gif\" width=\"150\" height=\"75\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Dragon Magazine\" title=\"Dragon Magazine\" align=\"right\">","<img src=\"img/leshy.gif\" alt=\"Leshy\" title=\"Leshy\" border=\"0\" width=\"300\" height=\"360\" style=\"text-align:right;\" align=\"right\">","<img src=\"grf/add2_01.gif\" width=\"200\" height=\"56\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Advanced Dungeons & Dragons 2nd Edition\">"],"setting":"Dragon Magazine","statblock":{"Leshy":{"Activity Cycle":"Day","Alignment":"Neutral good","Armor Class":"5","Climate/Terrain":"Any large forest","Damage/Attack":"By weapon + possible Str bonus","Diet":"Herbivore","Frequency":"Rare","Hit Dice":"8","Intelligence":"Genius (17-18)","Magic Resistance":"40%","Morale":"","Movement":"12","No. Appearing":"1","No. of Attacks":"1","Organization":"Solitary","Size":"-15","Special Attacks":"Spells","Special Defenses":"Spells","THAC0":"12","Treasure":"M (&times;10)","XP Value":""}},"title":"Leshy"},"sources":["Dragon239"],"statblock_names":[],"title":"Leshy","prev_key":"leprwick","next_key":"stirgede","catelog_book":"Dragon239","catelog_setting":"dr","monster_path":"/catalog/dr/Dragon239/leshy"}},"staticQueryHashes":[],"slicesMap":{}}
