However, it has the ability to change color to match any metallic or earth hue; its natural color seems to be slate gray, but this is by no means certain. A long worm with a leechlike mouth, it is one of the few terrestrial predators that preys on creatures from the Elemental Plane of Earth. Unlike its surface-dwelling relative, it is only 5 to 6 feet in diameter.</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Combat:</b> After attracting prey by giving itself the color of gold, silver, platinum, or anolher precious metal, the glitterworrn first employs its breath weapon, squirting a jet of acid all over its foe and inflicting 3-30 points of damage, or half that if a saving throw vs. breath weapon is successful. (This acid jet extends to 70 feet and is a uniform 5 feet wide.) Then, as the worm lunges forward, its great leechlike, acid-beslobbered jaws fasten upon the prey, causing 2- 20 points of damage each round the glitterworm remains attached. The acid flows freely even after the initial attack, requiring victims to make saving throws for worn or carried items as well. The glitterworm's leechlike grip cannot be broken uless a successful Strength roll is made (at a -1 penalty). Because of its specialized attack and, and the nature of its toughest prey, this creature is immune both to acids and to all earth-based attacks.</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Habitat/Society:</b> Glitterworms are solitary predators, coming together only during the mating season. A couple will meet, intertwine for an hour, then go their separate ways. The female lays a single egg: a lustrous shiny gray orb that is completely inedible to all terrestrial creatures. Creatures of elemental earth can eat it, however, which is another reason why glitterworms go out of their way to destroy such predators. Aside from this, no special care is taken with the egg, and indeed, none is necessary.</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Ecology:</b> The glilterworm is the ultimate omnivore, eating not only flesh and vegetation but minerals as well. Indeed, its ability to devour elemental earth is almost certainly an outgrowth of its tendency to eat normal stone. <a href=\"/appendix/xorn\">Xorn</a> are favorite targets, and a glitterworm will pass up other prey if a xorn is in the area. <a href=\"/appendix/dwarf\">Dwarves</a>, <a href=\"/appendix/gnome\">gnomes</a>, and other demihumans or humans who delve underground are also regarded as choice fare. It is to attract these two favorite foods that the glitterworm evolved the ability to change colors and odors to look and smell like any type of precious metal, including such rare ones as mithral and adamnntite. The intended prey sees what looks like a narrow vein of rare ore, rushes up to start eating or mining it, and receives quite a rude surprise!</p><p>Because of various unsavory changes in its metabolism in the course of its evolution, the glitterworm has no natural enemies except on the Elemental Plane of Earth, and even creatures from that plane are more likely to be prey than predators. However, adventurers and evil wizards being what they are, there are many attempts made on these creatures, either to kill them or capture their 3'-diameter eggs to raise guardian beasts. Since a glitterworm can bite into and digest anything with its acidic jaws, it can literally eat its way out of any enclosure not protected by magic. However, fools keep on trying, as a sizeable number of reckless or power-mad wizards are willing to pay 5,000 gp for a Single egg. The creature's acid is also much in demand by alchemists. A single vial of the stuff can sell for up to 100 gp.</p>\n","images":["<img src=\"grf/dm.gif\" width=\"150\" height=\"75\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Dragon Magazine\" title=\"Dragon Magazine\" align=\"right\">","<img src=\"img/glitworm.gif\" alt=\"Glitterworm\" title=\"Glitterworm\" border=\"0\" width=\"300\" height=\"360\" style=\"text-align:right;\" align=\"right\">","<img src=\"grf/tsr_sm.png\" width=\"56\" height=\"59\" border=\"0\" alt=\"TSR\">"],"setting":"Dragon Magazine","statblock":{"Glitterworm":{"Activity Cycle":"Any","Alignment":"Neutral","Armor Class":"-1","Climate/Terrain":"Subterranean","Damage/Attack":"2-20","Diet":"Omnivore (see below)","Frequency":"Very rare","Hit Dice":"18","Intelligence":"Animal (1)","Magic Resistance":"Nil","Morale":"Fearless (19)","Movement":"12","No. Appearing":"1","No. of Attacks":"1","Organization":"Solitary","Size":"G (30' k~ng)","Special Attacks":"Acid jet, camouflage","Special Defenses":"Immunity to acid, earth-based attacks","THAC0":"5","Treasure":"Nil","XP Value":"16,000"}},"title":"Glitterworm"},"sources":["Dragon267"],"statblock_names":[],"title":"Glitterworm","prev_key":"catfstal","next_key":"tunmoudw","catelog_book":"Dragon267","catelog_setting":"dr","monster_path":"/catalog/dr/Dragon267/glitworm"}},"staticQueryHashes":[],"slicesMap":{}}
