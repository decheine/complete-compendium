The first form is that of a small <a href=\"/appendix/whale\">whale</a> with a long unicorn's horn, the second is that of a sea horse with the same horn, and the third is that of a <a href=\"/appendix/unicorn\">unicorn</a> with a blue-white coloration. In all three forms, the unicorn's eyes are deep blue. It takes one round for it to change shape, during which time it cannot attack; all shape-changing must be done while submerged in water.</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Combat:</b> Aside from being able to switch between its three forms at will, a sea unicorn or narwhal can breathe water in any form. The last form allows the unicorn to breathe air. Narwals can <i>control weather</i> (as per the cleric spell) once per day at the 11th level of ability. The last form can also walk on water at will at normal ground speed.</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Habitat/Society:</b> Sea unicorns can be found in any body of water larger than a large lake. They are very ordered creatures who carefully cultivate kelp beds to graze on. They generally stay out of conflicts. Narwhals mate for life and have very carefully mapped-out territories. Narwhals can be ridden by <a href=\"/appendix/elfaquat\">sea-elven</a> (see also <a href=\"/appendix/elfseada\">Dargonesti</a> and <a href=\"/appendix/elfseadi\">Dimernesti</a>) maidens\nof pure heart.</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Ecology:</b> Narwhals feed on the kelp beds that they carefully cultivate. A narwhal's horn can be used to brew <i>potions of water breathing</i>.</p>\n","images":["<img src=\"grf/dr.gif\" width=\"150\" height=\"75\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Dragon Magazine\" title=\"Dragon Magazine\" align=\"right\">","<img src=\"grf/add2_01.gif\" width=\"200\" height=\"56\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Advanced Dungeons & Dragons 2nd Edition\">"],"setting":"Dragon Magazine","statblock":{"Unicorn, Sea":{"Activity Cycle":"Any","Alignment":"Lawful neutral","Armor Class":"4","Climate/Terrain":"Temperate/Oceans","Damage/Attack":"1-6/1-6/1-12 or 2-16","Diet":"Herbivore","Frequency":"Very rare","Hit Dice":"3+4","Intelligence":"Very (11-12)","Magic Resistance":"Nil","Morale":"Steady (11-12)","Movement":"24, Sw 36","No. Appearing":"1-6","No. of Attacks":"3 or 1","Organization":"Family","Size":"L","Special Attacks":"See below","Special Defenses":"See below","THAC0":"17","Treasure":"Nil","XP Value":"650"}},"title":"Unicorn, Sea"},"sources":["Dragon190"],"statblock_names":[],"title":"Unicorn, Sea","prev_key":"unicpint","next_key":"unicunis","catelog_book":"Dragon190","catelog_setting":"dr","monster_path":"/catalog/dr/Dragon190/unicsea"}},"staticQueryHashes":[],"slicesMap":{}}
