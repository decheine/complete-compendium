They usually have doe-brown eyes.</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Combat:</b> A zebracorn can cast a <i>color spray</i> from its horn three times per day. It can also <i>polymorph</i> itself into any creature three times a day at will; this power is treated as if it were a <i>polymorph self</i> spell cast at the 11th-level of ability.</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Habitat/Society:</b> Zebracorns live in equatorial savannahs. Each herd generally contains one stallion and several mares. Being nomadic, they roam the savannah so that no one area becomes overgrazed. A zebracorn can be ridden by any being who proves itself friendly, though they can <i>detect evil</i> by touch and will immediately attack evil beings. They are unpredictable and willful (some say pig-headed).</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Ecology:</b> Zebracorns eat the coarse dry grass of the savannah. They generally stay out of fights that don't concern them, but one never knows what a zebracorn will do. The horn of a zebracorn can be used to brew potions of <i>polymorph self</i>. When in polymorphed form, a zebracorn generally takes the form of a muscular, hairless, black human with a warrior's bearing. Though the human-zebracorn carries no weapons, he or she can easily use any weapon it has ever seen a human use.</p><p></p><br clear=\"all\" style=\"clear:both; height:0;\">\r\n","images":["<img src=\"grf/dr.gif\" width=\"150\" height=\"75\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Dragon Magazine\" title=\"Dragon Magazine\" align=\"right\">","<img src=\"grf/add2_01.gif\" width=\"200\" height=\"56\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Advanced Dungeons & Dragons 2nd Edition\">"],"setting":"Dragon Magazine","statblock":{"Unicorn, Zebracorn":{"Activity Cycle":"Day","Alignment":"Neutral","Armor Class":"2","Climate/Terrain":"Tropical/Savannah","Damage/Attack":"1-6/1-6/1-12","Diet":"Herbivore","Frequency":"Very rare","Hit Dice":"4+4","Intelligence":"Average (8-10)","Magic Resistance":"Nil","Morale":"Elite (13-14)","Movement":"24","No. Appearing":"1-10","No. of Attacks":"3","Organization":"Herd","Size":"L","Special Attacks":"See below","Special Defenses":"See below","THAC0":"17","Treasure":"Nil","XP Value":"975"}},"title":"Unicorn, Zebracorn"},"sources":["Dragon190"],"statblock_names":[],"title":"Unicorn, Zebracorn","prev_key":"unicunis","next_key":"wormtugi","catelog_book":"Dragon190","catelog_setting":"dr","monster_path":"/catalog/dr/Dragon190/uniczebr"}},"staticQueryHashes":[],"slicesMap":{}}
