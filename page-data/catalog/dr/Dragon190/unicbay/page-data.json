These spells are cast at the 11th level, with spell effects generally emanating from the horn. Bay unicorns are immune to the effects of fire, heat, and smoke, either magical or mundane.</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Habitat/Society:</b> Bay unicorns mate once per year, then go their separate ways. The young are protected by their mother until they are six months old, then are left to fend for themselves.</p><p>Bay unicorns make their homes in underground labyrinths, caverns, dungeon complexes, mines, and volcanic tunnel passages that do not go deeper than a few hundred feet. They feed upon the fungi and small creatures that can be found in underground areas. They mark the walls of their subterranean territory in the same way that sylvan unicorns mark trees in their forests. Rangers may be confused to find a unicorn's mark deep beneath the earth, but they will be even more surprised to find that the unicorn in question is both evil and omnivorous. Pyrocorns can be ridden by exceptionally evil females who have an affinity for fire magic or who worship a god of fire.</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Ecology:</b> The horn of a bay unicorn can be used to create <i>potions of fire breath</i>. They ferociously attack any trespassers they find in their domains, yet they will not descend into the depths.</p><br clear=\"all\" style=\"clear:both; height:0;\">\r\n","images":["<img src=\"grf/dr.gif\" width=\"150\" height=\"75\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Dragon Magazine\" title=\"Dragon Magazine\" align=\"right\">","<img src=\"grf/add2_01.gif\" width=\"200\" height=\"56\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Advanced Dungeons & Dragons 2nd Edition\">"],"setting":"Dragon Magazine","statblock":{"Unicorn, Bay":{"Activity Cycle":"Any","Alignment":"Neutral evil","Armor Class":"1","Climate/Terrain":"Any/Subterranean","Damage/Attack":"1-6/1-6/1-12","Diet":"Omnivore","Frequency":"Rare","Hit Dice":"6+4","Intelligence":"Low (5-7)","Magic Resistance":"Nil","Morale":"Steady (11-12)","Movement":"18","No. Appearing":"1","No. of Attacks":"3","Organization":"Solitary","Size":"L","Special Attacks":"See below","Special Defenses":"See below","THAC0":"15","Treasure":"U","XP Value":"2,000"}},"title":"Unicorn, Bay"},"sources":["Dragon#190"],"statblock_names":[],"title":"Unicorn, Bay","prev_key":"unicalic","next_key":"unicbla2","catelog_book":"Dragon190","catelog_setting":"dr","monster_path":"/catalog/dr/Dragon190/unicbay"}},"staticQueryHashes":[],"slicesMap":{}}
