Generally, it looks like a giant <a href=\"/appendix/crocodil\">crocodile</a> about 60' long, with either flippers instead of legs or legs with webbed feet. The eyes are prominent, and, in some cases, its tail may end in a fishlike fin. Its grayish or reddish brown skin looks smooth, but scales still remain in some places, forming rings around the body and creating a slight dorsal crest. It is found all over the tropics, and prefers the open sea to the coast.</p><p>Given the varying descriptions, more than one species of animal could be involved here. Those with flippers could well be <a href=\"/appendix/dinoaqua\">mosasaurs</a> (detailed in MC3) though they could just as easily be plesiosaurs (short-necked plesiosaurs, such as the Kronosaurus from Australian waters) that should have the same general stats. The web-footed crocs could be surviving Thalattosuchians, or sea crocodiles from the Mesozoic Era. They would differ from the standard giant crocodile in the following ways: NO. APPEARING: 1-2; no land movement, SW 18; HD 14; THAC0 7; #ATT: 1 (bite); DAMAGE/ATTACK: 7-28; SPECIAL ATTACKS: Swallow whole; SIZE G (60'); XP VALUE: 8,000.</p><br><p><i>by Gregory W.
