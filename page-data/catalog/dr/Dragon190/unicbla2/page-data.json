They are sometimes called <a href=\"/appendix/nightmar\">nightmares</a>, causing confusion with the outer-planes monster.</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Combat:</b> Because of the magical nature of <a href=\"/appendix/unicblac\">black unicorns</a>, they can see perfectly out to 300' in the absence of all light, even in the area of effect of a <i>darkness</i> spell. Black unicorns cannot well stand any light and thus have a -1 to saving throws against effects that blind or dazzle the eyes. They suffer a -4 to all attack rolls in daylight, being effectively blinded.</p><p>Black unicorns continually radiate a <i>silence, 15' radius</i> effect. They can cast <i>darkness, 15' radius</i> and <i>invisibility</i> spells on themselves, three times each per day. Black unicorns can <i>teleport</i> in a manner similar to sylvan and other unicorns, but they can only do so in the dark (e.g., on moonless nights or in deep shadows, in unlit rooms, or in <i>darkness</i> spells).</p><p>The horn of a black unicorn is poisonous; anyone struck by it must make a saving throw vs. poison or be paralyzed. The paralysis lasts for three days; if the poison is not neutralized by the third day, the victim dies of heart failure.</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Habitat/Society:</b> Black unicorns have loose family habits similar to the <a href=\"/appendix/unicbay\">pyrocorns'</a>. They do not mark out any particular territory but continually wander from place to place (often invisibly) causing havoc. They may be ridden by exceptionally evil fighters or thieves of either sex.</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Ecology:</b> These monsters are extremely evil and have sharp canine teeth. They are carnivorous creatures who prefer to eat their meat while it is still alive. A black unicorn's horn can be used to brew extremely virulent poisons that kill their imbibers within one round if a saving throw vs. poison is failed or cause paralysis for 1-3 hours if the save is successful.</p><br clear=\"all\" style=\"clear:both; height:0;\">\r\n","images":["<img src=\"grf/dr.gif\" width=\"150\" height=\"75\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Dragon Magazine\" title=\"Dragon Magazine\" align=\"right\">","<img src=\"grf/add2_01.gif\" width=\"200\" height=\"56\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Advanced Dungeons & Dragons 2nd Edition\">"],"setting":"Dragon Magazine","statblock":{"Unicorn, Black":{"Activity Cycle":"Night","Alignment":"Chaotic evil","Armor Class":"2","Climate/Terrain":"Any","Damage/Attack":"1-8/1-8/2-16","Diet":"Carnivore","Frequency":"Rare","Hit Dice":"6+4","Intelligence":"Average (8-10)","Magic Resistance":"30%","Morale":"Champion (15-16)","Movement":"24","No. Appearing":"1","No. of Attacks":"3","Organization":"Solitary","Size":"L","Special Attacks":"See below","Special Defenses":"See below","THAC0":"15","Treasure":"Nil","XP Value":"6,000"}},"title":"Unicorn, Black"},"sources":["Dragon#190"],"statblock_names":[],"title":"Unicorn, Black","prev_key":"unicbay","next_key":"unicbrow","catelog_book":"Dragon190","catelog_setting":"dr"}},"staticQueryHashes":[],"slicesMap":{}}
