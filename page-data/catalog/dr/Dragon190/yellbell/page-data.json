Its tail is extremely long and tapering. The Yellow belly is a very striking shade of yellow in color, with a black stripe all along its spine and black transverse bands on its sides. It has only been reported in tropical waters. Because its description is so vague, there is, as yet, no way to make even an educated guess about what kind of animal it is (if it exists at all). Use the statistics of common <a href=\"/appendix/whale\">whales</a> with maximum hit dice, doing damage only with a bite that does 3d4x5 points of damage.</p><br><p><i>by Gregory W.
