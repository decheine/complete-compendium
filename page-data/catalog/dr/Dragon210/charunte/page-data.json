They look like winged humanoids with the nose of a vulture, pointed animal ears, and snakes instead of hair. They have come back from the dead to harvest victims for their evil masters.</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Combat:</b> Charuntes attack using +2 two-handed hammers. They wear full plate armor +2. The snakes in their hair also attack once per round. Any victim bitten by a snake must save versus poison or die in 2-12 turns.</p><p>Charuntes also have clerical spells appropriate for the level they held in life. A priest must reach at least 9th level to come back from the dead as a charuntes. Otherwise, they could be of any level up to level 29. Note that the XP-Value of a charuntes depends on its level. Hence, several values are given.</p><p>The THAC0 of a charuntes will also vary by level. Taking into account the +2 weapon, the THAC0 for various levels is: 9th = 14, 10-12th = 12, 13-15th = 10, 16-18th = 8, and 19th + = 6. If a DM allows a charuntes magical weapons greater than +2, or a high Strength score, she should adjust the THAC0 accordingly.</p><p>The following spells or attack forms have no effect on charuntes: <i>charm</i>, <i>sleep</i>, <i>hold</i>, <i>enfeeblement</i>, <i>paralysis</i>, <i>polymorph</i>, cold, electricity, insanity, or death spells or symbols (including any poisons).</p><p>A cleric has the same chance to turn a charuntes as she does a <a href=\"/appendix/lich\">lich</a>.</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Habitat/Society:</b> As undead, charuntes have no real society. They do, however, still retain an affinity for attacking in a group. If only one charuntes is encountered, he will be guarded by two <a href=\"/appendix/skelwarr\">skeleton warriors</a>. While charuntes can be encountered anywhere, they are most likely to be found in spots that death gods would consider holy. Such spots include: tombs, graveyards, ruined temples, altars to a death deity, battlefields, death-cairns, and burial vaults or mounds.</p><br clear=\"all\" style=\"clear:both; height:0;\">\r\n","images":["<img src=\"grf/dr.gif\" width=\"150\" height=\"75\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Dragon Magazine\" title=\"Dragon Magazine\" align=\"right\">","<img src=\"grf/add2_01.gif\" width=\"200\" height=\"56\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Advanced Dungeons & Dragons 2nd Edition\">"],"setting":"Dragon Magazine","statblock":{"Charuntes":{"Activity Cycle":"n/a","Alignment":"Neutral evil","Armor Class":"0*","Climate/Terrain":"Any","Damage/Attack":"2-8+2*/1-4 + poison","Diet":"n/a","Frequency":"Very rare","Hit Dice":"9+*","Intelligence":"Very to exceptional (11-16)","Magic Resistance":"Nil","Morale":"Fearless (20)","Movement":"9, Fl 18","No. Appearing":"1-4","No. of Attacks":"1 hammer/1 snake","Organization":"Roving bands","Size":"M","Special Attacks":"Clerical spells","Special Defenses":"+ 1 weapon to hit","THAC0":"See below","Treasure":"Nil","XP Value":"9th = 7,000<br>10th = 8,000<br>11th = 9,000 etc."}},"title":"Charuntes"},"sources":["Dragon210"],"statblock_names":[],"title":"Charuntes","prev_key":"charunte","catelog_book":"Dragon210","catelog_setting":"dr","monster_path":"/catalog/dr/Dragon210/charunte"}},"staticQueryHashes":[],"slicesMap":{}}
