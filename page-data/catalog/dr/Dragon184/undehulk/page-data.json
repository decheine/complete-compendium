The creature is formed from the remains of dead <a href=\"/appendix/umbehulk\">umber hulks</a> and to all appearances seems to be nothing more than a typical monster <a href=\"/appendix/zombie\">zombie</a>. An undead hulk reeks of death, and its undead nature is obvious to anyone within 10' of it. Other than its obviously unliving state, the undead hulk appears as any other umber hulk.</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Combat:</b> An undead hulk attacks in much the same way as a typical umber hulk: with brute force. However, the undead hulk is totally mindless and incapable of forming any strategy or tactics. It only obeys its master, to the best of its abilities and heedless of any danger to itself.</p><p>In addition to normal attacks of two claws and a vicious bite, undead hulks can bear-hug any opponent of any size smaller than themselves. This requires two successful claw attacks, which do no damage. Success indicates the victim is crushed against the undead hulks massive frame and suffers 6d4 hp damage each subsequent round, with no attack roll required. The undead hulk cannot bite a trapped opponent, nor can it attack any other being while hugging a foe. Unlike the monsters they resemble, undead hulks no longer possess the <i>confusion</i> generating power of their magical eyes.</p><p>An undead hulk can be turned by a cleric as a special undead.</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Habitat/Society:</b> Undead hulks are under the absolute control of their creator and have no culture of their own. They serve their \"small lords\" without question. Undead hulks are created through a bizarre magical ritual developed by the neogi (the details of which are left up to the DM) and the magical joining of dead umber hulk parts. Each part (head, right arm, right leg, etc.) must come from a different umber hulk.</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Ecology:</b> Undead hulks are magical constructs and play no role in an ecology. They simply exist, doing the bidding of their masters, until they are destroyed.</p>\n","images":["<img src=\"grf/dm.gif\" width=\"150\" height=\"75\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Dragon Magazine\" title=\"Dragon Magazine\" align=\"right\">","<img src=\"img/undehulk.gif\" alt=\"Undead Hulk\" title=\"Undead Hulk\" border=\"0\" width=\"300\" height=\"360\" style=\"text-align:right;\" align=\"right\">","<img src=\"grf/tsr_sm.png\" width=\"56\" height=\"59\" border=\"0\" alt=\"TSR\">"],"setting":"Dragon Magazine","statblock":{"Undead Hulk":{"Activity Cycle":"Any","Alignment":"N","Armor Class":"4","Climate/Terrain":"Any neogi enclave","Damage/Attack":"3d4/3d4/1d10","Diet":"Nil","Frequency":"Very rare","Hit Dice":"10","Intelligence":"Non-","Magic Resistance":"10%","Morale":"Fearless (20)","Movement":"6, Br 6","No. Appearing":"1-4","No. of Attacks":"3 + special","Organization":"Solitary","Size":"L (8' tall, 5' wide)","Special Attacks":"See below","Special Defenses":"Nil","THAC0":"11","Treasure":"Nil","XP Value":"4,000"}},"title":"Undead Hulk"},"sources":["Dragon184"],"statblock_names":[],"title":"Undead Hulk","prev_key":"undehulk","catelog_book":"Dragon184","catelog_setting":"dr","monster_path":"/catalog/dr/Dragon184/undehulk"}},"staticQueryHashes":[],"slicesMap":{}}
