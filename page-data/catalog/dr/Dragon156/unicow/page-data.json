Like the <a href=\"/appendix/unicorn\">unicorn</a>, it can be tamed by a maiden pure of heart, though she must be of neutral alignment and probably not very bright. These “milkmaids” (or “cowgirls”) care for their unicows with great love and diligence right up to the day they sell their unicows to the Elven Stockyards for meatloaf.</p><p>Each unicow has one blue horn in the center of its forehead that can strike for 2-20 hp damage with a +2 bonus on to-hit rolls if the beast charges 30’ or more before striking its opponent. Coloration is usually white with black patches.</p><p>This creature saves as a 7th-level wizard, cannot be <i>charmed</i> or <i>held</i> by magic, and is unaffected by death spells. Its milk gives any drinker a +2 bonus to constitution for 2-5 hours.</p><p>Unicows (unicattle?) speak their own language, though their conversations are rather narrowly restricted to discussions of grass quality. No one has any clue as to how or why these creatures exist. Your editors are not making any judgments, either.</p><p></p><p><i>Created by: Sharon Jenkins</i></p><p></p><br clear=\"all\" style=\"clear:both; height:0;\">\r\n","images":["<img src=\"grf/dr.gif\" width=\"150\" height=\"75\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Dragon Magazine\" title=\"Dragon Magazine\" align=\"right\">","<img src=\"img/unicow.gif\" alt=\"Unicow\" title=\"Unicow\" border=\"0\" width=\"300\" height=\"360\" style=\"text-align:right;\" align=\"right\">","<img src=\"grf/tsr_sm.png\" width=\"56\" height=\"59\" border=\"0\" alt=\"TSR\">"],"setting":"Dragon Magazine","statblock":{"Unicow":{"Activity Cycle":"Day","Alignment":"Neutral","Armor Class":"2","Climate/Terrain":"Temperate grasslands, like Wisconsin","Damage/Attack":"1-4/1-4/1-10","Diet":"Herbivore","Frequency":"Medium rare","Hit Dice":"3 +2","Intelligence":"Average","Magic Resistance":"Standard","Morale":"Average (10)","Movement":"12","No. Appearing":"1-10","No. of Attacks":"3 (hoof/hoof/horn)","Organization":"Herd","Size":"L (5’ tall at shoulder)","Special Attacks":"Charge","Special Defenses":"Immune to certain spells","THAC0":"27","Treasure":"X","XP Value":"420"}},"title":"Unicow"},"sources":["Dragon156"],"statblock_names":[],"title":"Unicow","prev_key":"tickler","next_key":"werehare","catelog_book":"Dragon156","catelog_setting":"dr","monster_path":"/catalog/dr/Dragon156/unicow"}},"staticQueryHashes":[],"slicesMap":{}}
