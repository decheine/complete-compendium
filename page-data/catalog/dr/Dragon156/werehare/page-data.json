In were-form, it can attack with a onehanded weapon for normal damage. This creature has a mean streak a mile wide, and passes up no opportunity to prove how awful it can be, though it is not particularly brave and so rarely carries out its plans.</p><p>This creature can be hit by only silver or magical weapons, including Holy Hand Grenades.</p><p></p><p><i>Created by: Sharon Jenkins</i></p><p></p><br clear=\"all\" style=\"clear:both; height:0;\">\r\n","images":["<img src=\"grf/dr.gif\" width=\"150\" height=\"75\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Dragon Magazine\" title=\"Dragon Magazine\" align=\"right\">","<img src=\"img/MONSTER_KEY.gif\" alt=\"Werelagomorph (Were-hare)\" title=\"Werelagomorph (Were-hare)\" border=\"0\" width=\"300\" height=\"360\" style=\"text-align:right;\" align=\"right\">","<img src=\"grf/tsr_sm.png\" width=\"56\" height=\"59\" border=\"0\" alt=\"TSR\">"],"setting":"Dragon Magazine","statblock":{"Werelagomorph (Were-hare)":{"Activity Cycle":"Any","Alignment":"Chaotic evil","Armor Class":"4 in hare form, 6 in werehare form","Climate/Terrain":"Temperate climes, underground","Damage/Attack":"1/1/1 -4 or by weapon type (were-hare form only)","Diet":"Herbivore (kills out of meanness)","Frequency":"Not rare enough","Hit Dice":"3 (24 hp in were-hare form, 3 hp in hare form)","Intelligence":"Low","Magic Resistance":"Standard","Morale":"Unsteady (5)","Movement":"24 in hare form, 12 in werehare form","No. Appearing":"1-8","No. of Attacks":"3 (claw/claw/nibble) or 1 (weapon) in were-hare form, nil in hare form","Organization":"Herd, if that is the right word for a bunch of rabbits","Size":"S (2 ’ long in hare form) to M (4½ ’ tall in were-hare form)","Special Attacks":"Diseased bite (lycanthropy)","Special Defenses":"Struck only by silver or magical weapons","THAC0":"17","Treasure":"Nil","XP Value":"175"}},"title":"Werelagomorph (Were-hare)"},"sources":["Dragon156"],"statblock_names":[],"title":"Werelagomorph (Were-hare)","prev_key":"unicow","next_key":"woomambl","catelog_book":"Dragon156","catelog_setting":"dr","monster_path":"/catalog/dr/Dragon156/werehare"}},"staticQueryHashes":[],"slicesMap":{}}
