They will blink on a roll of 5 or better on 1d12, with a range of up to 60', and will reappear as per a 1d12 roll: 1 = in front of opponent; 2 = shield (or left) front flank; 3 = unshielded (or right) front flank; 4-8 = behind opponent; 9-12 = on top of opponent. If a blink mammoth appears directly above its opponent, the victim is crushed for 6-36 hp damage. All of his equipment must save vs. crushing blow, and the victim must save vs. wands to avoid being knocked unconscious for 2-12 rounds. Only one blink mammoth will &ldquo;drop in on&rdquo; a victim at a time. Additionally, any victim so struck must make a dexterity check on 4d6 to avoid being knocked down, thus giving the blink mammoths a +2 to-hit bonus if the victim fails to get initiative to stand up.</p><p>The heavy tusks of these mammoths have 150% of the weight and value of elephants' tusks, being worth 1d6 &times; 150 gp each, or about 6 gp per pound. Getting the tusks, of course, is a problem.</p><p><br></p><p class=\"ni\"><i>Created by: Sharon Jenkins</i></p><br clear=\"all\" style=\"clear:both; height:0;\">\r\n","images":["<img src=\"grf/dr.gif\" width=\"150\" height=\"75\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Dragon Magazine\" title=\"Dragon Magazine\" align=\"right\">","<img src=\"img/woomambl.gif\" alt=\"Wooly Mammoth, Blink\" title=\"Wooly Mammoth, Blink\" border=\"0\" width=\"300\" height=\"360\" style=\"text-align:right;\" align=\"right\">","<img src=\"grf/add2_01.gif\" width=\"200\" height=\"56\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Advanced Dungeons & Dragons 2nd Edition\">"],"setting":"Dragon Magazine","statblock":{"Wooly Mammoth, Blink":{"Activity Cycle":"Day","Alignment":"Neutral","Armor Class":"5","Climate/Terrain":"Subarctic/Plains","Damage/Attack":"2-16/2-16/2-12/2-12-12","Diet":"Herbivore","Frequency":"Very rare","Hit Dice":"15","Intelligence":"Semi- (2-4)","Magic Resistance":"Nil","Morale":"Elite (14)","Movement":"12","No. Appearing":"1-12","No. of Attacks":"5 (2 tusks, 1 trunk constriction, 2 forefeet)","Organization":"Herd","Size":"L (14' tall at shoulder)","Special Attacks":"Blinking","Special Defenses":"Nil","THAC0":"5","Treasure":"Tusks (good luck!)","XP Value":"12,000"}},"title":"Wooly Mammoth, Blink"},"sources":["Dragon156"],"statblock_names":[],"title":"Wooly Mammoth, Blink","prev_key":"werehare","next_key":"behirvar","catelog_book":"Dragon156","catelog_setting":"dr","monster_path":"/catalog/dr/Dragon156/woomambl"}},"staticQueryHashes":[],"slicesMap":{}}
