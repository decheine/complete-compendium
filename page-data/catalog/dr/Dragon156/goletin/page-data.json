The cost of construction is 1,000 gp per hit point and two months' construction time.</p><p>The tin golem remains under the control of its wizard creator. It obeys any simple commands and remains motionless indefinitely until called forth. The wizard can optionally &ldquo;program&rdquo; it with a command word for use by others, but the commands of the wizard override any others.</p><p>Tin golems can be struck by any weapon, but edged or pointed weapons must save vs. crushing blow or else be bent or dulled ( -2 to hit and damage); each magical &ldquo;plus&rdquo; gives the weapon a saving-throw bonus. In addition, all edged and pointed weapons do only half damage to a tin golem. Crushing weapons do full damage unless they are made of wood or bone, in which case they do half damage.</p><p>Tin golems are immune to cold- and firebased attacks; electricity ricochets off them, but acid does full damage. Gas and magic missiles do not affect them, nor does any spell that affects living things (e.g., <i>hold</i>, <i>charm</i>, <i>hypnotism</i>, etc.).</p><p>Tin golems appear to be toylike caricatures of mankind, dressed in red coattails and with tall blue or black hats with matching high boots. Most have white baldrics with white pants tucked into their boots. All carry huge sabres. The outfit is considered to be traditional (its origin is unknown) and does not appear to affect the performance of the golem, which is also called a tin soldier.</p><p><br></p><p><i>Created by: Scott Wile</i></p><br clear=\"all\" style=\"clear:both; height:0;\">\r\n","images":["<img src=\"grf/dr.gif\" width=\"150\" height=\"75\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Dragon Magazine\" title=\"Dragon Magazine\" align=\"right\">","<img src=\"grf/add2_01.gif\" width=\"200\" height=\"56\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Advanced Dungeons & Dragons 2nd Edition\">"],"setting":"Dragon Magazine","statblock":{"Golem, Tin":{"Activity Cycle":"Any","Alignment":"Neutral","Armor Class":"4","Climate/Terrain":"Any","Damage/Attack":"1-12","Diet":"Pretty little, considering that it doesn't eat","Frequency":"Usually rare","Hit Dice":"10 (45 hp)","Intelligence":"Non- (0)","Magic Resistance":"Nil","Morale":"Fearless (20)","Movement":"6","No. Appearing":"1","No. of Attacks":"1 weapon","Organization":"None","Size":"M (6-7' tall)","Special Attacks":"Nil","Special Defenses":"Resistances and immunities to spells and weapons","THAC0":"11","Treasure":"Nil","XP Value":"3,000"}},"title":"Golem, Tin"},"sources":["Dragon#156"],"statblock_names":[],"title":"Golem, Tin","prev_key":"gellmons","next_key":"killspru","catelog_book":"Dragon156","catelog_setting":"dr","monster_path":"/catalog/dr/Dragon156/goletin"}},"staticQueryHashes":[],"slicesMap":{}}
