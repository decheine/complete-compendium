A vartha is a guardian spirit in many senses. It can be a spirit conjured or cursed to protect a specific area or treasure. It can also be a spirit that appears to aid a character in times of need. Lastly, it can be a spirit sent to hunt down wrongdoers. A vartha does not share the generally gruesome appearance of the undead. It looks like a newly dead corpse, after the body has been treated by a mortician.</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Combat:</b> A vartha has high attribute scores (S 18/75, D 16, C 16, I 13, W 17, Ch 15). It wears partial plate armor +2 (AC 2) and wields a morning star +2. The magical items and attribute scores have been calculated into the vartha's statistics.</p><p>While it is undead, a vartha should otherwise be treated as a fighter-cleric with the following clerical spells, each of which can be cast at the rate of one spell per round, once each per day: <i>bless</i>, <i>command</i>, <i>detect evil</i>, <i>light</i>, <i>remove fear</i>; <i>sanctuary</i>; <i>augury</i>, <i>detect charm</i>, <i>hold person</i>, <i>know alignment</i>, <i>silence 15' radius</i>; <i>animate dead</i>, <i>dispel magic</i>, <i>locate object</i>, <i>remove curse</i>; <i>detect lie</i>, <i>tongues</i>; <i>commune</i>.</p><p>A vartha can be of any alignment. One of evil alignment may have the reverse of appropriate spells (e.g., <i>curse</i> instead of <i>bless</i>).</p><p>A vartha is not affected by <i>sleep</i>, <i>charm</i>, <i>hold</i>, cold, electricity, poison, or death magic. A <i>raise dead</i> spell returns it to life as a 9th-level fighter/9th-level cleric. If the vartha serves anyone involuntarily, it need not make a save vs. spells against the <i>raise dead</i> spell, and the spell automatically works. The chance for a cleric to turn a vartha is the same as the chance to turn a spectre.</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Habitat/Society:</b> Vartha vary in motivation. A vartha guarding its own treasure may have voluntarily become undead through greed. A vartha forced to guard a treasure not its own may be under a curse or commanded by a more powerful being. A vartha sent by the DM to help a character may be that character's guardian spirit, perhaps an ancestor. A vartha hunting down a wrongdoer may have been a marshall in life, continuing its mission after death. Vartha do share one personality trait: They are all highly motivated, even driven, whatever their purpose.</p>\n","images":["<img src=\"grf/dr.gif\" width=\"150\" height=\"75\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Dragon Magazine\" title=\"Dragon Magazine\" align=\"right\">","<img src=\"img/vartha.gif\" alt=\"Vartha\" title=\"Vartha\" border=\"0\" width=\"300\" height=\"360\" style=\"text-align:right;\" align=\"right\">","<img src=\"grf/add2_01.gif\" width=\"200\" height=\"56\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Advanced Dungeons & Dragons 2nd Edition\">"],"setting":"Dragon Magazine","statblock":{"Vartha":{"Activity Cycle":"Any","Alignment":"Any","Armor Class":"0","Climate/Terrain":"Any","Damage/Attack":"2d4+5","Diet":"None","Frequency":"Very rare","Hit Dice":"9+18 (63 hp)","Intelligence":"High (13)","Magic Resistance":"Nil","Morale":"Fearless (20)","Movement":"12","No. Appearing":"1 or 2-12","No. of Attacks":"3/2, by weapon type","Organization":"Solitary","Size":"M (5-7')","Special Attacks":"Spellcasting, magical items","Special Defenses":"Immunity to some spells","THAC0":"7","Treasure":"Varies","XP Value":"18,000"}},"title":"Vartha"},"sources":["Dragon198"],"statblock_names":[],"title":"Vartha","prev_key":"skulride","next_key":"wighking","catelog_book":"Dragon198","catelog_setting":"dr","monster_path":"/catalog/dr/Dragon198/vartha"}},"staticQueryHashes":[],"slicesMap":{}}
