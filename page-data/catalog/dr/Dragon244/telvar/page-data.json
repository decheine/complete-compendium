They live in large clans and avoid contact with other races whenever possible.</p><p>Telvar are extremely tall, averaging almost 8 feet in height. They are quick and agile but not nearly as strong as humans or even <a href=\"/appendix/elf\">elves</a>. They have abnormally long fingers and toes, and they can use their feet to grip small objects. Telvar have large feathered wings that grow from their shouldersâ€”pre-dominant colors are brown, gray, and white. Telvar have large, sharply pointed ears, as well as large eyes with two sets of eyelids. Telvar are usually heavily tattooed, the tattoos signifying important events such as the first hunt, a first kill, and family membership. Telvar dress in layers of loose-fitting clothing mostly the hides of various game animals.</p><p>Every male in each family is expected to be a proficient warrior and hunter; the weak do not usually survive childhood. Women are often trained as hunters and face the same rigorous training demands as the men. Women who aren't hunters either gather food or serve as family priests. All Telvar religious figures are women. While they cannot be the head of a family, they have great authority as spiritual and community advisors.</p><p>Telvar occasionally travel to cities for trade, but they feel uncomfortable when surrounded by multitudes of groundbased races. They are honorable in all their dealings and take extreme offense at being cheated or lied to. Telvar rarely develop strong relationships with other races, but they are staunch allies once they have committed themselves to an alliance. Of the four flying races detailed here, the Telvar are the least likely to be encountered as enemies of most bands of PCs.</p><p>Telvar have infravision to a range of 80 feet.</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Combat:</b> The Telvar are talented archers, able to fell their quarry from great distances while flying overhead. They are so skilled with the great bow that they gain a +2 bonus to damage for each successful bow attack. Telvar can never be specialized in melee weapons.</p><p>Telvar have very little magic to support combat operations. The priestly magic wielded by the females is used mainly for divination and healing, although female cleric/fighters are not unknown. Because of this lack of magic, Telvar consistently attack enemy spell-casters until they are neutralized. If they cannot defeat the spellcasters, they will withdraw until another opportunity presents itself.</p><p>If possible, and as long as their arrows hold out, Telvar attack ground-based enemies with missile fire. They do not engage in melee combat unless absolutely necessary or when an enemy has been severely weakened. Most Telvar wield long thin swords that inflict damage as short swords.</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Ecology:</b> The Telvar take great pains to live in harmony with the natural world. They realize that a balance must be maintained to ensure the long-term survival of each clan, so there is strict adherence to territorial hunting lands and no over-hunting within these lands. Travelers who pass through Telvar lands may do so without fear, provided they do not upset the balance that the Telvar have maintained for centuries.</p><p>Many races mistake the simple ways of the Telvar for a lack of intelligence. However, when necessary, the Telvar are capable of developing sophisticated military plans requiring complex co-ordination between clans. Those who have underestimated Telvar resolve have met with defeat, demonstrated by the fall of many humanoid bands that have tried to infringe upon Telvar territory.</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Habitat/Society:</b> Telvar are flying barbarians, building no cities and living off the land. They are fierce warriors, hardened by generations of subsistence living in harsh climates. The Telvar are nomads, traveling in large family groups that follow the yearly migrations of various herd animals.</p><p>The heads of every Telvar family meet every two years to settle disputes, discuss hunting strategies, and-on rare occasions-plan war against anyone infringing on their hunting grounds. Leadership in each Telvar family is determined by combat. Every three years, all warriors in each family are given the opportunity to challenge the current head of the family to ritual combat. Each battle lasts until one side concedes defeat. Defeated challengers often leave the family, either to start their own family or possibly to hire themselves out as mercenaries.</p><img src=\"/img/spc/telvar1.gif\" alt=\"Telvar\" title=\"Telvar\" style=\"float: right;\"><p class=\"f\"><b>Roleplaying Notes</b></p><p class=\"ni\">For some Telvar, the lure of the civilized world proves stronger than family ties. These young, idealistic individuals often leave the clan to find their fortune elsewhere. In addition, Telvar warriors who fail in their challenge for clan leadership almost always leave the family for a period of years, although many eventually return.</p><p>Telvar are comfortable with large groups and shared decision-making responsibilities. They can adapt their skill easily to the needs of a large adventuring group, but they prefer not to become involved in pitched battles. They often fulfill the role of scout and missile weapon specialist in a party. Telvar love to hunt, and they are masters of hit-andrun tactics and ambushes.</p><p>Telvar are used to hardship and the need to push themselves beyond their supposed physical limits. They expect similar sacrifices from their companions and have little patience for individuals who do not contribute to the common good. Their lack of tact in these situations can lead to tension with other members of an adventuring party.</p><p>Due to their difficulty in maneuvering in small spaces, Telvar have a great fear of being underground.</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Telvar Magical Items</b></p><p class=\"f\"><b>Hunter Cloaks</b></p><p class=\"ni\">The best hunter in each Telvar family wears a <i>hunter cloak</i>, a garment that is magically enhanced to make the wearer virtually invisible to creatures with animal intelligence. The wearer makes no sound when flying emits no smells, and absorbs any sound used by animals with echolocation. The <i>cloak</i> also gives the wearer <i>invisibility</i> to animals as long as the wearer is in the air; the <i>cloak</i> imparts no special benefits to wearers who are on the ground. The wearer can attack creatures with animal intelligence without losing the benefits of the <i>cloak</i>, but the <i>cloak</i> has no effect on any creatures with greater than animal intelligence.</p><p>XP Value: 1,500 GP Value: 3,000</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Cloak of the Telvar</b></p><p class=\"ni\">The Telvar excel at air-to-air combat. Their skills were put to the test against the <a href=\"/appendix/fainil\">Fainil</a>. To aid in these battles, the female clerics of each family created <i>concussion arrows</i>, specifically designed for use against the Fainil. The arrows have a +3 bonus to hit and damage, and a successful hit causes the arrow to explode, creating a shock wave that stuns anyone within 10 feet of the blast who fails a save vs. spells. The stun effect lasts for only one round.</p><p>XP Value: 300, GP Value: 650</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Shield of the Underdark</b></p><p class=\"ni\">The Fainil's most powerful item of defense against the Telvar is the <i>shield of the Underdark</i>. The <i>shield of the Underdark</i> is actually a normal appearing buckler and was often carried by an inconspicuous member of a Fainil combat unit. Once a day, by sacrificing all of his hit points but 1, the bearer of the shield can create a magical barrier in a 20' radius from his body that acts as <i>protection from normal missiles</i> spell and grants 15% magic resistance to everyone within the barrier. This protection lasts for 15 rounds or until the shield bearer is killed or rendered unconscious.</p><p>XP Value: 4,500, GP Value: 15,000</p>\n","images":["<img src=\"grf/dm.gif\" width=\"150\" height=\"75\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Dragon Magazine\" title=\"Dragon Magazine\" align=\"right\">","<img src=\"/img/spc/telvar1.gif\" alt=\"Telvar\" title=\"Telvar\" style=\"float: right;\">","<img src=\"grf/tsr_sm.png\" width=\"56\" height=\"59\" border=\"0\" alt=\"TSR\">"],"setting":"Dragon Magazine","statblock":{"Telvar":{"Activity Cycle":"Any","Alignment":"Lawful Neutral","Armor Class":"6","Climate/Terrain":"Mountains","Damage/Attack":"1-8 (+2)/1 -8 (+2) or by weapon","Diet":"Omnivore","Frequency":"Rare","Hit Dice":"2","Intelligence":"Medium","Magic Resistance":"Nil","Morale":"Fanatic (18)","Movement":"6, Fly 12 (B)","No. Appearing":"10-40","No. of Attacks":"2 or by weapon","Organization":"Solitary","Size":"L (8' tall)","Special Attacks":"None","Special Defenses":"None","THAC0":"19","Treasure":"M,Q","XP Value":"65"}},"title":"Telvar"},"sources":["Dragon244"],"statblock_names":[],"title":"Telvar","prev_key":"masgai","next_key":"xakhun","catelog_book":"Dragon244","catelog_setting":"dr","monster_path":"/catalog/dr/Dragon244/telvar"}},"staticQueryHashes":[],"slicesMap":{}}
