Although it is mainly a native of the positive realms, this fairly large creature dwells within the border area storing energy and making occasional forays into the Mineral domains.</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Combat:</b> The stored energy is kept in the botryoidal clusters that are located at the ends of its eight stubby tentacles. Each cluster contains 6d4 nodules, all of which glow with a pulsing, lambent power. During combat, the energy pod flails with these limbs, being able to use two against each opponent in range, two opponents maximum. On a successful hit, 2d4 of the nodules burst open, each releasing a blast of positive energy. Each nodule that breaks inflicts 1d4 +2 hp damage. Once all of the nodules on a tentacle have been broken, that appendage has no effective attack.</p><p>Weapons of at least +2 enchantment are required to strike an energy pod. Since it feeds on power, the creature automatically absorbs the energy of any spells cast upon it, including spell-like effects from devices. This energy is used to create additional nodules, one per spell level absorbed. These nodules appear immediately on a random appendage (roll 1d8 to determine which tentacle).</p><p>Acid thrown on an energy pod will do double damage. The pods have no other particular resistances or vulnerabilities.</p><p>Energy pods are very rarely encountered on the Prime Material plane, almost always as guardians for magical treasures. It is also rumored that there exists a Negative Material plane creature that is a mirror image of the energy pod.</p><p></p><br clear=\"all\" style=\"clear:both; height:0;\">\r\n","images":["<img src=\"grf/dr.gif\" width=\"150\" height=\"75\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Dragon Magazine\" title=\"Dragon Magazine\" align=\"right\">","<img src=\"img/quaelenp.gif\" alt=\"Energy Pod\" title=\"Energy Pod\" border=\"0\" width=\"300\" height=\"360\" style=\"text-align:right;\" align=\"right\">","<img src=\"grf/tsr_sm.png\" width=\"56\" height=\"59\" border=\"0\" alt=\"TSR\">"],"setting":"Dragon Magazine","statblock":{"Energy Pod":{"Activity Cycle":"Any","Alignment":"Neutral","Armor Class":"0","Climate/Terrain":"Plane of Mineral","Damage/Attack":"Variable (see text)","Diet":"Positive energy","Frequency":"Rare (very rare)","Hit Dice":"8","Intelligence":"Low","Magic Resistance":"100% (see text)","Morale":"Steady (11)","Movement":"Fl 12 (B)","No. Appearing":"1 (10% chance of 2)","No. of Attacks":"2 per opponent","Organization":"Solitary or pair","Size":"L (8’ diameter)","Special Attacks":"Nil","Special Defenses":"+2 or better weapon to hit, flight, elemental abilities","THAC0":"13","Treasure":"Nil (U,V)","XP Value":"6,000"}},"title":"Energy Pod"},"sources":["Dragon174"],"statblock_names":[],"title":"Energy Pod","prev_key":"quaelege","next_key":"quaelsha","catelog_book":"Dragon174","catelog_setting":"dr","monster_path":"/catalog/dr/Dragon174/quaelenp"}},"staticQueryHashes":[],"slicesMap":{}}
