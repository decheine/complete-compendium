The leaves of this plant rest flat against the ground and are difficult to see against the terrain (-2 to victim?s roll for being surprised).</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Combat:</b> Anything walking over this plant's leaves becomes stuck, due to the mucilage secreted by glands in the leaves. The plant then attempts to roll all of its leaves up and over its prey (attacking as per its hit dice), becoming a tight, leafy cocoon that fills with digestive fluid, causing 1-4 hp damage per round. Victims holding small, edged weapons when caught may cut themselves free by doing damage equal to half the total hit points of the plant. Attacks from outside inflict half the damage on the plant and half on the victim trapped inside. The mucilage may be neutralized with liberal quantities of alcohol.</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Habitat/Society:</b> One of the most adaptive of carnivorous plants, the giant butterwort is found from arctic to tropical areas, favoring acidic or alkaline bogs with moist to very wet soils.</p><br clear=\"all\" style=\"clear:both; height:0;\">\r\n","images":["<img src=\"grf/dr.gif\" width=\"150\" height=\"75\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Dragon Magazine\" title=\"Dragon Magazine\" align=\"right\">","<img src=\"grf/add2_01.gif\" width=\"200\" height=\"56\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Advanced Dungeons & Dragons 2nd Edition\">"],"setting":"Dragon Magazine","statblock":{"Butterwort, Giant":{"Activity Cycle":"Day","Alignment":"Neutral","Armor Class":"7","Climate/Terrain":"Any bogs, marshes, or swamps","Damage/Attack":"See below","Diet":"Carnivore","Frequency":"Uncommon","Hit Dice":"5","Intelligence":"Non- (0)","Magic Resistance":"Nil","Morale":"Average (10)","Movement":"0","No. Appearing":"1-6","No. of Attacks":"1","Organization":"Solitary","Size":"M","Special Attacks":"Dissolving, surprise","Special Defenses":"Nil","THAC0":"15","Treasure":"Incidental (10% chance each of J,K,M; 5% chance each of Q and one small magical item)","XP Value":"420"}},"title":"Butterwort, Giant"},"sources":["Dragon167"],"statblock_names":[],"title":"Butterwort, Giant","prev_key":"blooflow","next_key":"clubthor","catelog_book":"Dragon167","catelog_setting":"dr","monster_path":"/catalog/dr/Dragon167/butworgi"}},"staticQueryHashes":[],"slicesMap":{}}
