Protected by sharp layers of decorative hide, his face and belly resist the puny attacks of mere mortals. Fully grown, this <a href=\"/appendix/dragon\">dragon</a> would make a match for the hardiest of Cerilia's dying breed. Zakhur attacks using his foreclaws and bite, or he can execute any of the special attacks described in the “Dragon” entry of the MONSTROUS MANUAL™ tome.</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Combat:</b> Zakhur's breath weapon may be the basis for the flaming death that fills the stories of so many dragon-tales. Lifesbane's fiery breath can still be seen on occasion, lighting up the deep passages between the mountains when the dragon hunts. Zakhur can use his fiery breath once every six rounds, immolating anything within a 50' long cone that extends at its widest point to 30'. It inflicts 20d6+20 hp damage on anything in the cone, though victims may attempt to save for half damage. Nonmagical and magical objects alike must save vs. magical fire or be burned, melted, or disintegrated.</p><p>When hunting, Zakhur uses his gaze attack to freeze opponents (save vs. paralyzation at -4 or be paralyzed with terror for 1d3 turns), then he kills and consumes them at his leisure. lust like other great wyrms, however, Zakhur can spend an entire round exerting his will against a victim caught in his gaze and use the powers of <i>geas</i>, <i>suggestion</i>, or <i>feeblemind</i> on his foe with no saving throw allowed.</p><p>If Zakhur engages in combat, all enemies within 50' must save vs. a <i>fear</i> spell (as described in the MONSTROUS MANUAL tome, with a -4 to the roll). Zakhur has learned to mask this ability, however, on those rare occasions that he does not want to kill his opponents — though even the bravest hero may feel his knees knock at the sight of the great wyrm.</p><p>Because of his great scales and the energies imbued upon him by his mother, Zakhur Lifesbane can ignore a portion of the damage he suffers. Any damage die that rolls a natural “1” against him is ignored, regardless of modifiers or spell effects.</p><p>Zakhur shares another great ability with his Cerilian cousins. He can cast wizard spells at the 16th level of ability (or 18th when he actually holds the Heart of the Mountain and uses his mother's energies). Zakhur, however, uses this power only on rare occasions — his mother has taught him to be discrete with his magical energies, lest he anger the gods that have blessed her with peace. Victims of Zakhur's magic suffer -2 modifiers to their saving throws (or -4 if he holds the Heart). Zakhur knows many spells unknown to human or other spellcasters of Cerilia.</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Ecology:</b> More lively than most dragons, Zakhur seldom sleeps for more than a dozen years at a time, and then only lightly. He sees his entire purpose in life as protecting the Five Peaks (the mountains, not the realm) and subjugating or destroying intruders. Zakhur may be approached by stout heroes seeking wisdom — though he must be contacted carefully. Actually seeking out his lair could be disastrous. Like most dragons, Zakhur loves treasure (and has accumulated quite a bit to add to his mother's legendary hoard over the years), but he will not forgo his personal mission just to acquire more.</p><img src=\"/img/spc/zakhurlg1.gif\" alt=\"Zakhur Lifesbane, the Guardian\" title=\"Zakhur Lifesbane, the Guardian\" style=\"width: 100%\">\n","images":["<img src=\"grf/dm.gif\" width=\"150\" height=\"75\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Dragon Magazine\" title=\"Dragon Magazine\" align=\"right\">","<img src=\"/img/spc/zakhurlg1.gif\" alt=\"Zakhur Lifesbane, the Guardian\" title=\"Zakhur Lifesbane, the Guardian\" style=\"width: 100%\">","<img src=\"grf/tsr_sm.png\" width=\"56\" height=\"59\" border=\"0\" alt=\"TSR\">"],"setting":"Dragon Magazine","statblock":{"Zakhur Lifesbane, the Guardian":{"Activity Cycle":"Any","Alignment":"Lawful Neutral","Armor Class":"-5","Climate/Terrain":"The Five Peaks","Damage/Attack":"1d12+10/1d12+10/2d12+10","Diet":"Special","Frequency":"Unique","Hit Dice":"20 (142 hp)","Intelligence":"Genius (17)","Magic Resistance":"50% or special","Morale":"Fearless (20) at home; Champion (15) away","Movement":"9, Fly 30 (B)","No. Appearing":"1","No. of Attacks":"3 or special","Organization":"Solitary","Size":"G (90' long)","Special Attacks":"Breath weapon, spells, dive","Special Defenses":"Fear aura, gaze, spells, invulnerability","THAC0":"1","Treasure":"Hx5","XP Value":"28,000"}},"title":"Zakhur Lifesbane, the Guardian"},"sources":["Dragon230"],"statblock_names":[],"title":"Zakhur Lifesbane, the Guardian","prev_key":"zakhurlg","catelog_book":"Dragon230","catelog_setting":"dr","monster_path":"/catalog/dr/Dragon230/zakhurlg"}},"staticQueryHashes":[],"slicesMap":{}}
