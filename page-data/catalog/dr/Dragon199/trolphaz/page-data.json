However, they are only slightly more than half as tall as a true troll and their frames are thick with corded muscle. Unlike their bigger cousins, phaze trolls always stand upright and have high foreheads, similar to the more intelligent races. The skin of a phaze troll is stiff and leathery, and is covered in tough, knobby lumps. The skin ranges from deep blue to violet to black in color, while the troll's mass of unkempt hair is blue or purple.</p><p>Phaze trolls seem made for the night and the Underdark, possessing superior infravision (120'). Due to their short stature, they only have a 35% chance to successfully scale any surface.</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Combat:</b> Though not very tall, phaze trolls are exceptionally strong and possess sharp claws and teeth. Phaze trolls strike with their clawed hands and fang-filled mouth. They are agile enough to direct each attack at a different opponent. Knowing that their natural attacks aren't as devastating as those of true trolls, phaze trolls often use weapons, preferring pole arms and other two-handed weapons. When a phaze troll uses a weapon, it gets a +4 bonus to damage. It cannot use any of its natural attacks when wielding a weapon.</p><p>Phaze trolls possess some unusual powers that are often helpful in the midst of battle. First, a phaze troll is able to dimensionally shift itself, much like the <i>dimension door</i> spell. Unlike the spell, however, the phaze troll is never disoriented after transport. The troll is also able to cause mirror images of itself to appear as if it had cast the spell of the same name. Both of these powers are innate and may be used at will, one at a time, once per round. Each power may be used a maximum of four times a day at the 6th level of ability.</p><p>Like all trolls, phaze trolls enjoy the ability of regeneration. They regenerate three hit points per round, starting three rounds after being wounded, but are unable to regenerate fire or acid damage. Because of their stockier build, phaze troll limbs aren't easily severed. If cut off by <i>vorpal swords</i> or <i>swords of sharpness</i>, however, the limbs will continue to fight and then rejoin the body after combat, if possible.</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Habitat/Society:</b> Phaze trolls are aberrations, mutants born of normal trolls who spent much time in areas of raw magical energy or strong Underdark radiations. These radiations are known to be the reasons for a phaze troll's powers and enhanced intellect. Sages are puzzled, though, as to why only <i>dimension door</i> and <i>mirror image</i> powers manifested.</p><p>Because of their rarity, phaze trolls don't gather as a race, instead remaining part of the troll tribe into which they were born. Due to their powers and intelligence, they often lead their tribes. Usually, it is an uneasy partnership between the phaze troll and the largest female troll shaman. Phaze trolls are at a disadvantage in such pairings, as they are incapable of magic. Some, however, can use psionics as a psionicist of up to 3rd level. Such psionicist phaze trolls usually have powers from the disciplines of Psychokinesis, Psychometabolism, and Telepathy.\r\nPhaze troll genders are equal in size, strength, and intelligence. Eighty percent of phaze trolls are sterile and cannot reproduce. This is good, for when phaze trolls successfully mate, they breed true. Phaze trolls reach maturity very quickly, and can live for up to 150 years.</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Ecology:</b> Phaze trolls are always hungry, and will eat whatever meat presents itself. Phaze trolls are a scourge wherever they exist, depleting the local area of wildlife and threatening the good races with daring raids on the outposts of civilization.</p><p>Their blood is valuable in the making of healing and mind-affecting magics, while their bones are helpful in fashioning magical items dealing with dimensional travel and illusions.</p><p></p><br clear=\"all\" style=\"clear:both; height:0;\">\r\n","images":["<img src=\"grf/dr.gif\" width=\"150\" height=\"75\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Dragon Magazine\" title=\"Dragon Magazine\" align=\"right\">","<img src=\"img/trolphaz.gif\" alt=\"Troll, Phaze\" title=\"Troll, Phaze\" border=\"0\" width=\"300\" height=\"360\" style=\"text-align:right;\" align=\"right\">","<img src=\"grf/add2_01.gif\" width=\"200\" height=\"56\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Advanced Dungeons & Dragons 2nd Edition\">"],"setting":"Dragon Magazine","statblock":{"Troll, Phaze":{"Activity Cycle":"Night","Alignment":"Chaotic evil","Armor Class":"3","Climate/Terrain":"Any/Land, subterranean","Damage/Attack":"1d4+2 (&times;2)/1d6+2","Diet":"Carnivore","Frequency":"Very rare","Hit Dice":"5+8","Intelligence":"Average to High (8-14)","Magic Resistance":"Nil","Morale":"Champion (16)","Movement":"12","No. Appearing":"1-3","No. of Attacks":"3","Organization":"Tribe","Size":"M (5')","Special Attacks":"See below","Special Defenses":"Regeneration","THAC0":"15","Treasure":"Q (D)","XP Value":"975<br>Psionicist: 2,000"}},"title":"Troll, Phaze"},"sources":["Dragon199"],"statblock_names":[],"title":"Troll, Phaze","prev_key":"trolhoun","next_key":"trolston","catelog_book":"Dragon199","catelog_setting":"dr","monster_path":"/catalog/dr/Dragon199/trolphaz"}},"staticQueryHashes":[],"slicesMap":{}}
