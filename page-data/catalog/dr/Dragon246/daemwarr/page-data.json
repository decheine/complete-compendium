They form a major component of the armies raised to destroy all Krynn. These creatures have no true physical form, instead appearing differently to all who see them, as the most frightening thing their victims can imagine (see below).</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Combat:</b> As “common” soldiers in the army of Chaos, daemon warriors employ the same manner of weaponry as do human, humanoid, and demi-human races, though such weapons appear in eerie and bizarre forms. They have a “natural” Armor Class of 0; although they appear to be clad in armor of various designs, this is merely more crafted illusion to aid in the generation of fear.</p><p>Daemon warriors generate a fear aura that extends 10 feet in all directions, affecting all creatures with less than 20 Intelligence. (Note that the exact shape does not matter in combat, but the daemon warrior typically appears as something of medium size.) Any living creature approached by a daemon warrior must make a successful save vs. spell with a -2 penalty or flee in panic for 3d10 rounds. Since the daemon warrior always appears as everyone's worst nightmare come true, having more Hit Dice than the daemon warrior does not grant immunity to the fear aura.</p><p>Daemon warriors are immune to non-blessed and nonmagical weapons. Weapons that have been blessed, whether via the clerical spell or directly by a deity, destroy the daemon warrior on contact, while holy and magical weapons inflict normal damage. This immunity also applies to attacks with bodily weapons such as fists, horns, etc., unless the attacker has 7 HD or more.</p><p>When reduced to zero hit points, the daemon warrior explodes in flames, inflicting 1d6 hp damage to all within 5 feet. In addition, the explosion automatically destroys the weapon striking it, though magical weapons are entitled to a save vs. crushing blow with a +1 bonus per “plus.” A clerical holy symbol of any religion thrust into the creature destroys both it and the symbol if the priest makes a successful attack roll.</p><p>Daemon warriors are immune to fire, even magical flames such as a <i>fireball</i> spell or <a href=\"dragcred\">red dragon</a> breath. They have 10% magic resistance as well. As undead, they are unaffected by <i>sleep</i>, <i>charm</i>, <i>hold</i>, or cold-based spells and are also immune to poison and paralyzation. Holy water splashed on them inflicts 2-8 hp damage per vial, while a <i>raise dead</i> spell destroys them instantly if they fail to save vs death magic. Although they dislike sunlight, often lurking with shadowwights for this reason, they are not actually harmed by it.</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Habitat/Society:</b> Daemon warriors are undead beings who are specially organized for warfare, roaming singly or in small bands across the countryside, attacking everything in sight. During these forays, they often ride fire dragons. While large armies are possible, as in the assault on the High Clerist's Tower, these creatures are chaotic beings who hate any kind of order, as does their creator.</p><p>Any daemon warriors encountered are probably guarding some sensitive place Chaos wants protected or (more likely) are assaulting a place the PCs are protecting or simply going on a murderous rampage through the countryside. They do not negotiate, attacking on sight and fighting to the death. This behavior makes them particularly dangerous opponents if they outnumber the enemy, for if they cannot panic their opponents, they bore steadily in, ignoring all losses until the enemy runs out of weapons.</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Ecology:</b> Undead beings generally have no effect on the local ecology, other than to ensure that there isn't any in their immediate vicinity. Daemon warriors expand this concept, as their reason for existing is to wipe out all life on Krynn, taking the offensive against the living rather than merely lurking in some tomb awaiting all comers. They require no food, being sustained solely by the powers of Chaos. It is theoretically possible that their essence, or the residue remaining after one of them explodes, can be used in the creation of magical items such as a <i>wand of fear</i>, <i>wand of polymorphing</i>, <i>ring of fire resistance</i>, or scroll ink for spells that have similar effect.</p>\n","images":["<img src=\"grf/dr.gif\" width=\"150\" height=\"75\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Dragon Magazine\" title=\"Dragon Magazine\" align=\"right\">","<img src=\"img/daemwarr.gif\" alt=\"Daemon Warrior\" title=\"Daemon Warrior\" border=\"0\" width=\"300\" height=\"360\" style=\"text-align:right;\" align=\"right\">","<img src=\"grf/tsr_sm.png\" width=\"56\" height=\"59\" border=\"0\" alt=\"TSR\">"],"setting":"Dragon Magazine","statblock":{"Daemon Warrior":{"Activity Cycle":"Any","Alignment":"Chaotic evil","Armor Class":"0","Climate/Terrain":"Any","Damage/Attack":"By weapon type","Diet":"See below","Frequency":"Very rare","Hit Dice":"5","Intelligence":"Genius (18)","Magic Resistance":"10%","Morale":"Fanatic (17)","Movement":"12, FI 18 (A)","No. Appearing":"2-20","No. of Attacks":"1","Organization":"Solitary","Size":"M (4’-7’)","Special Attacks":"Fear aura","Special Defenses":"Immune to fire, nonblessed weapons","THAC0":"15","Treasure":"B","XP Value":"5,000"}},"title":"Daemon Warrior"},"sources":["Dragon246"],"statblock_names":[],"title":"Daemon Warrior","prev_key":"wighchao","next_key":"dragfire","catelog_book":"Dragon246","catelog_setting":"dr","monster_path":"/catalog/dr/Dragon246/daemwarr"}},"staticQueryHashes":[],"slicesMap":{}}
