If both front claws strike, the beast can rake with its rear claws (1d4 points each), as well as bite with a +4 bonus to the attack roll. Such bites inflict the maximum damage each round until the beast is dislodged or killed. Dislodging a thylacine requires a successful bend bars/lift gates roll.

The thylacine is immune to charm, fear, and other mindcontrolling or influencing spells. It cannot be magically sensed or summoned.</p><p>One out of five thylacines can cast an illusion upon itself once a day; the illusion makes the beast appear to be human.

It prefers a variety of game, including large herbivores, small predators, and humanoids. It stays clear of communities and roads.</p><p>Thylacines are solitary hunters. Even mating occurs only once every 12 years. At this time, mature thylacines are driven by instinct to travel to isolated forests and arctic regions. There they form prides of 10-40 individuals. They stay together for months, hunting en masse and howling loudly as they do so. The males then leave the region. The pregnant females remain together. Six months after conception, each female gives birth to one to three cubs. The cubs remain with their mothers in the pride until they are fully grown in three years. The pack breaks up as the young mature and the females return to their isolation. The newly matured thylacine are left to find their own hunting ranges.</p><p>Thylacine have been known to live as long as 70 years, although most die early.</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Ecology:</b> Thylacines may make alliances with other intelligent felines or feline monsters when dealing with a common problem or foe.
