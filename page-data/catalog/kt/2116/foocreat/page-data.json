Their bodies appear somewhat leonine, with thick fur and large, padded feet. Their forelegs resemble those of lions, while their hind legs are more doglike.</p><p>Foo dogs are the most frequently encountered species of this creature. They have short, bush-tipped tails, long floppy ears, and broad noses. Their fur is typically golden or black, but also may be white, green, violet, or gray.</p><p>Each foo creature - dog or lion - speaks its own language as well as the language of other foo creatures. All foo creatures also speak the language of human or humanoid races with whom they have formed relationships.</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Combat:</b> Foo dogs bite and attack with their claws. When engaged in combat with opponents of evil alignment, the dogs attack as if they were 10 HD creatures. If the opponents are lawful evil, foo dogs gain a +1 bonus to their attack and damage rolls. Evil opponents who attack foo dogs suffer a -1 penalty to their attack rolls and inflicted damage.</p><p>Foo dogs can <i>become invisible</i> and <i>ethereal</i> at will. They can travel astrally and ethereally, both at will. In addition, their thunderous barking is 20% likely to create a gate that summons 1-6 additional foo dogs, provided the barking lasts 7 consecutive rounds or more.</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Habitat/Society:</b> Foo dogs can be encountered in any location in the Prime Material Plane, though they make their homes in the Astral Plane, Ethereal Plane, and various Outer Planes, particularly  Olympus and Gladshiem. On occasion, they can be convinced to associate themselves with humans or humanoids of good alignment on the Prime Material Plane, especially if the person requesting assistance impresses the foo dog as being kind and benevolent, or if the cause appeals to the foo dog's sense of justice. However, regardless of circumstance, a foo dog will not voluntarily remain in the Prime Material Plane for extended periods. A stay of more than a few weeks is rare.</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Ecology:</b> Foo dogs can consume virtually any inorganic matter in the Prime Material Plane. They enjoy devouring gems and precious metals in particular, especially platinum and silver.</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Foo Lions</b></p>  <p class=\"ni\">Foo lions look like big foo dogs with longer tails and larger mouths. Shaggy manes encircle their necks. Sometimes the manes are entangled with peony flowers. A foo lion's fur may be a variety of colors, but is most commonly black, orange, or gold.</p><p>Foo lions share the outlook, personality, diet, and habitats of foo dogs. They also have the same abilities and attack techniques. Though foo lions feel no animosity towards foo dogs, the two creatures rarely associate with one another.</p><p>When engaged in combat by opponents of evil alignment, foo lions attack as if they were 15 HD creatures. For opponents of evil alignment, attacking a foo lion involves the same penalties as attacking a foo dog. If a foo lion roars for at least 7 consecutive rounds, it has a 20% chance of gating in 1-2 additional foo lions.</p><p>Many noblemen of Kara-Tur consider foo lions to be symbols of courage and strength. Emblems of these creatures often are embroidered on the court robes of military officials. Stone statues of foo lions stand in front of many official buildings. On occasion, these statues and emblems are magically enchanted by wu jen, allowing them to petition foo lions in their home planes.</p><p></p><br clear=\"all\" style=\"clear:both; height:0;\">\r\n","images":["<img src=\"grf/kt.gif\" width=\"150\" height=\"75\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Kara-Tur (Forgotten Realms)\" title=\"Kara-Tur (Forgotten Realms)\" align=\"right\">","<img src=\"img/foocreat.gif\" alt=\"Foo Creature\" title=\"Foo Creature\" border=\"0\" width=\"300\" height=\"360\" style=\"text-align:right;\" align=\"right\">","<img src=\"grf/add2_01.gif\" width=\"200\" height=\"56\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Advanced Dungeons & Dragons 2nd Edition\">"],"setting":"Kara-Tur (Forgotten Realms)","statblock":{"Foo Dog":{"Activity Cycle":"Any","Alignment":"Chaotic good","Armor Class":"0","Climate/Terrain":"Any land","Damage/Attack":"2-5/2-5/1-12","Diet":"Special","Frequency":"Rare","Hit Dice":"7+7","Intelligence":"Very (11-12)","Magic Resistance":"45%","Morale":"Elite (13)","Movement":"27","No. Appearing":"2-8","No. of Attacks":"3","Organization":"Mated pair or pack","Size":"M (3-4' long)","Special Attacks":"+1 vs. lawful evil","Special Defenses":"See below","THAC0":"13 (or 11)","Treasure":"Nil","XP Value":"3,000"},"Foo Lion":{"Activity Cycle":"Any","Alignment":"Chaotic good","Armor Class":"-1","Climate/Terrain":"Astral, ethereal, and various Outer Planes","Damage/Attack":"2-8/2-8/2-16","Diet":"Special","Frequency":"Very rare","Hit Dice":"11+11","Intelligence":"Exceptional (15-16)","Magic Resistance":"55%","Morale":"Champion (15)","Movement":"21","No. Appearing":"1-4","No. of Attacks":"3","Organization":"Solitary or pride","Size":"L (7' long)","Special Attacks":"+1 vs. lawful evil","Special Defenses":"See below","THAC0":"9 (or 5)","Treasure":"Nil","XP Value":"7,000"}},"title":"Foo Creature"},"sources":["2116","2602"],"statblock_names":[],"title":"Foo Creature","prev_key":"flamspir","next_key":"gaki","catelog_book":"2116","catelog_setting":"kt","monster_path":"/catalog/kt/2116/foocreat"}},"staticQueryHashes":[],"slicesMap":{}}
