All are associated with a particular object or place from which they derive their lifeforce.</p><p>Lesser nature spirits, the most common variety, are those of trees, flowers, rocks, and bamboo groves. When encountered, they usually take the form of a handsome young man or beautiful maiden (using their ability to <i>polymorph</i>).</p><p>All nature spirits speak the languages common to the area they inhabit, as well as the tongues of all other nature spirits.</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Combat:</b> All nature spirits are possessed of two aspects - one good, one evil. The good aspect causes the nature spirit to be helpful and kind. The evil aspect leads the spirit to be savage and cruel. When encountered, there is a 75% chance that the good aspect is dominant. However, if the evil aspect is dominant, the nature spirit will attack anyone who trespasses on his territory or threatens the object or place to which its lifeforce is tied.</p><p>All nature spirits can make physical attacks with their hands (or other appendages), though they cannot wield weapons. Additionally, all nature spirits can use the following abilities at will, once per round: <i>become invisible</i>, <i>polymorph self</i>, <i>detect evil</i> (and <i>detect good</i>), <i>detect magic</i>, and <i>detect harmony</i>.</p><p>If the object or place that provides a nature spirit's lifeforce is damaged, the spirit suffers accordingly. For example, if a woodsman fells the tree of a lesser nature spirit, that spirit will die.</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Habitat/Society:</b> A nature spirit seldom strays far from the object or place that provides its lifeforce; usually, it stays within it. Most nature spirits shun contact with the mortal world. In times of danger, however, the nature spirit manifests itself.</p><p>Nature spirits have complete knowledge of the area around the source of their lifeforce. As a result, they can locate hidden treasures and lost items with ease.</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Ecology:</b> It is not uncommon for a lesser nature spirit to marry a mortal. Such romances are the basis of many tales and legends that circulate throughout the lands of Kara-Tur.</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Least Nature Spirit</b></p><p class=\"ni\">Least nature spirits are less intelligent, less powerful, and more shy than lesser nature spirits; otherwise, the two are identical. Least nature spirits include those of twigs, small stones, and streams. When encountered, they usually have <i>polymorphed</i> into the form of a small child. Their evil actions often take the form of annoying or mischievous pranks.</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Greater Nature Spirit</b></p><p class=\"ni\">Greater nature spirits are those of mountains, boulders, extremely ancient trees, and small islands. They are considerably more powerful than lesser nature spirits. In addition to the abilities of all nature spirits, they can <i>shapechange</i> five times per day, use <i>know history</i> and <i>aura</i> at will, and use <i>reward</i> and <i>ancient curse</i> each once per week. In addition, they can cast all wu jen spells of the element that corresponds to their lifeforce (except <i>conjure elemental</i>), once per day. Thus, a greater mountain spirit can cast all earth-related spells, while a greater island spirit can cast all water-related spells (water being more dominant than earth in this case). They can only be struck by +4 weapons or better and are immune to magical attacks using their element.</p><p>Like other nature spirits, greater nature spirits have complete knowledge of all events in their areas. However, the greater nature spirits tend to be more haughty and irritable. Should a village be built on a prominent slope of a greater mountain spirit, he may attempt to drive the settlers away. Mortals often go to great lengths to avoid upsetting greater nature spirits, presenting them with frequent offerings and consulting shukenja before undertaking an enterprise that might anger them.</p><p></p><br clear=\"all\" style=\"clear:both; height:0;\">\r\n","images":["<img src=\"grf/kt.gif\" width=\"150\" height=\"75\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Kara-Tur (Forgotten Realms)\" title=\"Kara-Tur (Forgotten Realms)\" align=\"right\">","<img src=\"grf/add2_01.gif\" width=\"200\" height=\"56\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Advanced Dungeons & Dragons 2nd Edition\">"],"setting":"Kara-Tur (Forgotten Realms)","statblock":{"Greater Nature Spirit":{"Activity Cycle":"Any","Alignment":"Variable","Armor Class":"2","Climate/Terrain":"Any","Damage/Attack":"1-10/1-10","Diet":"Special","Frequency":"Common","Hit Dice":"8 to 15","Intelligence":"Genius (17-18)","Magic Resistance":"70%","Morale":"Elite (14)","Movement":"12","No. Appearing":"1","No. of Attacks":"2","Organization":"Solitary","Size":"Variable","Special Attacks":"See below","Special Defenses":"See below","THAC0":"8 HD: 13<br>9-10 HD: 11<br>11-12 HD: 9<br>13-14 HD: 7<br>15 HD: 5","Treasure":"H","XP Value":"8 HD: 4,000<br>9 HD: 5,000<br>10 HD: 6,000<br>11 HD: 7,000<br>12 HD: 8,000<br>13 HD: 9,000<br>14 HD: 10,000<br>15 HD: 11,000"},"Least Nature Spirit":{"Activity Cycle":"Any","Alignment":"Variable","Armor Class":"9","Climate/Terrain":"Any","Damage/Attack":"1-4","Diet":"Special","Frequency":"Common","Hit Dice":"1","Intelligence":"Average (8-10)","Magic Resistance":"10%","Morale":"Steady (11)","Movement":"12","No. Appearing":"1","No. of Attacks":"1","Organization":"Solitary","Size":"Variable","Special Attacks":"See below","Special Defenses":"See below","THAC0":"20","Treasure":"P","XP Value":"120"},"Lesser Nature Spirit":{"Activity Cycle":"Any","Alignment":"Variable","Armor Class":"7","Climate/Terrain":"Any","Damage/Attack":"1-8","Diet":"Special","Frequency":"Common","Hit Dice":"2 to 7","Intelligence":"Very to genius (11-18)","Magic Resistance":"20%","Morale":"Steady (12)","Movement":"12","No. Appearing":"1","No. of Attacks":"1","Organization":"Solitary","Size":"Variable","Special Attacks":"See below","Special Defenses":"See below","THAC0":"2 HD: 19<br>3-4 HD: 17<br>5-6 HD: 15<br>7 HD: 13","Treasure":"I","XP Value":"2 HD: 175<br>3 HD: 270<br>4 HD: 420<br>5 HD: 650<br>6 HD: 975<br>7 HD: 1,400"}},"title":"Spirit, Nature"},"sources":["2116"],"statblock_names":[],"title":"Spirit, Nature","prev_key":"spirfolk","next_key":"spirston","catelog_book":"2116","catelog_setting":"kt","monster_path":"/catalog/kt/2116/spirnatu"}},"staticQueryHashes":[],"slicesMap":{}}
