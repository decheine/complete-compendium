But the mahogany constrictor is both poisonous and magical. Its scales are a rich reddish-brown, with a spiral pattern of black and white scales running down its back.</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Combat:</b> A mahogany constrictor's crushing grip is unlike that of other serpents Because of its great size, it can do more than kill by asphyxiation, it can literally crush bones and rupture organs. As a result, its constriction damage increases each round it holds a victim in its coils. The first round damage is 1d4, but this increases by 1d4 each round to 2d4 in the second, 3d4 in the third.</p><p>The contrictor can also bite with its enormous fangs. Its venom is relatively dilute for such a large animal. but there is lots of it. The poison begins working in 1d3 rounds and then inflicts [UNKNOWN, WORKING ON IT](half if a saving throw is successful).</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Habitat/Society:</b> Mahogany constrictors live in deep jungles, coastal swamps of Cypress, and along forested riverbanks - anywhere there is both water and shelter. They hunt both in the trees and on the ground, approaching prey very slowly. <a href=\"/appendix/gianfhoi\">Fhoimorien</a> inhabit desolate marshes and forest from the seashores to the mountains, as well as living in deep caves.</p><img src=\"/img/spc/mahocons1.gif\" alt=\"Mahogany Constrictor wooden staff form, with a hand at the top.\" width=\"300\" height=\"360\" title=\"Mahogany Constrictor\" style=\"float:left\">\n","images":["<img src=\"grf/br.gif\" width=\"150\" height=\"75\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Birthright\" title=\"Birthright\" align=\"right\">","<img src=\"img/mahocons.gif\" alt=\"Mahogany Constrictor\" title=\"Mahogany Constrictor\" border=\"0\" width=\"300\" height=\"360\" style=\"text-align:right;\" align=\"right\">","<img src=\"/img/spc/mahocons1.gif\" alt=\"Mahogany Constrictor wooden staff form, with a hand at the top.\" width=\"300\" height=\"360\" title=\"Mahogany Constrictor\" style=\"float:left\">","<img src=\"grf/tsr_sm.png\" width=\"56\" height=\"59\" border=\"0\" alt=\"TSR\">"],"setting":"Birthright","statblock":{"Mahogany Constrictor":{"Activity Cycle":"Any","Alignment":"Neutral evil","Armor Class":"3","Climate/Terrain":"Subtropical forest, marsh, or subterranean","Damage/Attack":"3d6 + venom","Diet":"ca·rnivore","Frequency":"Uncommon","Hit Dice":"4+3","Intelligence":"Low (8-10)","Magic Resistance":"Nil","Morale":"Elite (14)","Movement":"9, Cl 3","No. Appearing":"Unknown","No. of Attacks":"1 or 1","Organization":"Solitary","Size":"H (21' long)","Special Attacks":"Constriction (1d4/round)","Special Defenses":"Only surprised on a 1, displacement","THAC0":"15","Treasure":"Nil","XP Value":"1,400"}},"title":"Mahogany Constrictor"},"sources":["3118","2173"],"statblock_names":[],"title":"Mahogany Constrictor","prev_key":"monkking","next_key":"monkking","catelog_book":"3118","catelog_setting":"br","monster_path":"/catalog/br/3118/mahocons"}},"staticQueryHashes":[],"slicesMap":{}}
