In animal form, he often wears jewelry or a crown. In either form, he carries a long staff (see the <i>Sceptre of the Monkey King</i>).</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Combat:</b> He attacks without weapons in a wobbling, completely unpredictable manner. This form of combat allows him to strike twice each round for 1d6 points of damage per attack. and he can attempt to Pick Pockets on a successful strike. In trees or when otherwise hanging above the ground, the Monkey King can use his remarkably long and flexible prehensile tail to attempt to Pick Pockets or to trip an opponent.</p><p><b>Taunting:</b> If the Monkey King is allowed to hoot and jeer for 1 round, the taunting has the same effect as a <i>taunt</i> spell. During the taunting, the Monkey King throws scraps of food and offal and grimaces at the target.</p><p>In human form, the Monkey King has his staff sceptre, striking once per round for 2d6+4 points of damage.</p><p>The Monkey King has a natural telepathy that is always active, making him impossible to surprise or deceive. In mortal danger he is 90% likely to have a \"bad feeling\" and 25% likely to know exactly what will happen.</p><p>He has the spell-like abilities <i>anti-magic shell</i> (3 times per day), <i>charm person</i> on anyone affectionate to monkeys, <i>plane shift</i>, and <i>teleport</i>.</p><p>The Monkey King is immune to all charm-related spells, including spells that can compel action (for example, <i>geas</i>). He can summon 2d6 monkeys three times per day with 100% chance of success. He has a superior sense of smell and remarkable simian speed and balance.</p><p>The Monkey King can perform all thieving abilities -  including Read Languages and Read Magical Scrolls - at a 95% chance of success. He climbs walls at a 100% chance of success.</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Habitat/Ecology:</b> The Monkey King tends to the affairs of monkeys throughout the planes and worlds. He protects tribes of monkeys threatened by humans. The Monkey King prefers warm weathcr, sweet fruit, and lazy days. However, whenever he finds a pleasing place he soons grows restless. In addition to food and shelter, he requires adventure, pranks, and trickery. These have driven him to leave many safe havens for the wilds of the world.</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Sceptre of the Monkey King:</b> </p><p class=\"ni\">Though it takes many foms, the Monker King is never without his sceptre, a magical rod that allows him to pole vault over all obstacles and that lifts him up into the sky to ride the clouds (as the <i>air walk</i> spell). The sceptre can become a wand, a staff, a cane, a spear, a shovel, or any other long, partially wooden tool. If stolen (and only the most impudent would steal from the Monkey King), the septre functions normally for the thief for one day (long enough for the Monkey King to track down the  sceptre, as long as it has not left the plane where it was stolen). Thereafter, it ceases functioning until again touched by the Monkey King,</p>\n","images":["<img src=\"grf/br.gif\" width=\"150\" height=\"75\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Birthright\" title=\"Birthright\" align=\"right\">","<img src=\"img/monkking.gif\" alt=\"The Monkey King\" title=\"The Monkey King\" border=\"0\" width=\"300\" height=\"360\" style=\"text-align:right;\" align=\"right\">","<img src=\"grf/tsr_sm.png\" width=\"56\" height=\"59\" border=\"0\" alt=\"TSR\">"],"setting":"Birthright","statblock":{"The Monkey King":{"Activity Cycle":"Any","Alignment":"Chaotic neutral","Armor Class":"4","Climate/Terrain":"Any subtropical or tropical land","Damage/Attack":"1d10 (or by weapon +6)","Diet":"Omnivore","Frequency":"Unique","Hit Dice":"15 (120 hp)","Intelligence":"Genius (18)","Magic Resistance":"50%","Morale":"Champion (15-16)","Movement":"15, Cl 18","No. Appearing":"1","No. of Attacks":"1 (2 in trees)","Organization":"Solitary","Size":"M (5'+ tall)","Special Attacks":"Drunken luck, tail, taunting","Special Defenses":"Danger sense, polenult","THAC0":"5","Treasure":"Nil (E, S, Z)","XP Value":"18,000"}},"title":"The Monkey King"},"sources":["3118"],"statblock_names":[],"title":"The Monkey King","prev_key":"mahocons","next_key":"mahocons","catelog_book":"3118","catelog_setting":"br","monster_path":"/catalog/br/3118/monkking"}},"staticQueryHashes":[],"slicesMap":{}}
