They dwell in subterranean areas and are related to <a href=\"/appendix/ooslje01\">ochre jellies</a>. Unlike ochre jellies, scamilles are intelligent and can camouflage themselves.</p><p>In their normal forms, scamilles resemble giant amoebas. Each has a black nucleus surrounded by a mass of rock-gray protoplasm. The protoplasm extrudes six pseudopods. A scamille has a slightly acidic odor, though the scamille does not attack with acid.</p><p>Scamilles use their pliable form to create mouths. They can speak Common, which is their preferred language. Scamilles do not have their own language.</p><p>In general, scamilles are not aggressive. They will wait and observe a party to determine whether it is a threat. If a party is &ldquo;interesting&rdquo; (perhaps clever or eloquent), the scamilles will continue to watch for a while.</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Combat:</b> When at rest, a scamille takes the form of some inanimate object such as a rock, door, wall, table, chair, or chest. Scamilles cannot take the form of living creatures. The ability to change shape is limited, and is not done through conscious effort; when tired, the scamille simply draws its body together. Each scamille can assume the form of only one inanimate object. Though the scamille can change color slightly, a close examination will reveal such an &ldquo;item&rdquo; to be suspect. A camouflaged scamille gives opponents a -1 penalty to surprise rolls.</p><p>Scamilles attack with their six pseudopods, each causing 3d6 points of damage.</p><p>A scamille can cause one pseudopod at a time to become sticky. If a victim is successfully hit with the sticky pseudopod, it is stuck fast. A stuck victim can attack only with a weapon that was already in hand at the time of the scamille's successful assault. A victim attacking in this fashion suffers a -4 penalty to attack rolls. Once a victim is held, the scamille attacks with the remaining five pseudopods, though these have no adhesive quality to them. Attacks on a held victim automatically hit. Spells that require material components cannot be used by a held victim.</p><p>In order to pull free of the sticky pseudopod, the victim must make 2 successfull bend bars rolls. One attempt can be made per round, in place of any attacks the victim might wish to make.</p><p>A scamille can choose to let go of a stuck victim. Otherwise, a victim who fails its bend bars rolls can be freed only by an application of <i>oil of slipperiness</i> or the death of the scamille.</p><p>Once a victim dies, the scamille draws the victim's body into its own and secretes a powerful acid that dissolves the victim and all possessions in 1d4 rounds.</p><p>Scamilles are vulnerable to light. If a <i>light</i> spell is cast upon a scamille, it loses the ability to form pseudopods for one round. If cast on a camouflaged scamille, the <i>light</i> spell causes it to assume its amoebalike form.</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Habitat/Society:</b> Scamilles dwell in dark places such as caves and fissures. They rarely venture above ground, even at night.</p><p>Though scamilles can be found in small groups, there is no group mentaliy. Each scamille acts as it pleases, free of interference from its brethren.</p><p>Scamilles are asexual beings, dividing like amoeba once every five years or so, when enough raw material has been gathered to allow the split. A typical scamille lives 120 years.</p><p>Scamilles like to learn secrets, and because of their camouflage ability, they are in an ideal situation to eavesdrop on other underground dwellers.</p><p>When found in a good mood, a scamille may offer information in exchange for food. However, scamilles are subject to profound mood swings.</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Ecology:</b> Scamilles keep cavern floors clear of obstructions, especially absorbing the remains of intruders to the subterranean world.</p><p>In addition to animal and plant material, scamilles eat small quantities of minerals and rocks, and even derive some sustenance from the remains of a dead victim's equipment. Scamilles enjoy scraps of what humans and demihumans consider food. To a scamille, such scraps are a special taste treat.</p><br clear=\"all\" style=\"clear:both; height:0;\">\r\n","images":["<img src=\"grf/ms.gif\" width=\"150\" height=\"75\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Mystara\" title=\"Mystara\" align=\"right\">","<img src=\"img/scamille.gif\" alt=\"Scamille\" title=\"Scamille\" border=\"0\" width=\"300\" height=\"360\" style=\"text-align:right;\" align=\"right\">","<img src=\"grf/add2_01.gif\" width=\"200\" height=\"56\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Advanced Dungeons & Dragons 2nd Edition\">"],"setting":"Mystara","statblock":{"Scamille":{"Activity Cycle":"Any","Alignment":"Neutral","Armor Class":"5","Climate/Terrain":"Subterranean","Damage/Attack":"8d6 each (pseudopods)","Diet":"Omnivore","Frequency":"Very rare","Hit Dice":"10","Intelligence":"Average (8)","Magic Resistance":"Nil","Morale":"Elite (13)","Movement":"8","No. Appearing":"1d4","No. of Attacks":"6","Organization":"Solitary","Size":"M-L (6-10' across)","Special Attacks":"See below","Special Defenses":"Nil","THAC0":"11","Treasure":"Nil","XP Value":"8,000"}},"title":"Scamille"},"sources":["2501"],"statblock_names":[],"title":"Scamille","prev_key":"sacrol","next_key":"shapeshi","catelog_book":"2501","catelog_setting":"ms","monster_path":"/catalog/ms/2501/scamille"}},"staticQueryHashes":[],"slicesMap":{}}
