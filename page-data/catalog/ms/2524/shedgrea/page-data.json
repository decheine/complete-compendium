The avatar of the Immortal Idu appears as a greater shedu to his <a href=\"/appendix/enduk\">enduk</a> servants. The greater shedu avatar is very similar in appearance to other greater shedu. It has a powerful, stocky equine body with short, powerful feathered wings. It has a large, vaguely dwarven head with a bristly, curly beard and mustache.</p><p>All shedu wear a simple headband made of braided cloth or rope, with a single button indicating the wearer's status. The greater shedu avatar of Idu wears a glowing diamond.</p><p>In addition to the language of the enduks, the greater shedu avatar of Idu speaks <a href=\"/appendix/lammasu\">lammasu</a>, shedu, common, and all human and demihuman tongues. It can also speak telepathically with animals, monsters, and even plants.</p><p>The greater shedu avatar wanders the Prime Material, Astral, and Ethereal planes. It furthers the cause of law and goodness, helps allied creatures in need, and combats evil.</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Combat:</b> The physical attacks of the greater shedu avatar are powerful blows with the forehooves. However, the avatar prefers to use its spell-like powers if possible.</p><p>The greater shedu avatar has the following abilities related to the mage or priest spells of the same name (where applicable, all abilities are considered 20th level):</p><ul><li>radiates constant <i>protection from evil</i> within a 30' radius</li><li>becomes ethereal or invisible at will</li><li>travels through the Astral or Ethereal planes at will</li><li>can use following abilities once per day: <i>clairaudience</i>, <i>clairvoyance</i>, <i>detect evil</i>, <i>detect magic</i>, <i>disintegrate</i>, <i>domination</i>, <i>foresight</i>, <i>hypnosis</i>, <i>improved invisibility</i>, <i>know alignment</i>, <i>major creation</i>, <i>mass domination</i>, <i>mind bar</i>, <i>plane shift</i>, <i>quest</i>, <i>suggestion</i>, <i>shape change</i>, <i>telekinesis</i>, <i>teleport without error</i>, and <i>wish</i></li></ul><p>The greater shedu avatar also has the spell-casting abilities of a 20th level priest.</p><p>The avatar can discern many details about a person or creature merely by touching an item that belongs to that creature. It can discern the race, sex, age, alignment, and some personal background of the item's owner.</p><p>In addition to its formidable magic resistance, the avatar is immune to acid, cold, electrical, fire, and poison attacks. It is also immune to all illusions, charms, and other mind-affecting spells.</p><p>The greater shedu avatar will attack <a href=\"/appendix/utukku\">utukku</a> or <a href=\"/appendix/manscorn\">manscorpions</a> if the opportunity presents itself. It is a known fact that the greater shedu avatar of Idu and the extraplanar utukku are eternal enemies, but no one outside the high enduk temples is quite sure of the reasons.</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Habitat/Society:</b> The greater shedu avatar of Idu wanders the Arm of the Immortals, primarily concerned with protecting and furthering the enduk society. It is friendly with most sentient creatures.</p><p>The avatar rarely appears, usually only if Idu has some great task or warning to give to the enduks.</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Ecology:</b> The avatar attempts to have very little impact on the world's ecology.</p><p></p><br clear=\"all\" style=\"clear:both; height:0;\">\r\n","images":["<img src=\"grf/rs.gif\" width=\"150\" height=\"75\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Red Steel (Mystara)\" title=\"Red Steel (Mystara)\" align=\"right\">","<img src=\"img/shedgrea.gif\" alt=\"Shedu, Greater (Savage Coast)\" title=\"Shedu, Greater (Savage Coast)\" border=\"0\" width=\"300\" height=\"360\" style=\"text-align:right;\" align=\"right\">","<img src=\"grf/add2_01.gif\" width=\"200\" height=\"56\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Advanced Dungeons & Dragons 2nd Edition\">"],"setting":"Red Steel (Mystara)","statblock":{"Shedu, Greater (Savage Coast)":{"Activity Cycle":"Any","Alignment":"Lawful good","Armor Class":"-2","Climate/Terrain":"Any","Damage/Attack":"4d6/4d6","Diet":"Herbivore","Frequency":"Unique","Hit Dice":"20 (160 hp)","Intelligence":"Supra-Genius (20)","Magic Resistance":"95%","Morale":"Fearless (20)","Movement":"18, Fl 36 (B)","No. Appearing":"Unique","No. of Attacks":"2 (front hooves)","Organization":"Leader","Size":"L (6' high at shoulder)","Special Attacks":"See below","Special Defenses":"See below","THAC0":"3","Treasure":"Nil","XP Value":"22,000"}},"title":"Shedu, Greater (Savage Coast)"},"sources":["2524"],"statblock_names":[],"title":"Shedu, Greater (Savage Coast)","prev_key":"rayfores","next_key":"shimfish","catelog_book":"2524","catelog_setting":"ms","monster_path":"/catalog/ms/2524/shedgrea"}},"staticQueryHashes":[],"slicesMap":{}}
