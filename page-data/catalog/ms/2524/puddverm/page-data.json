The Red Curse has affected these colonies, imbuing them with the ability to act together as one creature.</p><p>The vermilion pudding glows with an eerie internal red light. It usually takes the form of a red-tinged amorphous blob, and like other puddings, it can change shape rapidly and flow through almost any opening. The pudding is extremely sticky and tarlike.</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Combat:</b> In order to determine if something is edible, the vermilion pudding can sense heat and vibration from a distance of up to 90 feet. The vermilion pudding will even attack undead creatures that have organic matter in their bodies. The puddings count as +2 magical weapons for the purpose of eating undead or magical flesh.</p><p>Vermilion puddings prefer to attack Legacy-using creatures and will attack Inheritors before attacking those with a single Legacy.</p><p>Like all <a href=\"/appendix/pudddead\">deadly puddings</a>, the vermilion pudding is immune to acid, cold, and poison. <i>Lightning bolts</i> and weapon attacks cause them to divide into smaller puddings, each able to attack as an individual pudding. Fire causes normal damage, as do <i>magic missiles</i>. Vermilion puddings can squeeze through very small cracks (such as the chinks and gaps in armor) and can travel on ceilings and walls.</p><p>All vermilion puddings are at least three feet in diameter. They have hit points in proportion to their size, roughly according to the following:</p><table class=\"ip\"><tr class=\"bk\"><th>Diameter</th><th>Hit Points</th></tr><tr><td>3'</td><td>30</td></tr><tr><td>4'</td><td>40</td></tr><tr><td>5'</td><td>50</td></tr><tr><td>6'</td><td>60</td></tr><tr><td>7'</td><td>70</td></tr><tr><td>8'</td><td>80</td></tr></table><p>The attack mode of the rapacious vermilion pudding is similar to that of the vermilia infection, except much faster. The pudding causes 1 point of damage the first round, 2 points the second round, 4 points the third round, 8 the fourth, (etc.). If the pudding successfully hits an opponent once, it automatically succeeds each subsequent round until it is destroyed.</p><p>Armor provides little protection from the vermilion pudding's attack since the pudding only has to touch its victim. All of its victims have a base of AC 10, although magical armor bonuses, magical protection such as a ring of protection, and dexterity bonuses are still applicable. Any form of metal armor will hold off the vermilion pudding for one round before the pudding finds a hole or a chink in the armor to flow through. The vermilion pudding does not eat the armor itself; it simply flows past it to get at the flesh beneath.</p><p>The vermilion pudding is mindless and will never retreat as long as there remains flesh to be eaten.</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Ecology:</b> Vermilion puddings reproduce by fission. If a vermilion pudding reaches eight feet in diameter, it will split into two separate four-foot diameter puddings. They adapt to live in a wide variety of climates.</p>\n","images":["<img src=\"grf/rs.gif\" width=\"150\" height=\"75\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Red Steel (Mystara)\" title=\"Red Steel (Mystara)\" align=\"right\">","<img src=\"img/puddverm.gif\" alt=\"Pudding, Vermilion\" title=\"Pudding, Vermilion\" border=\"0\" width=\"300\" height=\"360\" style=\"text-align:right;\" align=\"right\">","<img src=\"grf/add2_01.gif\" width=\"200\" height=\"56\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Advanced Dungeons & Dragons 2nd Edition\">"],"setting":"Red Steel (Mystara)","statblock":{"Pudding, Vermilion":{"Activity Cycle":"Any","Alignment":"Nil","Armor Class":"6","Climate/Terrain":"Any","Damage/Attack":"See below","Diet":"Carnivore","Frequency":"Rare","Hit Dice":"10","Intelligence":"Non (0)","Magic Resistance":"Nil","Morale":"Special","Movement":"6","No. Appearing":"1","No. of Attacks":"1","Organization":"Solitary","Size":"S-L (3-8' diameter)","Special Attacks":"Nil","Special Defenses":"Immune to acid, cold, and poison","THAC0":"11","Treasure":"Nil","XP Value":"4,000"}},"title":"Pudding, Vermilion"},"sources":["2524"],"statblock_names":[],"title":"Pudding, Vermilion","prev_key":"plansaco","next_key":"rakasta","catelog_book":"2524","catelog_setting":"ms","monster_path":"/catalog/ms/2524/puddverm"}},"staticQueryHashes":[],"slicesMap":{}}
