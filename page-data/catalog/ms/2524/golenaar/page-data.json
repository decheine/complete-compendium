The na�ruk is usually fashioned of gleaming bronze with extremely lifelike workmanship. Na�ruks stand dormant and still most of the time, appearing as statues. When active, however, a na�ruk's eyes glow a soft green color.</p><p>The na�ruks give the enduks the ability to rapidly reposition troops and support personnel. During a special religious ceremony, up to 10 enduk warriors or clerics of the same faith may meld (as per the Meld Legacy) into this golem and use it as a long range transportation device. While melded, all occupants remain unconscious, vulnerable only to things that damage the na�ruk. The na�ruk then flies back to its temple of origin after releasing all of its occupants.</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Combat:</b> Like most other golems, a na�ruk is merely able to execute fairly detailed, linear instructions. They have difficulty handling conditional instructions.</p><p>A na�ruk has a Strength of 23 for purposes of breaking or pulling things, and opponents require +2 or better magical weapons to hit a na�ruk. The na�ruk is immune to most spells. A <i>gust of wind</i> spell <i>slows</i> the na�ruk for 1d4 rounds, and it ignores all other spells.</p><p>If the na�ruk gets a flying start of at least 60 feet, it charges, inflicting double damage. Na�ruks count as +2 weapons for purposes of hitting creatures struck only by magical weapons.Na�ruks do not normally participate in battles, but they will defend themselves if attacked. These sacred creatures are reserved for holy wars. They will, however, attack creatures interfering with their goals. If necessary, a na�ruk can release some or all of its occupants to assist in defense. If destroyed, a na�ruk instantly releases all of its melded occupants.</p><p>Damage to the na�ruk may only be healed at its home temple. Repairing a na�ruk requires a <i>produce fire</i> spell and costs 100 gp in materials per hit point of damage repaired.</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Habitat/Society:</b> Most enduk temples keep at least one of these constructs as a guardian. Part of the duty of the enduk clergy is to keep the na�ruk in top-notch operating condition. Many a neophyte enduk priest has spent countless hours hand-polishing the gleaming bronze flanks of the temple na�ruk, learning humility, perseverance, and the honor of a task well-done.</p><p>Many enduks believe that the spiritual condition of the temple and the physical condition of the temple na�ruk are linked. To them, a shiny, well-maintained na�ruk indicates a healthy temple. Likewise, a na�ruk with a bit of tarnish or a hitch in its step indicates corruption in the temple.</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Ecology:</b> The na�ruk is a golem, a magical construct. As such, it plays no part in the world's ecology. A na�ruk does not eat, sleep, or drink, and &ldquo;lives&rdquo; only until its body is destroyed.</p><p>Only the enduk priests know the secret of constructing a na�ruk. It requires raw materials worth 40,000 gp and vestments worth 20,000 gp (which are not consumed) and requires a head priest of 16th level or higher. The head priest must have at least eight assistant priests, each of 8th level or higher. The ritual must be performed in a consecrated enduk temple.</p><br clear=\"all\" style=\"clear:both; height:0;\">\r\n","images":["<img src=\"grf/rs.gif\" width=\"150\" height=\"75\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Red Steel (Mystara)\" title=\"Red Steel (Mystara)\" align=\"right\">","<img src=\"img/golenaar.gif\" alt=\"Golem, Na�ruk\" title=\"Golem, Na�ruk\" border=\"0\" width=\"300\" height=\"360\" style=\"text-align:right;\" align=\"right\">","<img src=\"grf/add2_01.gif\" width=\"200\" height=\"56\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Advanced Dungeons & Dragons 2nd Edition\">"],"setting":"Red Steel (Mystara)","statblock":{"Golem, Na�ruk":{"Activity Cycle":"Any","Alignment":"Neutral","Armor Class":"5","Climate/Terrain":"Any","Damage/Attack":"3d8","Diet":"Nil","Frequency":"Very rare","Hit Dice":"12 (50 hp)","Intelligence":"Non- (0)","Magic Resistance":"Nil","Morale":"Fearless (20)","Movement":"6, Fl 24 (C)","No. Appearing":"1","No. of Attacks":"1","Organization":"Solitary","Size":"L (10' tall)","Special Attacks":"Charge","Special Defenses":"Hit only by +2 or better magical weapons, spell immunities","THAC0":"9","Treasure":"Nil","XP Value":"11,000"}},"title":"Golem, Na�ruk"},"sources":["2524"],"statblock_names":[],"title":"Golem, Na�ruk","prev_key":"goatman","next_key":"golesaco","catelog_book":"2524","catelog_setting":"ms"}},"staticQueryHashes":[],"slicesMap":{}}
