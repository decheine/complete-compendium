They look like gothic <a href=\"/appendix/gargoyl1\">gargoyles</a>, thin and reptilian, with long, prehensile tails and large wings. The three varieties of abishai have different skin colors - in ascending order of station, black, green, and red. All have a vinegary smell and rasping voices. The air seems to warm perceptibly in their presence.</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Combat:</b> In battle, the abishai strikes with two claws (1d4 points of damage each) and its flexible tail (1d4 + 1 points of damage and poison; note that the poison is fatal unless a successful save vs. poison is made).</p><p>Abishai can fly high into the air and dive at their enemies, striking with both claws. They attack at +2, and a hit does double damage (2d4 points per claw).</p><p>In addition to the powers of all baatezu, an abishai can <i>change self</i>, <i>command</i>, <i>produce flame</i>, <i>pyrotechnics</i>, and <i>scare</i>.</p><p>Once per day they can attempt to <i>gate</i> in 2 to 12 <a href=\"/appendix/baatlemu\">lemures</a> (60% chance of success) or 1 to 3 abishai (30% chance).</p><p>Abishai are susceptible to holy water (2d4 points of damage per vial). They regenerate 1 hit point per round unless the damage is done by holy water or a holy magical weapon.</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Habitat/Society:</b> Abishai are voracious and evil. They delight in tormenting those few baatezu lower in station than themselves. Abishai tempt mortals bold enough to travel to Baator by using their <i>change self</i> and <i>charm person</i> abilities to impersonate more powerful baatezu.</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Ecology:</b> The abishai make up large, evil armies that fight the <a href=\"/appendix/tanarri\">tanar'ri</a> and intruders into Baator. In some cases, a red abishai may prove worthy enough to command a force of lemures. If successful, the red abishai may be promoted to a higher form of <a href=\"/appendix/baatezu\">baatezu</a>.</p><p>As part of their efforts to corrupt mortals, abishai like to bestow powerful magic on inexperienced wizards. Usually the low-level spellcaster cannot control these enormous energies, and chaos and destruction result.</p><p></p><br clear=\"all\" style=\"clear:both; height:0;\">\r\n","images":["<img src=\"grf/ps.gif\" width=\"150\" height=\"75\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Planescape\" title=\"Planescape\" align=\"right\">","<img src=\"img/baatabis.gif\" alt=\"Baatezu, Lesser, Abishai\" title=\"Baatezu, Lesser, Abishai\" border=\"0\" width=\"300\" height=\"360\" style=\"text-align:right;\" align=\"right\">","<img src=\"grf/add2_01.gif\" width=\"200\" height=\"56\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Advanced Dungeons & Dragons 2nd Edition\">"],"setting":"Planescape","statblock":{"Black":{"Activity Cycle":"Any","Alignment":"Lawful evil","Armor Class":"5","Climate/Terrain":"Baator","Damage/Attack":"1d4/1d4/1d4+1","Diet":"Carnivore","Frequency":"Common","Hit Dice":"4+1","Intelligence":"Average (8-10)","Magic Resistance":"30%","Morale":"Average (8-10)","Movement":"9, Fl 12 (C)","No. Appearing":"2-20","No. of Attacks":"3","Organization":"Solitary","Size":"L (8' tall)","Special Attacks":"Poison, dive","Special Defenses":"+1 or better weapons to hit, regeneration","THAC0":"17","Treasure":"Nil","XP Value":"7,000"},"Green":{"Activity Cycle":"Any","Alignment":"Lawful evil","Armor Class":"3","Climate/Terrain":"Baator","Damage/Attack":"1d4/1d4/1d4+1","Diet":"Carnivore","Frequency":"Common","Hit Dice":"5+2","Intelligence":"Average (8-10)","Magic Resistance":"30%","Morale":"Average (8-10)","Movement":"9, Fl 12 (C)","No. Appearing":"2-8","No. of Attacks":"3","Organization":"Solitary","Size":"L (7' tall)","Special Attacks":"Poison, dive","Special Defenses":"+ 1 or better weapons to hit, regeneration","THAC0":"15","Treasure":"Nil","XP Value":"8,000"},"Red":{"Activity Cycle":"Any","Alignment":"Lawful evil","Armor Class":"1","Climate/Terrain":"Baator","Damage/Attack":"1d4/1d4/1d4+1","Diet":"Carnivore","Frequency":"Common","Hit Dice":"6+3","Intelligence":"Average (8-10)","Magic Resistance":"30%","Morale":"Steady (11-12)","Movement":"9, Fl 12 (C)","No. Appearing":"1","No. of Attacks":"3","Organization":"Solitary","Size":"M (6' tall)","Special Attacks":"Poison, dive","Special Defenses":"+1 or better weapons to hit, regeneration","THAC0":"13","Treasure":"Nil","XP Value":"9,000"}},"title":"Baatezu, Lesser, Abishai"},"sources":["2118","2602","2140"],"statblock_names":[],"title":"Baatezu, Lesser, Abishai","prev_key":"archon","next_key":"baatamni","catelog_book":"2118","catelog_setting":"ps","monster_path":"/catalog/ps/2118/baatabis"}},"staticQueryHashes":[],"slicesMap":{}}
