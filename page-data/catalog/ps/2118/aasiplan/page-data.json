They are tall, commanding humanoids who have smooth emerald skin, white feathered wings, hairless heads, and eyes of a penetrating blue. Their overall manner projects strength and confidence. They can communicate telepathically with any creature within a 100-foot range.</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Combat:</b> Planetars are never surprised. They automatically <i>detect illusions</i>.</p><p>Planetars carry a large two-handed sword that only their kind can wield. This huge weapon has all the power and severing abilities of a <i>vorpal sword</i>. Planetars attack with this sword three times per round. In addition to the sword's magical attack adjustment of +3, a planetar has a damage bonus of +7 due to Strength (19), giving a total of +6 attack adjustment and +10 damage.</p><p>Planetars have the spell ability of 7th-level priests (Wisdom equal to 21) with major access to all spheres. In addition to those common to <a href=\"/appendix/aasimon\">aasimon</a>, planetars may use the following spell-like abilities: <i>animate object</i>, <i>blade barrier</i> (3 times per day), <i>commune</i>, <i>control weather</i> (once per day), <i>cure blindness or deafness</i>, <i>cure disease</i>, <i>detect invisibility</i> (always active), <i>detect lie</i> (always active), detect snares &amp; pits (always active), <i>dispel magic</i>, <i>earthquake</i> (once per day), <i>feeblemind</i> (once per day), <i>fire storm</i> (once per day), <i>flame strike</i> (3 times per day), <i>heal</i>, <i>holy word</i> (once per day), <i>improved invisibility up to 10-foot radius</i>, <i>insect plague</i> (once per day), <i>limited wish</i> (once per day), <i>polymorph any object</i>, <i>protection from evil up to 10-foot radius</i> (always active), <i>raise dead</i> (3 times per day), <i>remove curse</i>, <i>remove fear</i>, <i>resist cold</i>, <i>restoration</i> (once per day), <i>shape change</i> (once per day), <i>speak with dead</i>, <i>symbol</i> (any, once per day), <i>true seeing</i> (always active), <i>weather summoning</i> (once per day), and <i>wind walk</i> (7 times per day).</p><p>Planetars take half damage from magical fire. They take full damage from acid attacks. All planetars are immune to attacks from nonmagical weapons and magical weapons of +3 or lesser enchantment. Planetars are not affected by cold, electrical, <i>magic missile</i>, petrification, poison, normal fire-based, or any gas attack spells. They are immune to life level loss and to <i>charm</i>, <i>confusion</i>, <i>death spell</i>, <i>domination</i>, and <i>feeblemind</i> spells. Their souls cannot be entrapped or imprisoned.</p><p>Planetars regenerate 4 hit points per round. Unless encountered on the upper Outer Planes, only the material form of a planetar can he harmed. Upon destruction, its life force returns to its home plane to become corporeal again; this process requires four decades.</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Habitat/Society:</b> Planetars aid only the most powerful mortal servants of good. As a rule, characters of at least 12th level on a mission directly related to a good power have a base 5% chance to gain the attention of a planetar, plus 1% per level above 12th. Modify this chance according to circumstances.</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Ecology:</b> Like all aasimon, planetars are corporeal good entities that exist outside any ecosystem.</p><br clear=\"all\" style=\"clear:both; height:0;\">\r\n","images":["<img src=\"grf/ps.gif\" width=\"150\" height=\"75\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Planescape\" title=\"Planescape\" align=\"right\">","<img src=\"img/aasiplan.gif\" alt=\"Aasimon, Planetar\" title=\"Aasimon, Planetar\" border=\"0\" width=\"300\" height=\"360\" style=\"text-align:right;\" align=\"right\">","<img src=\"grf/add2_01.gif\" width=\"200\" height=\"56\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Advanced Dungeons & Dragons 2nd Edition\">"],"setting":"Planescape","statblock":{"Aasimon, Planetar":{"Activity Cycle":"Any","Alignment":"Any good","Armor Class":"-7","Climate/Terrain":"Upper Planes","Damage/Attack":"1d10+10 (strength and magical bonus)","Diet":"Omnivore","Frequency":"Very rare","Hit Dice":"14","Intelligence":"Genius (17-18)","Magic Resistance":"75%","Morale":"Fearless (19-20)","Movement":"15, Fl 48 (B)","No. Appearing":"1","No. of Attacks":"3","Organization":"Solitary","Size":"L (8' tall)","Special Attacks":"Vorpal weapon + special","Special Defenses":"Never surprised, regeneration","THAC0":"7 (+6 Strength and weapon bonus)","Treasure":"Nil","XP Value":"20,000"}},"title":"Aasimon, Planetar"},"sources":["2118","2602"],"statblock_names":[],"title":"Aasimon, Planetar","prev_key":"aasimon","next_key":"aasisola"}},"staticQueryHashes":[],"slicesMap":{}}
