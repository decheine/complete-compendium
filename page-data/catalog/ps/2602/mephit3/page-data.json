Some fire mephits affect a mustache, goatee, and tiny horns on their forehead, but these are always faked.</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Combat:</b> Touching a fire mephit causes 1 hp heat damage. Its two clawed hands rake for 1d3 damage each plus 1 hp heat damage per hit.</p><p>Fire mephits can use their breath weapon three times a day. In one form it is a flame jet 15' long and 1' wide that automatically hits one chosen target (1d8+1 damage; save vs. breath weapon for half damage). The second form, a fan of flame, covers a 120 arc in front of the mephit to a distance of five feet. Any creature in the arc suffers 4 hp damage (no save).</p><p>Fire mephits can also cast <i>magic missile</i> (two missiles) and <i>heat metal</i> spells once each per day. Once per hour a fire mephit can attempt to <i>gate</i> in another mephit, either fire, magma, <a href=\"/appendix/mephit1\">smoke</a> or <a href=\"/appendix/mephit8\">steam</a>.</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Ecology:</b> Fire mephits sometimes prove useful heating forges, warming bedclothes, or lighting cigars.</p><h2>Radiant Mephit</h2><p class=\"f\">Prone to non sequiturs and glazed looks, radiant mephits appear permanently, blissfully dazed by the glories of the quasi-plane of Radiance. They peer fixedly at people and say things like, &ldquo;Have you too seen the majesty of the Ultimate Light? Oh, look at that amazing reflection on your armor there! Nice&hellip; Sorry, was I talking?&rdquo; They take overblown names as do other mephits, hut never remember them.</p><p>Radiant mephits have silvery bodies that perfectly reflect their surroundings like a mirror, large black eyes, and thin prismatic wings. They have wide mouths, but their faces are usually expressionless, except during their sudden fits of crazed giggling.</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Combat:</b> Radiant mephits can attack with two claws (1d3 damage each). They can cast <i>color spray</i> once per turn at 6th level of magic use. However, unless directly attacked, they usually become distracted and forget their opponents.</p><p>Once per hour a radiant mephit can attempt to <i>gate</i> in another radiant mephit.</p><p>Radiant mephits are immune to all spells that affect or work through vision, including <i>color spray</i> and visual illusions, but they receive no saving throws against mind-affecting magic. They have infravision to 120'. In strong light they regenerate 1 hp per turn.</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Ecology:</b> Radiant mephits lack the attention span to carry out missions. They are created primarily because some powerful beings of lawful alignment find their <i>color sprays</i> (dim recreations of the plane of Radiance) soothing or mesmerizing.</p>\n","images":["<img src=\"grf/ps.gif\" width=\"150\" height=\"75\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Planescape\" title=\"Planescape\" align=\"right\">","<img src=\"img/mephit3.gif\" alt=\"Fire Mephit\" title=\"Fire Mephit\" border=\"0\" width=\"300\" height=\"360\" style=\"text-align:right;\" align=\"right\">","<img src=\"grf/add2_01.gif\" width=\"200\" height=\"56\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Advanced Dungeons & Dragons 2nd Edition\">"],"setting":"Planescape","statblock":{"Fire":{"Activity Cycle":"Any","Alignment":"Neutral","Armor Class":"5","Climate/Terrain":"Any","Damage/Attack":"1d3+1/1d3+1","Diet":"Special","Frequency":"Common","Hit Dice":"3+1","Intelligence":"Average (8-10)","Magic Resistance":"Nil","Morale":"Average (8-10)","Movement":"12, Fl 24 (B)","No. Appearing":"1-10","No. of Attacks":"2","Organization":"Solitary","Size":"M (5' tall)","Special Attacks":"See below","Special Defenses":"See below","THAC0":"17","Treasure":"N","XP Value":"420"},"Radiant":{"Activity Cycle":"Any","Alignment":"Neutral","Armor Class":"4","Climate/Terrain":"Any","Damage/Attack":"1d3/1d3","Diet":"Nil","Frequency":"Common","Hit Dice":"3","Intelligence":"Average (8-10)","Magic Resistance":"Nil","Morale":"Irregular (5-7)","Movement":"12, Fl 24 (B)","No. Appearing":"1-10","No. of Attacks":"2","Organization":"Solitary","Size":"M (5' tall)","Special Attacks":"<i>Color spray</i>","Special Defenses":"See below","THAC0":"17","Treasure":"Nil","XP Value":"420"}},"title":"Mephit III (Fire/Radiant)"},"sources":["2602"],"statblock_names":[],"title":"Mephit III (Fire/Radiant)","prev_key":"mephit2","next_key":"mephit4","catelog_book":"2602","catelog_setting":"ps","monster_path":"/catalog/ps/2602/mephit3"}},"staticQueryHashes":[],"slicesMap":{}}
