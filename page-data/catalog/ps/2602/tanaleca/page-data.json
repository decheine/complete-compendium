The type sired depends on its parentage: a lesser or greater tanar'ri fathers a major cambion, whereas a true tanar'ri fathers a Baron/marquis. In either case, the mother does not survive the birth.</p><p>Cambions are ugly and terrifying. They are humanoid, but have pitch-black, slightly scaly skin covered with pockmarks; sharply pointed ears: and mouths filled with crooked, sickly fangs. Cambions often adorn themselves with spiked armor and weapons. They can communicate using telepathy.</p><p>Cambions have ability scores like characters. The range is determined by the type of cambion:</p><table class=\"ip\"><tr class=\"bk\"><th></th><th>Major</th><th>Baron/marquis</th></tr><tr><td>Strength</td><td>17-18</td><td>18-20</td></tr><tr><td>Dexterity</td><td>13-18</td><td>15-20</td></tr><tr><td>Constitution</td><td>13-18</td><td>15-18</td></tr><tr><td>Intelligence</td><td>9-16</td><td>13-18</td></tr><tr><td>Wisdom</td><td>5-8</td><td>13-18</td></tr><tr><td>Charisma</td><td>1-6</td><td>2-24</td></tr></table><p>Charisma scores over 18 indicate the cambion is considered charming. Charming cambions can, at will, produce a reaction identical to a <i>charm person</i> spell.</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Combat:</b> Cambions have keen senses and are never surprised. Cambions use ornate weapons and armor. Many have a magical weapon (75% chance), most likely of common make (i.e. +1, +2, etc.), but 15% likely to be special (referee's choice). Magical armor is likely (75% chance), most likely of common make (+1, +2, etc.), but also 15% likely to be special.</p><p>In addition to those available to all tanar'ri, cambions have one to four of these spell-like powers: <i>detect magic</i>, <i>fear</i> (by touch), <i>levitate</i> (7 times per day), and <i>polymorph self</i> (3 times per day). Any cambion with 16 or higher Intelligence has wizard abilities. They have spells as wizards of a level equal to their Hit Dice (major 4th level, baron/marquis 6th level) and a randomly determined spellbook.</p><p>As stealthy as thieves, they can climb walls (95%), hide in shadows (80%), and move silently (80%) in bulky metal armor without penalty.</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Habitat/Society:</b> Cambions, like <a href=\"/appendix/tanaleaf\">alu-fiends</a>, are freaks and outcasts. Never accepted in human society and only poorly tolerated in the Abyss, they feel bitter and hateful towards all things.</p><p>However, their stealth and detachment make them excellent assassins. The <a href=\"/appendix/tanatbal\">balors</a> use them as personal bodyguards and advisors. Most cambions overcome their bitterness and take pnde in serving so high a power.</p><p>One in ten cambions is not chaotic evil, but neutral or even good, because its human mother was of good alignment. These wretched creatures are doomed to a miserable existence as lone wolves because they are rarely accepted by a good-aligned community.</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Ecology:</b> Evil cambions serve in the Blood War as assassins.</p><br clear=\"all\" style=\"clear:both; height:0;\">\r\n","images":["<img src=\"grf/ps.gif\" width=\"150\" height=\"75\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Planescape\" title=\"Planescape\" align=\"right\">","<img src=\"img/tanaleca.gif\" alt=\"Tanar'ri, Lesser, Cambion\" title=\"Tanar'ri, Lesser, Cambion\" border=\"0\" width=\"300\" height=\"360\" style=\"text-align:right;\" align=\"right\">","<img src=\"/img/spc/cambion.gif\" width=\"300\" height=\"360\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Cambion\" title=\"Cambion\" style=\"float:left; margin-right:.5em;\">","<img src=\"grf/add2_01.gif\" width=\"200\" height=\"56\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Advanced Dungeons & Dragons 2nd Edition\">"],"setting":"Planescape","statblock":{"Baron/Marquis":{"Activity Cycle":"Any","Alignment":"Chaotic evil (see below)","Armor Class":"2","Climate/Terrain":"The Abyss","Damage/Attack":"By weapon","Diet":"Carnivore","Frequency":"Very rare","Hit Dice":"6","Intelligence":"High to genius (13-18)","Magic Resistance":"30%","Morale":"Elite (13-14)","Movement":"15","No. Appearing":"1","No. of Attacks":"2","Organization":"Solitary","Size":"M (6-7' tall)","Special Attacks":"See below","Special Defenses":"See below","THAC0":"15","Treasure":"Z,A","XP Value":"6,000"},"Major":{"Activity Cycle":"Any","Alignment":"Chaotic evil (see below)","Armor Class":"6","Climate/Terrain":"The Abyss","Damage/Attack":"By weapon","Diet":"Carnivore","Frequency":"Very rare","Hit Dice":"4","Intelligence":"Average to exceptional (9-16)","Magic Resistance":"30%","Morale":"Elite (13-14)","Movement":"15","No. Appearing":"1","No. of Attacks":"2","Organization":"Solitary","Size":"M (6-7' tall)","Special Attacks":"See below","Special Defenses":"See below","THAC0":"17","Treasure":"R,C","XP Value":"4,000"}},"title":"Tanar'ri, Lesser, Cambion"},"sources":["2118","2602"],"statblock_names":[],"title":"Tanar'ri, Lesser, Cambion","prev_key":"tanaleba","next_key":"tanalesu"}},"staticQueryHashes":[],"slicesMap":{}}
