It is occasionally encountered on the Prime Material Plane, but only in subterranean places rich in mineral formations that form its diet (particularly favored are quartz, beryl, corundum, and carbon crystals). A crystal often attacks in order to gain these minerals. Inside an individual crysmal will be found 4d8 undigested rough gems.</p><p>Crysmals look like truncated, prismed heaps of translucent crystals. An individual crysmal tends to be of one color, ranging from pale amber through olive and into deep violet.</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Combat:</b> Because of its crystalline nature, edged and piercing weapons used against a crysmal must attack at a penalty of -4. Against blunt metallic or stone weapons, a crysmal's effective AC is 0, and normal wooden weapons are ineffective. The structure of the crysmal also makes it slow. Its faceted walking appendages (4-6) allow for only stumping, jerky movement. A crysmal attacks with a sharp, rotating appendage that extrudes from its top. If sorely pressed, the monster can shoot this appendage up to 60 feet, inflicting 1d8+8 points of damage. Thereafter, the crysmal has only a secondary appendage with which to attack, and its damage range drops from 3d4 to 2d4.</p><p>A crysmal is unaffected by fire- or cold-based spells. Electrical attacks cause only one-quarter or no damage whatsoever, depending on the saving throw. Poisons and gases do not affect a crysmal. <!--inflicts 3d6 points of damage upon a crystal, a --> A <i>glassee</i> spell blinds it for 1d4+1 rounds, and a <i>stone to flesh</i> spell lowers its Armor Class to 6 for all weapons, lasting one melee round. The creature can move through solid rock or earth as a <a href=\"/appendix/xorn\">xorn</a> does, taking one round to shift its molecular structure to do so. If struck by a <i>phase door</i> spell when shifting, the creature is immediately slain.</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Habitat/Society:</b> Crysmals live in roving packs with a clearly defined separation of duties between individuals. However, these duties are fluid, and individual crysmals may change positions freely. Psionically powerful crysmals are most often the leaders.</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Ecology:</b> Crysmals absorb stone and transform it into ordered, living matter, mostly quartzlike crystals. Sages have reported that crysmals fed precious stones develop better health, a gerater resistance to damage, and more potent psionic powers, but few can afford the handfuls of diamonds, sapphires, and topazes that the crysmals can devour in a single day.</p><p>When removed from a silicate environment, crysmals slowly starve. In extreme cases they cannibalize other mineral creatures or their own bodies, shrinking each day but retaining their form. After a full month, starving crysmals become about the size of a paperweight. They die within another week.</p><p>Crysmals hate xorn, as the latter prey on them. They sometimes ally themselves with the <a href=\"/appendix/genie\">dao</a>, as they enjoy the rich food and the freedom from fear that the dao provide. The dao simply consider the crysmals good and trustworthy slaves. Crysmals sometimes tame <a href=\"/appendix/elegchag\">chaggrin</a> with their psionic abilities, and keep them as servants.</p><br clear=\"all\" style=\"clear:both; height:0;\">\r\n","images":["<img src=\"grf/xx.gif\" width=\"150\" height=\"75\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Advanced Dungeons & Dragons 2nd Edition\" title=\"Advanced Dungeons & Dragons 2nd Edition\" align=\"right\">","<img src=\"img/elekechr.gif\" alt=\"Elemental, Earth Kin, Chrysmal\" title=\"Elemental, Earth Kin, Chrysmal\" border=\"0\" width=\"300\" height=\"360\" style=\"text-align:right;\" align=\"right\">","<img src=\"grf/tsr_sm.png\" width=\"56\" height=\"59\" border=\"0\" alt=\"TSR\">"],"setting":"Advanced Dungeons & Dragons 2nd Edition","statblock":{"Elemental, Earth Kin, Chrysmal":{"Activity Cycle":"Day","Alignment":"Neutral evil","Armor Class":"0","Climate/Terrain":"Any/Land","Damage/Attack":"3d4 (2d4)","Diet":"Petrivore","Frequency":"Very rare","Hit Dice":"6+6","Intelligence":"High to exceptional (13-16)","Magic Resistance":"Nil","Morale":"Champion (15-16)","Movement":"6","No. Appearing":"1d6","No. of Attacks":"1","Organization":"Solitary","Size":"S (3' tall)","Special Attacks":"Crystal missile","Special Defenses":"See below","THAC0":"13","Treasure":"Q&times;2d4","XP Value":"4,000"}},"title":"Elemental, Earth Kin, Chrysmal"},"sources":["2145"],"statblock_names":[],"title":"Elemental, Earth Kin, Chrysmal","prev_key":"drgkin","next_key":"elekeewe"}},"staticQueryHashes":[],"slicesMap":{}}
