Invisible <a href=\"/appendix/ray\">ray</a>fish are found in the mountains of Nehwon, and the hidden kingdom of Stardock, where they are bred as flying mounts.</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Combat:</b> Invisible rayfish are not naturally aggressive. A rayfish may be goaded to fly close to enemies so that its rider can attack, but the fish will take no action unless itself attacked. Its massive wings buffet an opponent for 1-10 points of damage. The rayfish's small mouth is useless for anything besides feeding.</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Habitat/Society:</b> Wild rayfish inhabit the high mountain regions of Nehwon and fly to lower altitudes to feed. Rayfish are solitary and flee any possible threats.</p><p>The <a href=\"/appendix/invistdo\">invisibles of stardock</a> breed rayfish in vast aeries deep within their mountain home. These creatures serve the invisibles as flying mounts and are often ridden into battle.</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Ecology:</b> Rayfish are herbivores that feed on plants growing below the timberline. Their invisibility protects them from predators, to such an extent that few on Nehwon know of their existence.</p><p>The solitary rayfish mate in the spring. The female buries a clutch of 1-6 eggs just above the snowline. Although the eggs are tough, leathery and well-protected, only one or two rayfish from each clutch successfully hatch. The invisibles of Stardock are skilled at hunting these eggs, which they take home and incubate.</p><br clear=\"all\" style=\"clear:both; height:0;\">\r\n","images":["<img src=\"grf/lm.gif\" width=\"150\" height=\"75\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Lankhmar\" title=\"Lankhmar\" align=\"right\">","<img src=\"img/rayfinfl.gif\" alt=\"Ray, Invisible Flying\" title=\"Ray, Invisible Flying\" border=\"0\" width=\"300\" height=\"360\" style=\"text-align:right;\" align=\"right\">","<img src=\"grf/add2_01.gif\" width=\"200\" height=\"56\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Advanced Dungeons & Dragons 2nd Edition\">"],"setting":"Lankhmar","statblock":{"Ray, Invisible Flying":{"Activity Cycle":"Day","Alignment":"Neutral","Armor Class":"-1","Climate/Terrain":"Mountains (Stardock)","Damage/Attack":"1-10","Diet":"Herbivore","Frequency":"Very Rare","Hit Dice":"6","Intelligence":"Semi- (2-4)","Magic Resistance":"Nil","Morale":"Unsteady (5-7)","Movement":"1, Fl 21","No. Appearing":"1","No. of Attacks":"1","Organization":"Solitary","Size":"L (12' long)","Special Attacks":"Nil","Special Defenses":"Invisibility","THAC0":"15","Treasure":"Nil","XP Value":"650"}},"title":"Ray, Invisible Flying"},"sources":["2137"],"statblock_names":[],"title":"Ray, Invisible Flying","prev_key":"ophidian","next_key":"scorpion"}},"staticQueryHashes":[],"slicesMap":{}}
