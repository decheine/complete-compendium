Humans commonly view the wolf as a vicious killer that slaughters man and animals alike for the lack of better things to do. It is believed these rumors were started by people who were afraid of its high intelligence and tenacity. The truth is that never in recorded history has a non-rabid or non-charmed wolf attacked a human or demihuman. (The chance of encountering a rabid wolf is 1% if a lone wolf is confronted.)</p><p>The eyes of wolves are a golden or amber color. Although fur colorations vary from species to species, based upon the climate they inhabit, all wolves have various features in common. They are characterized by powerful jaws, wide strong teeth, bushy tails, tall, strong ears, and round pupils. The wolves of the north exhibit colors from pure white, grey, to black, and all shades and mixes in between. The southern wolves, and those living in more arid climes, are reddish and brown in color. </p><p>The wolf is a very active and cunning carnivore, capable of surviving in nearly every climate and terrain known. They have been seen-or at least their tracks have been seen - even in the most arid of deserts, but this is a very uncommon occurrence. </p><p class=\"f\"><b>Combat:</b> Wolves most commonly hunt in packs during winter and late fall when larger herbivores (<a href=\"/appendix/mammal\">deer</a>, moose, <a href=\"/appendix/mammher2\">caribou</a>, musk oxen) are the only prey available. Wolves prefer smaller prey because larger animals require much more effort to run down. Even then, the wolves catch only the weakest or the sickest animals.</p><p>Wolves usually hunt only one large quarry per week per pack, going without food for days at a time. Wolves prefer eating smaller prey like mice, squirrels, and other rodents because they are easier to catch and they are more plentiful. During summer months, a wolf can consume over 20 mice in a day</p><p>Humans poison carrion in hopes of killing the wolves. This poisoning has been effective in some areas, but mostly the poisoning kills only the coyotes that follow the wolf packs to feast upon the carcass once the wolves move on. Man also fears that the wolf will kill livestock. This happens on occasion, but only in areas where the wolf pack is surrounded on all sides by human settlements. When this occurs, the wolves have no other prey, since the indigenous deer and other game have been killed by humans. The wolves prefer to hunt wild game, as opposed to killing cattle that requires that they enter human territory. </p><p>If a wolf or wolf pack is attacked by humans, wolves tend to run away unless backed into a corner. Even then, they attack-usually by tearing at the clothing or legs and arms-only until they have an opening to escape. Man is the only creature wolves fear, and this explains why wolves can be so hard to locate. Wolves leave an area once human encroachment occurs. This enables them to survive poisoning and human hunters so well. </p><p class=\"f\"><b>Habitat/Society:</b> Wolves, like humans and demi-humans, are social animals. They live, hunt and play in  packs-or families, as many sages call them. There is a  very strict social structure in these family groups. </p><p>Each pack is led by a male, known as the <i>alpha male</i><a href=\"#footnote1\" aria-describedby=\"footnote-label\" style=\"vertical-align: super;\">[1]</a>.  This male is the strongest and usually the largest of the  wolves. His mate, the alpha female is the largest and  strongest of the females. When large prey are brought  down, the alpha male and female are the first to gorge  themselves. Thereafter, the other wolves in the packs eat  in order of their strength. (This weeds out the weaker  wolves.)</p><p>It is common for wolves to challenge those of a higher  social status. This is a necessary element in the social  structure of the wolf pack. Social status determines who  can eat and when, and it also dictates the right to breed. </p><p>Only the alpha male and alpha female breed, but the beta female-the second ranking female, or a former alpha female-often helps in whelping and nursing the cubs. This assures the continued strength and genetic vitality of the wolf family. Many believe this results in inbreeding, which causes defects to increase. This is true, but the superior traits also become stronger. When a defective wolf is born-and survives-it is weaker than the rest of the pack, and it does not get a chance to breed A stronger wolf-one without the defect-has the opport?- nity to challenge the alpha wolf in order to breed his strong genes back into the pack. (Non-alpha wolves in the same pack assist the alphas in assuring that no other wolves in the pack breed. This guarantees the success of the pack.)</p><p>When humans or demihumans encounter wolves, these shy animals tend to scamper away in fear, looking back momentarily to make sure they are not being followed. Often the only way man knows they exist is by spotting their tracks the next morning.</p><p>Wolves prefer areas not inhabited by other predators. Their domain usually has a wide variety of terrain features on which they can play. Large rocks, fallen trees, brooks, and streams are important parts of their recreational activities. Without these features, the wolves quickly move on until they find a more exciting location.</p><p>Areas with easily dug dirt is important as well. Wolves dig dens in this soil to birth their cubs. If the same den is used year after year, the den is dug deeper each time. This instinct helps protect the cubs from predators.</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Ecology:</b> Wolves are valuable hunters in the wild, helping to keep nature in balance. In many areas, fear of the beautiful wolf has caused mass hunting and extinction. This causes a marked increase in the rodent and deer populations, which raises havoc with the surrounding ecosystems. Without man's hunting, the variations in the wolf population follow those in the deer and caribou population. When deer and caribou are plentiful, wolves are plentiful: when deer and caribou herds are smalloften due to hard winters or dry summers-many wolves starve, sufficiently lowering their numbers to balance the ecosystem. </p><p>In many arctic regions, men stake their in-heat sledge dog females outside for the wolves to mate. They believe this increases the vigor of the breed. In truth, all it does is create an animal torn between its desire to please a master and its instinct to run wild and free with others of its kind. </p><p>A few men have made contact with the wolf. This is a very difficult thing to do. Complete understanding of the wolfs language is required. This language is very simple by human standards, yet few humans have attempted to learn it or even acknowledge its existence. </p><p>Humans believe that the wolfs howl is its way of marking its territory. This is false. The howl is used when the wolf has scampered off to investigate something, and the rest of the pack has moved elsewhere, out of sight. The howl is a dire</p><p>Wolves stare down their opponents in order to determine who is the stronger. This is commonly used as a disciplinary action by the alpha male, when a lower male-or female-has done something against the social code. This glance is usually enough to make the transgressing wolf cower at the feet of the alpha male, rolling on its back to expose its vitals. This is a sign of submissiveness.</p><p class=\"footnotes\"><i>Archivist's footnotes</i></p><ol class=\"footnote-list\"><li id=\"footnote1\">This model has long been discredited, even by the biologist who originally proposed the \"alpha male\" idea, and in reality are not lead by any individual but by the general family group.</li></ol><p></p><br clear=\"all\" style=\"clear:both; height:0;\">\r\n","images":["<img src=\"grf/gh.gif\" width=\"150\" height=\"75\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Greyhawk\" title=\"Greyhawk\" align=\"right\">","<img src=\"img/wolfgh.gif\" alt=\"Wolf (Greyhawk)\" title=\"Wolf (Greyhawk)\" border=\"0\" width=\"300\" height=\"360\" style=\"text-align:right;\" align=\"right\">","<img src=\"grf/tsr_sm.png\" width=\"56\" height=\"59\" border=\"0\" alt=\"TSR\">"],"setting":"Greyhawk","statblock":{"Wolf (Greyhawk)":{"Activity Cycle":"Any","Alignment":"Neutral","Armor Class":"7","Climate/Terrain":"Any non-tropical/Land","Damage/Attack":"2-5","Diet":"Carnivore","Frequency":"Uncommon","Hit Dice":"3","Intelligence":"Low (5-7)","Magic Resistance":"Nil","Morale":"Average (10)","Movement":"18","No. Appearing":"2- 12 (1 % chance of a lone wolf)","No. of Attacks":"1","Organization":"Family","Size":"S (2'-4' long)","Special Attacks":"Nil","Special Defenses":"+1 vs. charms because of its intelligence","THAC0":"17","Treasure":"Nil","XP Value":"120 "}},"title":"Wolf (Greyhawk)"},"sources":["9337"],"statblock_names":[],"title":"Wolf (Greyhawk)","prev_key":"wolfgh","catelog_book":"9337","catelog_setting":"gh","monster_path":"/catalog/gh/9337/wolfgh"}},"staticQueryHashes":[],"slicesMap":{}}
