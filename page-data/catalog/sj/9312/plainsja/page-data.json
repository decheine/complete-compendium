Devilish little creatures that love to prey upon those weaker or in smaller numbers, the plainsjan have pointed little ears much like those of <a href=\"/appendix/elf\">elves</a>, but they have very sharp teeth and large claws for their size. Their small but stout tails are sometimes used for balance when feeding upon taller targets.</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Combat:</b> he plainsjan is a creature that thrives almost completely upon the freshly killed flesh of <a href=\"/appendix/umbehulk\">umber hulks</a>, supplementing the diet with other humanoids or creatures. When plainsjan attack, they always do so in numbers that warrant their winning. They attack in groups, biting and scratching from as many different directions as possible.</p><p>The bite of a plainsjan has a slight intoxicating effect which is easily shaken off. A successful save vs. poison, with a bonus of +1, easily eliminates its effects. The poison otherwise causes one to fight at -1 because of the slight delirium. Besides, the victim's Strength, Dexterity, Wisdom, and Intelligence temporarily fall one point for 2d4 rounds. This poison effect is cumulative, which makes these creatures dangerous opponents if not properly dealt with quickly.</p><p>Their claws are so sharp that, due to blood loss, they inflict an additional point of damage for each of two subsequent melee rounds unless the wounds are dealt with immediately. When these pests attack, they usually use all three attack modes each melee round.</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Habitat/Society:</b> These creatures live in tight family-and friend-oriented clans. These groups of plainsjan hunt and fight together. They tend to be quite territorial as well.</p><p>Plainsjan prefer to live in arid areas where water is hard to find. Currently, most are near the Anadian equator, but a few have been spotted in the deserts of Toril. This spread is due to the carelessness of spelljamming adventurers, or perhaps the vitality of some people's evil streak. Wherever they are seen, plainsjan run rampant, killing everything they can.</p><p>When these creatures breed, their progeny are always born in sets of twos-either identical twins or multiple sets of identical twins are born. The twins spend the rest of their lives together, sharing the same mates and food supplies.</p><p></p><br clear=\"all\" style=\"clear:both; height:0;\">\r\n","images":["<img src=\"grf/sj.gif\" width=\"150\" height=\"75\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Spelljammer\" title=\"Spelljammer\" align=\"right\">","<img src=\"img/plainsja.gif\" alt=\"Plainsjan\" title=\"Plainsjan\" border=\"0\" width=\"300\" height=\"360\" style=\"text-align:right;\" align=\"right\">","<img src=\"grf/tsr_sm.png\" width=\"56\" height=\"59\" border=\"0\" alt=\"TSR\">"],"setting":"Spelljammer","statblock":{"Plainsjan":{"Activity Cycle":"Night","Alignment":"Neutral evil","Armor Class":"7","Climate/Terrain":"Deserts of Anadia and other planets","Damage/Attack":"1 d2/1 d2/1 d4","Diet":"Carnivore","Frequency":"Very rare","Hit Dice":"5","Intelligence":"Average (8-10)","Magic Resistance":"Nil","Morale":"Average (11-12)","Movement":"12","No. Appearing":"2d6","No. of Attacks":"3","Organization":"Colony","Size":"S (3' tall)","Special Attacks":"Poison","Special Defenses":"Immune to poison","THAC0":"16","Treasure":"Nil","XP Value":"270 each"}},"title":"Plainsjan"},"sources":["9312"],"statblock_names":[],"title":"Plainsjan","prev_key":"oortling","next_key":"praymang","catelog_book":"9312","catelog_setting":"sj","monster_path":"/catalog/sj/9312/plainsja"}},"staticQueryHashes":[],"slicesMap":{}}
