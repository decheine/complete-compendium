The suits were meant to help the Sazaur guard against unwanted intrusion into the Hive complex. Similar in construction to <a href=\"/appendix/golem1\">iron golems</a>, these mighty weapons consist mostly of bronze with sinews of steel and other, more esoteric compounds.</p><p>Sentinels look like huge suits of bronze armor, three times the height of a man, and weigh more than 5,000 pounds. Angular and severe in design, the armor has many projecting spikes and overlapping plates. Sentinels carry huge tridents, also crafted of bronze. Carved with line after line of intricate runework, these terminate in three cruel backbarbed prongs that crackle with power.</p><p>Although it is not obvious from the outside, the helmet is hollow. A beholder can ride inside, peering out through the visor. A device in this chamber functions something like a spelljamming helm, turning the magic powers of the beholder pilot into motive force. While the beholder controls the Sentinel, it may make no other action, for all of its abilities are channelled into the armor. This is tiring work for the pilot, and it must leave the armor after 1d8+7 hours for at least eight hours of rest.</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Combat:</b> Unlike golems, the Sentinel has the exceptional intellect of the beholder controlling it. The automaton-suit has a Strength of 23 for the purposes of lifting, throwing, or breaking objects.</p><p>In addition to the Armor Class conferred by the bronze plating, Sentinels are immune to any normal weapon that does not have a + 1 or better enchantment. These constructs do not have the vulnerability to electricity possessed by iron golems, but they are not healed by fire, either.</p><p>While animated by a beholder, the suits have spell resistance equivalent to that provided by a <i>minor globe of invulnerability</i>.</p><p>The Sentinel has two basic attack forms. Its trident strikes for 2d10 damage. Also, the beholder pilot can project its power through the three prongs of the trident. The Sentinel points the weapon and projects three beams of black energy at its chosen target (maximum range 60 yards). A successful hit inflicts 2d6+1 damage: also, the victim must save vs. death magic or drop unconscious for 1-4 rounds.</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Habitat/Society:</b> The Sentinels were created for the Sazaur nation of beholders to guard the Hive. They have no life or animation without a beholder to power them. While uninhabited, the suits stand motionless, awaiting a pilot.</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Ecology:</b> Sentinels are more like armor and equipment than living things. Although they do not eat or sleep, the beholders in them do, so they cannot provide the eternal vigilance of a golem unless manned by beholders working in shifts. Only the Arcane know the spells needed to repair damage inflicted to them, so any wounds dealt them are permanent.</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Controlling Sentinels:</b> Ordinarily, only beholders can control these constructs. Optionally, the DM may allow a PC wizard or priest to attempt control of a suit by climbing inside its helmet. This can be fun for players and allows some memorable role-playing scenes. However, a Sentinel suit makes PCs very powerful, and control of the suit should be sharply restricted.</p><p>For example, using the suit may require an Intelligence or Wisdom check every turn or every round during combat. Magical “feedback” may inflict hit point damage on the occupant or temporarily reduce his ability scores. Particularly strenuous work or work over a long period may cause the suit to break apart.</p><p>Finally, the DM may say that the Sentinel suits are enchanted so that they cannot leave a particular section of the Hive. Beyond that invisible line, they simply fail.</p><p></p><br clear=\"all\" style=\"clear:both; height:0;\">\r\n","images":["<img src=\"grf/sj.gif\" width=\"150\" height=\"75\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Spelljammer\" title=\"Spelljammer\" align=\"right\">","<img src=\"img/sentinel.gif\" alt=\"Sentinel\" title=\"Sentinel\" border=\"0\" width=\"300\" height=\"360\" style=\"text-align:right;\" align=\"right\">","<img src=\"grf/tsr_sm.png\" width=\"56\" height=\"59\" border=\"0\" alt=\"TSR\">"],"setting":"Spelljammer","statblock":{"Sentinel":{"Activity Cycle":"Any","Alignment":"See below","Armor Class":"4","Climate/Terrain":"The Hive","Damage/Attack":"2-20 (2d10)","Diet":"Nil","Frequency":"Very rare","Hit Dice":"16 (60 hp)","Intelligence":"See below","Magic Resistance":"See below","Morale":"See below","Movement":"6","No. Appearing":"1","No. of Attacks":"1","Organization":"Solitary","Size":"L (18' tall)","Special Attacks":"See below","Special Defenses":"See below","THAC0":"5","Treasure":"Nil","XP Value":"14,000"}},"title":"Sentinel"},"sources":["9273"],"statblock_names":[],"title":"Sentinel","prev_key":"behomage","next_key":"slimsilv","catelog_book":"9273","catelog_setting":"sj","monster_path":"/catalog/sj/9273/sentinel"}},"staticQueryHashes":[],"slicesMap":{}}
