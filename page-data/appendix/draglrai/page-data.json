The more heinous the act, the more powerful the rain linnorm feels. Rain linnorms desire more treasure than other <a href=\"/appendix/dragon\">dragons</a> could possibly accumulate.</p><p><i>Hatchling</i> rain linnorms' teardrop-shaped scales are shiny and white. As they age, the scales grow larger and thicker, and turn gray, blue, green, or white at the creature's whim.</p><p>Rains speak their own language and can communicate with other Norse dragons, though they rarely lower themselves to do so. A hatchling has a 5% chance to communicate with all other animals, and that chance increases 5% per age category.</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Combat:</b> <i>Young</i> and <i>juvenile</i> rains are quick to rush into battle for treasure, attacking first with breath weapons and magical abilities. (A favorite stratagem of juveniles is to <i>call lightning</i>.) However, if a target appears nonthreatening, the linnorm fights with claws and bite, hoping to leave valuables intact. <i>Adult</i> and older ones hate to sully their claws, so they always attack first with spells, then assault their targets with breath weapons.</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Breath Weapon/Special Abilities:</b> The rain linnorm's breath is a stream of boiling water 3 feet wide and 90 feet long (saving throw for half damage applies). A rain linnorm casts spells at a level equal to 8 plus the dragon's combat modifier.</p><p>Rains are born invulnerable to electrical attacks, and they gain abilities as they age:</p><p><i>Very young: create food and water</i> (twice per day); <i>Young: plant growth</i> and <i>entangle</i> (three times per day each); <i>Juvenile: call lightning</i> (twice per day); <i>Young adult: lightning bolt</i> (twice per day) and <i>water breathing</i> (at will); <i>Adult: control winds</i> (twice per day); <i>Mature adult: moonbeam</i> and <i>rainbow</i> (each three times per day); <i>Old:</i> immune to missile weapons and <i>transmute dust to water</i> (three times per day); <i>Very old:</i> immune to nonmagical blunt weapons, and <i>weather summoning</i> (twice per day); <i>Venerable:</i> immune to nonmagical edged weapons, and <i>conjure water elemental</i>; <i>Wyrm:</i> regenerate 10 hp/round and <i>control weather</i> (once per day); <i>Great wyrm:</i> regenerate 20 hp/round and <i>wind walk</i> (once per day).</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Habitat/Society:</b> Rain linnorms live on hills, where they can be comfortably buffeted by wind and rain. Their lairs within the hills have treasure hidden inside many chambers. A rain stays in its lair only when the weather is pleasant. <i>Wyrms</i> and <i>great wyrms</i> have been known to control the weather when the land has been too long without inclement weather.</p><p>Rain linnorms consider all others beneath them, and therefore improper company. Indeed, the only time more than one is encountered is when a pair has mated - they separate when the eggs hatch, abandoning the young.</p><p>Rains attempt to kill all intelligent creatures that come too near their lairs. If one believes the location of its lair is known, it will painstakingly move its treasure to a new lair.</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Ecology:</b> Rain linnorms subsist on almost anything, but their favorite food is lightning bolts. They have no known predators except adventurers.</p><br><table><tr class=\"cn\"><th>Age</th><th>Body Lgt. (')</th><th>Tail Lgt.
