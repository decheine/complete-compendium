While the powers listed above are the most common, some aarakocra have different or additional powers.</p><p class=\"f\">A race of intelligent, birdlike creatures living in the deepest deserts of Athas, the rare Athasian <a href=\"/appendix/aarakocr\">aarakocra</a> spends its time soaring on thermals in search of food.</p><p>The aarakocra is 7 to 8 feet tall with a wingspan of 20 feet or more. Because of its large wingspan, an aarakocra can carry as much as 75% of its own body weight and still fly easily. An aarakocra can fly a short distance carrying a burden equaling 125% of its own body weight. The average body weight of a full grown male is 100 pounds and a female is 85 pounds.</p><p>Each wing has a &ldquo;hand&rdquo; at its midpoint, consisting of three fingers and an opposable thumb. The fourth finger forms the rigid leading edge of the wing. In flight the hands cannot be used, but on the ground the aarakocra can use its hands almost as a human would. The aarakocra's body is protected by a thin bony plate on the chest, much like a solid rib cage. Talons on its legs can be used as claws and can be retracted to reveal a second set of hands, also with three fingers and an opposable thumb. Except for the chest plate, the entire skeleton is hollow and extremely fragile.</p><p>From a distance, the Athasian aarakocra resembles a huge <a href=\"/appendix/bird\">vulture</a>. Its black eyes, set in the front of the head, provide excellent vision over a long range. The plumage is generally black with a white collar for adult males and black or brown with a smaller white collar for females. Adolescents are a mixture of brown and black. The beak is large and covers most of the head. Plumage begins at the crown of the head and is darker near the head, except for the collar. Athasian aarakocra speak their own language and the languages of vultures and other large birds. Some speak the common tongue (5% to 10% chance depending on how deep in the wastelands a tribe lives).</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Combat:</b> Aarakocra can fight in the air or on the ground. They prefer aerial combat since their bones are too fragile to withstand a solid blow from a human-sized opponent. In combat against creatures on the ground, they prefer to fly over their victim and drop weighted nets. Some aarakocra use darts to harass ground-based opponents.</p><p>If their opponents can fly, the aarakocra generally forgo the use of the net, although large groups sometimes use nets on flying creatures. Normally, aarakocra attack flying creatures with long spears, diving from above and allowing the momentum to carry the spear through the target. Such an attack doubles the damage if the aarakocra have been able to dive at least 50 feet. Only the very largest aarakocra can carry more than one of these spears, they can attack with both at once with no penalty, causing double damage on each strike. All diving attacks are made at +4 and should be treated as a charge attack. All other penalties and restrictions of charge attacks apply.</p><p>The effect of the aarakocra's nets depends on if the opponent is flying at the time it becomes entangled. Creatures on the ground that are hit by a net are entangled and unable to participate in any combat until they make a successful Strength check to get free of the net. Flying creatures hit by a net can no longer fly and immediately begin falling. If they cannot escape the net or use some magical means to arrest the fall, normal falling damage applies.</p><p>Unless victims are entangled in nets, aarakocra are cautious in ground combat. If the aarakocra outnumber their opponents they advance in a straight line and thrust with their spears. If outnumbered, or the opponents are particularly tough, the aarakocra withdraw. Victims entangled in nets are killed or incapacitated for use as food or ransom.</p><p>Athasian aarakocra are mindful of their physical limitations as well as their comparatively low psionic abilities. They do not normally initiate psionic combat. At the first sign of psionic powers from any of their victims, however, all aarakocra that have some ability will use whatever attack and defense modes they can in an attempt to destroy the threat. Large groups of is or more aarakocra may initiate psionic combat if their leaders feel they can win quickly and avoid physical combat.</p><p>In desperation, an aarakocra can attempt to bite an opponent in combat. Because of the unwieldiness of its beak, the aarakocra has a THAC0 of 18 if attacking with this appendage. Further, the birdman causes only 1d2 points of damage with the beak.</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Habitat/Society:</b> Athasian aarakocra live in tribes with 6-20 (2d8+4) members, depending on the prestige of the leader. The largest tribe ever recorded had 50 members. The tribal hunting territory depends on the size of the tribe, usually about 500 square miles for a tribe of 10 members. There are no rigid boundaries between tribes and border disputes are not uncommon.</p><p>Alignments of tribe members are similar to the alignment of the leader. A tribe that has a leader who is neutral good may have neutral good, chaotic good, lawful good, and true neutral members. A predominantly evil tribe does not recognize boundaries with other tribes and treats other tribes as inferior beings to be eliminated.</p><p>Athasian aarakocra aren't happy in enclosed spaces, but they they take refuge in a cave or building if necessary.</p><p>Nonevil tribes live in rocky aeries in the highest peaks they can find. Evil tribes are normally nomadic and use an aerie made by another tribe if they need to remain in an area for a long time, even if they have to evict the tribe that made the nest.</p><p>Aarakocra aren't friendly toward intruders in their territory, especially caravans. They try to extract a toll from the caravan for passage through the desert. Good-aligned tribes allow unhindered passage of caravans that pay a tribute. If someone refuses to pay the tribute, the aarakocra try to capture scouts or outriders from the party and hold them until an even larger tribute is paid. The payment may be either livestock or shiny objects. Aarakocra are smart enough not to be taken in by glass baubles instead of gems, although they cannot tell the difference between the more common gems and the rare ones.</p><p>Evil tribes ask for tribute and often attack a caravan whether it pays or not. Aarakocra always demand shiny objects such as stones. These tribes find humans and demihumans to be quite tasty and prefer them to other food.</p><p>Good-aligned tribes of aarakocra sometimes return a lost traveler to the edge of the desert after first removing any valuables the traveler may be carrying. On very rare occasions a tribe might return a lost group of travelers to the more frequently traveled parts of the desert, again after first taking any valuables as payment.</p><p>The oldest male is the leader of the tribal hunting party and has 4+4 Hit Dice. The oldest female is in charge of the tribal aerie and has 3+3 HD. In tribes that have more than 15 members, the next oldest aarakocra serves as shaman and has 3+3 HD; the shaman completes the triumvirate necessary for proper worship and the summoning of elementals. (Interestingly, no magic-using aarakocra has ever been recorded.) Tribes without a shaman cannot summon <a href=\"/appendix/element1\">air elementals</a>, which is an important part of aarakocra culture.</p><p>The shaman is the leader of the daily sun worship. Aarakocra worship the sun because it provides them with the thermals they need to soar in search of food. The shaman also leads the mystic rituals used to summon an air elemental. Summoning an air elemental is usually done only in preparation for the tribe's most sacred ceremony, the hunt. Small tribes must band together for this ceremony to allow the triumvirate to be formed.</p><p>The ceremony to summon an air elemental must be conducted at dawn and requires the oldest male and female to emit a highpitched keening whistle. The shaman conducts an intricate dance around them, simultaneously chanting an ancient summoning mantra.</p><p>The hunt is the final part of the initiation of adolescent aarakocra to adulthood and often takes the tribe far from their normal teritory. The target is always a <a href=\"/appendix/drakalsi\">silt drake</a>. The hunt is the only time the females leave the relative safety of the nest. Even an evil tribe will not interfere with a tribe on a hunt. An air elemental is often summoned to help find the drake, but never takes part in the actual combat. Although the adult members of the tribe take part in the initial phases of the combat, it is the initiates who deliver the final, killing blows to me drake. Scars from the hunt are considered a mark of pride among all aarakocra.</p><p>The females spend about eight months of the year incubating their eggs. Athasian aarakocra mate for life and a pair normally produces as many as 10 offspring. A female lays one egg a year. Constant incubation is not required because of the high daytime temperatures, so the females can maintain the nest and keep the tribe's treasure in order.</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Ecology:</b> Athasian aarakocra are high on the food chain and have no natural enemies other than <a href=\"/appendix/drakatha\">drakes</a>. Unless evil, aarakocra leave their own territory only to hunt the silt drake and return as soon as possible when the hunt is over. (Evil aarakocra attack others, as noted above.) Aarakocra eggs and hatchlings are sought after by wealthy land owners who wish to use the creatures as scouts and sentries. An egg can bring as much as 10 cp in Tyr's marketplace. Tribes that have had eggs or hatchlings stolen have long memories and sometimes take revenge against the thief at a later date. Captive aarakocra join any tribe they come in contact with.</p><p>Athasian aarakocra have a natural life span of 21-30 years.</p><p></p><br clear=\"all\" style=\"clear:both; height:0;\">\r\n","images":["<img src=\"grf/ds.gif\" width=\"150\" height=\"75\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Dark Sun\" title=\"Dark Sun\" align=\"right\">","<img src=\"img/aarakath.gif\" alt=\"Aarakocra (Athas)\" title=\"Aarakocra (Athas)\" border=\"0\" width=\"300\" height=\"360\" style=\"text-align:right;\" align=\"right\">","<img src=\"grf/add2_01.gif\" width=\"200\" height=\"56\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Advanced Dungeons & Dragons 2nd Edition\">"],"setting":"Dark Sun","statblock":{"Aarakocra (Athas)":{"Activity Cycle":"Day","Alignment":"Any","Armor Class":"7","Climate/Terrain":"Deep desert","Damage/Attack":"1d3/1d3 or by weapon","Diet":"Carnivore","Frequency":"Rare","Hit Dice":"2+2","Intelligence":"Average (8-10)","Magic Resistance":"Nil","Morale":"Steady (11)","Movement":"6, Fl 36 (C)","No. Appearing":"1d10","No. of Attacks":"2","Organization":"Tribal","Size":"M (20'+ wingspan)","Special Attacks":"Nil","Special Defenses":"Nil","THAC0":"17","Treasure":"Varies","XP Value":"65"}},"title":"Aarakocra (Athas)"},"sources":["2433"],"statblock_names":[],"title":"Aarakocra (Athas)","prev_key":"zygraat","next_key":"aarakocr","monster_path":"/appendix/aarakath"}}},"pageContext":{"monster_key":"magman","monster_data":{"TSR":["2600"],"fullBody":"  <table cellspacing=\"0\" cellpadding=\"0\"><tr><th>Climate/Terrain:</th><td>Paraelemental Plane of Magma</td></tr><tr><th>Frequency:</th><td>Very rare</td></tr><tr><th>Organization:</th><td>Tribal</td></tr><tr><th>Activity Cycle:</th><td>Elemental</td></tr><tr><th>Diet:</th><td>Low</td></tr><tr><th>Intelligence:</th><td>Nil</td></tr><tr><th>Treasure:</th><td>Chaotic neutral</td></tr><tr><th>Alignment:</th><td>Any</td></tr><tr><th>No. Appearing:</th><td>2d12</td></tr><tr><th>Armor Class:</th><td>6</td></tr><tr><th>Movement:</th><td>9 (6)</td></tr><tr><th>Hit Dice:</th><td>2</td></tr><tr><th>THAC0:</th><td>19</td></tr><tr><th>No. of Attacks:</th><td>1</td></tr><tr><th>Damage/Attack:</th><td>3d8</td></tr><tr><th>Special Attacks:</th><td>Combustion touch</td></tr><tr><th>Special Defenses:</th><td>+1 or better weapon needed to hit; immune to fire-based attacks</td></tr><tr><th>Magic Resistance:</th><td>Nil</td></tr><tr><th>Size:</th><td>S (3' tall)</td></tr><tr><th>Morale:</th><td>Unsteady (7)</td></tr><tr><th>XP Value:</th><td>120</td></tr></table><p class=\"f\">Magmen are creatures of the Paraelemental Plane of Magma. They stand 3 feet tall and are glowing, humanoid creatures, much like fire-cloaked <a href=\"/appendix/gnome\">gnomes</a> or <a href=\"/appendix/goblin\">goblins</a>. Small puffs of flame constantly burst from their skin, as if they are perspiring kerosene that ignites when enough accumulates. Magmen radiate heat like small bonfires, rendering the area near them quite uncomfortable to most nonfire-loving creatures. Their faces are almost always twisted with malicious glee.</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Combat:</b> Magmen are not really interested in fighting, but they are capricious little creatures who cause havoc by their very natures. Whenever they encounter an unfamiliar creature, which - their being from the plane of Magma - is almost anything else, they try to set it on fire, just for fun. Perhaps they do not understand that others fear their flames, or perhaps they do and don't care. Any attempt to reason them out of this course of action is almost certainly doomed to fail. At best, a creature might bribe them off with another target or a choice bit of burning food.</p><p>In combat, they attack simply with a touch. Their flaming fingers ignite the flammable items (clothing, hair, etc.) of any creature they hit, inflicting 1d8 points of damage per round for 1d4 + 2 rounds. Note that extraordinarily flammable carried items - flasks of oil and the like - must successfully save vs. normal fire or they, too, will ignite and cause their own, additional damage. This check is made once per round until the flames are out or the victim discards the item. Also, combustible magical items (scrolls, etc.) must make their own successful saving throws or be destroyed. Again, the check is made once each round unless the item is discarded.</p><p>Magmen aren't fighters and, if attacked and actually hurt, their first choice is to run away - not too far away, but far enough to be out of immediate danger. Once safe, they are curious and foolish enough to return. If cornered, magmen will defend themselves, striking with a molten fist and inflicting 3d8 points of damage upon a successful hit. Fire-resistant creatures, including those protected by magic, suffer only half damage from such an attack.</p><p>Magmen are not easy to hurt, however. A weapon of +1 or better enchantment is required to hit them. In addition, weapons of less than +2 enchantment must save vs. magical fire upon every successful hit. If the save is failed, the weapon melts into useless slag. Not surprisingly, magmen are immune to all fire-based attacks. Conversely, cold-based attacks inflict double damage and prompt morale checks.</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Habitat/Society:</b> Magmen are creatures of the Paraelemental Plane of Magma, and as such they have no society on other planes. When they appear outside their own fiery lands, their sole preoccupation seems to be with having fun&hellip; by <i>their</i> standards. Magmen love flame and are fascinated with burning things. Were it not for the damage their curiosity causes, their childlike pleasure might almost be touching or amusing. Somehow, it never occurs to these creatures (or if it does, they perversely ignore it) that other creatures might actually be hurt by their actions. Having come from an environment of fire, the panic-stricken reaction of Prime Material creatures who are set afire seems merely comical to them, almost slapstick. Perhaps this is because the association of pain and fire is utterly foreign to their kind.</p><p>On their own plane, magmen live as hunter-gatherers. They band in small tribes, organized around a single extended &ldquo;colony&rdquo;. (Colony is the only apt word, for magmen have no sexes, reproducing by simple division as they grow.) Each tribe is led by the eldest magman. They scour the molten plain, looking for choice bits of flaming minerals or hunting other elemental creatures.</p><p>Occasionally, magmen pass into other Inner Planes or the Prime Material Plane through gaps created by the excessive heat and pressure of subterranean lava. These portals have a strong lure to the magmen, for the molten stone of such gaps has a different &ldquo;taste&rdquo; than that of their home. Magmen enter into the vortex to sample the essence, and they are invariably drawn through the portal and into the other plane. Some sages speculate that the strange minerals of these portals may have an intoxicating effect on the little creatures. This would certainly account for their frivolous behavior outside of their plane.</p><p>Magmen can reach the Outer Planes only if they are summoned. Their mischievous and destructive natures provide perverse amusement to <a href=\"/appendix/tanarri\">tanar'ri</a> and <a href=\"/appendix/baatezu\">baatezu</a>, and these fiends sometimes keep magmen captive in special molten pools. Magmen are sometimes summoned into the midst of enemy ranks in the Gray Waste, Gehenna, and Carceri, providing diversionary attacks in the never-ending Blood War. Militarily, they are good for little more than this, since their flightiness and cowardice make them unsuitable for pitched combat.</p><p>Magmen especially like to swim around in active volcanoes, for when these erupt, the magmen are released to engage in their favorite sport of igniting all the combustible materials they can reach. Magmen can remain out of lava or some other fiery habitat for a maximum of six hours before they stiffen and become immobile. They rarely remain away from their environment for more than two or three hours at a time, as they consider anything below 1,000�F to be uncomfortably cold.</p><p>Magmen speak their own and no other languages.</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Ecology:</b> Most sages and travelers guess that magmen eat choice morsels of molten rock, although it is possible that they absorb much of their nutrients directly through the skin.</p><p>Upon occasion, a wizard will summon a magman to fire a furnace for a magical procedure, but wise wizards return the little troublemaker as soon as the need has passed. Some are tempted to trap the creatures and let them cool, since magmen statuettes are sometimes collected as garden ornaments for the wealthy. However, imminent death makes the little beings hostile and dangerous, and more than a few city blocks have been destroyed in their attempted escapes.</p><p></p><br clear=\"all\" style=\"clear:both; height:0;\">\r\n","images":["<img src=\"grf/ps.gif\" width=\"150\" height=\"75\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Planescape\" title=\"Planescape\" align=\"right\">","<img src=\"img/magman.gif\" alt=\"Magman\" title=\"Magman\" border=\"0\" width=\"300\" height=\"360\" style=\"text-align:right;\" align=\"right\">","<img src=\"grf/add2_01.gif\" width=\"200\" height=\"56\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Advanced Dungeons & Dragons 2nd Edition\">"],"setting":"Planescape","statblock":{"Magman":{"Activity Cycle":"Elemental","Alignment":"Any","Armor Class":"6","Climate/Terrain":"Paraelemental Plane of Magma","Damage/Attack":"3d8","Diet":"Low","Frequency":"Very rare","Hit Dice":"2","Intelligence":"Nil","Magic Resistance":"Nil","Morale":"Unsteady (7)","Movement":"9 (6)","No. Appearing":"2d12","No. of Attacks":"1","Organization":"Tribal","Size":"S (3' tall)","Special Attacks":"Combustion touch","Special Defenses":"+1 or better weapon needed to hit; immune to fire-based attacks","THAC0":"19","Treasure":"Chaotic neutral","XP Value":"120"}},"title":"Magman"},"sources":["2600"],"statblock_names":[],"title":"Magman","prev_key":"magen","next_key":"magran","monster_path":"/appendix/magman"}},"staticQueryHashes":[],"slicesMap":{}}
