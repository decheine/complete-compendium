While the powers listed above are the most common, some aarakocra have different or additional powers.</p><p class=\"f\">A race of intelligent, birdlike creatures living in the deepest deserts of Athas, the rare Athasian <a href=\"/appendix/aarakocr\">aarakocra</a> spends its time soaring on thermals in search of food.</p><p>The aarakocra is 7 to 8 feet tall with a wingspan of 20 feet or more. Because of its large wingspan, an aarakocra can carry as much as 75% of its own body weight and still fly easily. An aarakocra can fly a short distance carrying a burden equaling 125% of its own body weight. The average body weight of a full grown male is 100 pounds and a female is 85 pounds.</p><p>Each wing has a &ldquo;hand&rdquo; at its midpoint, consisting of three fingers and an opposable thumb. The fourth finger forms the rigid leading edge of the wing. In flight the hands cannot be used, but on the ground the aarakocra can use its hands almost as a human would. The aarakocra's body is protected by a thin bony plate on the chest, much like a solid rib cage. Talons on its legs can be used as claws and can be retracted to reveal a second set of hands, also with three fingers and an opposable thumb. Except for the chest plate, the entire skeleton is hollow and extremely fragile.</p><p>From a distance, the Athasian aarakocra resembles a huge <a href=\"/appendix/bird\">vulture</a>. Its black eyes, set in the front of the head, provide excellent vision over a long range. The plumage is generally black with a white collar for adult males and black or brown with a smaller white collar for females. Adolescents are a mixture of brown and black. The beak is large and covers most of the head. Plumage begins at the crown of the head and is darker near the head, except for the collar. Athasian aarakocra speak their own language and the languages of vultures and other large birds. Some speak the common tongue (5% to 10% chance depending on how deep in the wastelands a tribe lives).</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Combat:</b> Aarakocra can fight in the air or on the ground. They prefer aerial combat since their bones are too fragile to withstand a solid blow from a human-sized opponent. In combat against creatures on the ground, they prefer to fly over their victim and drop weighted nets. Some aarakocra use darts to harass ground-based opponents.</p><p>If their opponents can fly, the aarakocra generally forgo the use of the net, although large groups sometimes use nets on flying creatures. Normally, aarakocra attack flying creatures with long spears, diving from above and allowing the momentum to carry the spear through the target. Such an attack doubles the damage if the aarakocra have been able to dive at least 50 feet. Only the very largest aarakocra can carry more than one of these spears, they can attack with both at once with no penalty, causing double damage on each strike. All diving attacks are made at +4 and should be treated as a charge attack. All other penalties and restrictions of charge attacks apply.</p><p>The effect of the aarakocra's nets depends on if the opponent is flying at the time it becomes entangled. Creatures on the ground that are hit by a net are entangled and unable to participate in any combat until they make a successful Strength check to get free of the net. Flying creatures hit by a net can no longer fly and immediately begin falling. If they cannot escape the net or use some magical means to arrest the fall, normal falling damage applies.</p><p>Unless victims are entangled in nets, aarakocra are cautious in ground combat. If the aarakocra outnumber their opponents they advance in a straight line and thrust with their spears. If outnumbered, or the opponents are particularly tough, the aarakocra withdraw. Victims entangled in nets are killed or incapacitated for use as food or ransom.</p><p>Athasian aarakocra are mindful of their physical limitations as well as their comparatively low psionic abilities. They do not normally initiate psionic combat. At the first sign of psionic powers from any of their victims, however, all aarakocra that have some ability will use whatever attack and defense modes they can in an attempt to destroy the threat. Large groups of is or more aarakocra may initiate psionic combat if their leaders feel they can win quickly and avoid physical combat.</p><p>In desperation, an aarakocra can attempt to bite an opponent in combat. Because of the unwieldiness of its beak, the aarakocra has a THAC0 of 18 if attacking with this appendage. Further, the birdman causes only 1d2 points of damage with the beak.</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Habitat/Society:</b> Athasian aarakocra live in tribes with 6-20 (2d8+4) members, depending on the prestige of the leader. The largest tribe ever recorded had 50 members. The tribal hunting territory depends on the size of the tribe, usually about 500 square miles for a tribe of 10 members. There are no rigid boundaries between tribes and border disputes are not uncommon.</p><p>Alignments of tribe members are similar to the alignment of the leader. A tribe that has a leader who is neutral good may have neutral good, chaotic good, lawful good, and true neutral members. A predominantly evil tribe does not recognize boundaries with other tribes and treats other tribes as inferior beings to be eliminated.</p><p>Athasian aarakocra aren't happy in enclosed spaces, but they they take refuge in a cave or building if necessary.</p><p>Nonevil tribes live in rocky aeries in the highest peaks they can find. Evil tribes are normally nomadic and use an aerie made by another tribe if they need to remain in an area for a long time, even if they have to evict the tribe that made the nest.</p><p>Aarakocra aren't friendly toward intruders in their territory, especially caravans. They try to extract a toll from the caravan for passage through the desert. Good-aligned tribes allow unhindered passage of caravans that pay a tribute. If someone refuses to pay the tribute, the aarakocra try to capture scouts or outriders from the party and hold them until an even larger tribute is paid. The payment may be either livestock or shiny objects. Aarakocra are smart enough not to be taken in by glass baubles instead of gems, although they cannot tell the difference between the more common gems and the rare ones.</p><p>Evil tribes ask for tribute and often attack a caravan whether it pays or not. Aarakocra always demand shiny objects such as stones. These tribes find humans and demihumans to be quite tasty and prefer them to other food.</p><p>Good-aligned tribes of aarakocra sometimes return a lost traveler to the edge of the desert after first removing any valuables the traveler may be carrying. On very rare occasions a tribe might return a lost group of travelers to the more frequently traveled parts of the desert, again after first taking any valuables as payment.</p><p>The oldest male is the leader of the tribal hunting party and has 4+4 Hit Dice. The oldest female is in charge of the tribal aerie and has 3+3 HD. In tribes that have more than 15 members, the next oldest aarakocra serves as shaman and has 3+3 HD; the shaman completes the triumvirate necessary for proper worship and the summoning of elementals. (Interestingly, no magic-using aarakocra has ever been recorded.) Tribes without a shaman cannot summon <a href=\"/appendix/element1\">air elementals</a>, which is an important part of aarakocra culture.</p><p>The shaman is the leader of the daily sun worship. Aarakocra worship the sun because it provides them with the thermals they need to soar in search of food. The shaman also leads the mystic rituals used to summon an air elemental. Summoning an air elemental is usually done only in preparation for the tribe's most sacred ceremony, the hunt. Small tribes must band together for this ceremony to allow the triumvirate to be formed.</p><p>The ceremony to summon an air elemental must be conducted at dawn and requires the oldest male and female to emit a highpitched keening whistle. The shaman conducts an intricate dance around them, simultaneously chanting an ancient summoning mantra.</p><p>The hunt is the final part of the initiation of adolescent aarakocra to adulthood and often takes the tribe far from their normal teritory. The target is always a <a href=\"/appendix/drakalsi\">silt drake</a>. The hunt is the only time the females leave the relative safety of the nest. Even an evil tribe will not interfere with a tribe on a hunt. An air elemental is often summoned to help find the drake, but never takes part in the actual combat. Although the adult members of the tribe take part in the initial phases of the combat, it is the initiates who deliver the final, killing blows to me drake. Scars from the hunt are considered a mark of pride among all aarakocra.</p><p>The females spend about eight months of the year incubating their eggs. Athasian aarakocra mate for life and a pair normally produces as many as 10 offspring. A female lays one egg a year. Constant incubation is not required because of the high daytime temperatures, so the females can maintain the nest and keep the tribe's treasure in order.</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Ecology:</b> Athasian aarakocra are high on the food chain and have no natural enemies other than <a href=\"/appendix/drakatha\">drakes</a>. Unless evil, aarakocra leave their own territory only to hunt the silt drake and return as soon as possible when the hunt is over. (Evil aarakocra attack others, as noted above.) Aarakocra eggs and hatchlings are sought after by wealthy land owners who wish to use the creatures as scouts and sentries. An egg can bring as much as 10 cp in Tyr's marketplace. Tribes that have had eggs or hatchlings stolen have long memories and sometimes take revenge against the thief at a later date. Captive aarakocra join any tribe they come in contact with.</p><p>Athasian aarakocra have a natural life span of 21-30 years.</p><p></p><br clear=\"all\" style=\"clear:both; height:0;\">\r\n","images":["<img src=\"grf/ds.gif\" width=\"150\" height=\"75\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Dark Sun\" title=\"Dark Sun\" align=\"right\">","<img src=\"img/aarakath.gif\" alt=\"Aarakocra (Athas)\" title=\"Aarakocra (Athas)\" border=\"0\" width=\"300\" height=\"360\" style=\"text-align:right;\" align=\"right\">","<img src=\"grf/add2_01.gif\" width=\"200\" height=\"56\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Advanced Dungeons & Dragons 2nd Edition\">"],"setting":"Dark Sun","statblock":{"Aarakocra (Athas)":{"Activity Cycle":"Day","Alignment":"Any","Armor Class":"7","Climate/Terrain":"Deep desert","Damage/Attack":"1d3/1d3 or by weapon","Diet":"Carnivore","Frequency":"Rare","Hit Dice":"2+2","Intelligence":"Average (8-10)","Magic Resistance":"Nil","Morale":"Steady (11)","Movement":"6, Fl 36 (C)","No. Appearing":"1d10","No. of Attacks":"2","Organization":"Tribal","Size":"M (20'+ wingspan)","Special Attacks":"Nil","Special Defenses":"Nil","THAC0":"17","Treasure":"Varies","XP Value":"65"}},"title":"Aarakocra (Athas)"},"sources":["2433"],"statblock_names":[],"title":"Aarakocra (Athas)","prev_key":"zygraat","next_key":"aarakocr","monster_path":"/appendix/aarakath"}}},"pageContext":{"monster_key":"rocathas","monster_data":{"TSR":["2405"],"fullBody":"  <table cellspacing=\"0\" cellpadding=\"0\"><tr><th>Climate/Terrain:</th><td>Mountains</td></tr><tr><th>Frequency:</th><td>Rare</td></tr><tr><th>Organization:</th><td>Family</td></tr><tr><th>Activity Cycle:</th><td>Day</td></tr><tr><th>Diet:</th><td>Carnivore</td></tr><tr><th>Intelligence:</th><td>Animal (1)</td></tr><tr><th>Treasure:</th><td>C</td></tr><tr><th>Alignment:</th><td>Neutral</td></tr><tr><th>No. Appearing:</th><td>1-2</td></tr><tr><th>Armor Class:</th><td>6</td></tr><tr><th>Movement:</th><td>6, Fl 48 (D)</td></tr><tr><th>Hit Dice:</th><td>15</td></tr><tr><th>THAC0:</th><td>5</td></tr><tr><th>No. of Attacks:</th><td>2 or 1</td></tr><tr><th>Damage/Attack:</th><td>3-18/3-18 or 5-30</td></tr><tr><th>Special Attacks:</th><td>Surprise, grip</td></tr><tr><th>Special Defenses:</th><td>Nil</td></tr><tr><th>Magic Resistance:</th><td>Nil</td></tr><tr><th>Size:</th><td>G (50' long + wingspan)</td></tr><tr><th>Morale:</th><td>Steady (11-12)</td></tr><tr><th>XP Value:</th><td>9,000</td></tr></table><p class=\"f\">The Athasian <a href=\"/appendix/roc\">Roc</a> is a huge <a href=\"/appendix/bird\">bird</a> of prey that dwells in warm mountainous regions. It is known for carrying off large creatures (<a href=\"/appendix/kankwild\">kanks</a>, <a href=\"/appendix/animdoa1\">inix</a>, and <a href=\"/appendix/animdoa1\">erdlu</a>) for food.</p><p>Rocs resemble <a href=\"/appendix/eagle\">large</a> eagles with either dark brown or dirty white plumage. These giant birds are 50 feet long from beak to tail feathers, with wingspreads as wide as 100 feet.</p><p>A roc has a very limited language, useful only to warn its mate of danger or, more likely, the presence of food.</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Combat:</b> The roc swoops down on prey, grasps it in powerful talons, and carries it off to its nest to be devoured at its leisure. The resulting damage is 3d6 per claw. Most of the time (90%), a roc carries off prey only if both claws hit. If the prey was hit by only one claw, the roc usually lets go, then turns around and attempts another grab. Once the prey is securely in its grasp, the roc flies back to its lair. If the creature resists, the roc strikes with its sharp beak, inflicting 5d6 points of damage per hit.</p><p>Should a human, humanoid, or demi-human be captured, there is a 60% chance that the victim.s arms are both pinned to his sides, making impossible melee weapon attacks or spellcasting that requires somatic gestures. A roc lets go of its prey if it suffers damage equal to a quarter of its hit points. A roc can pick up two targets simultaneously if they are within 10 feet of each other.</p><p>A roc usually cruises at a height of about 3,000 feet, seeking out likely prey with its keen eyes. When a good target is found, the roc swoops down silently. This quiet attack imposes a -3 penalty to its opponents. surprise rolls.</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Habitat/Society:</b> Roc lairs are vast nests made of trees, branches, and the like. They inhabit the highest regions of the Ringing Mountains. Rocs are not given to nesting close to each other, with a nest rarely being located within 50 miles of another nest. There is a 25% chance of finding 1d3 + 1 eggs in a roc nest. These eggs sell for 2d6&times;100 ceramic pieces to merchants specializing in rare or exotic items. The price can be twice that to a trainer or potential roc-rider. As may be expected, rocs fight to the death to protect these nests and their contents, gaining a +1 bonus to their attack rolls when defending their nests.</p><p>The treasure of a roc is usually strewn about and below the nest, for the creature has no use for treasure. It is the residue from its victims. If the roc has been seizing pack animals, some of that treasure may be merchant's wares such as spices, rugs, perfumes, or even jewels.</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Ecology:</b> As mentioned before, rocs do not lair close to one another. Such a high concentration of predators would leave the area devastated. Rocs serve to keep down the number of large predators.</p><p>It is said that roc feathers are a vital ingredient in the manufacture of <i>wings</i> and <i>brooms of flying</i>. Using roc feathers in a <i>fly</i> spell will add 1d20 rounds to the duration of the spell. Not as well known is the fact that if a mage is scribing a <i>fly</i> spell on a scroll, using a perfect roc feather will allow him to double the number of spells that may be scribed with the same amount of ink. (A roc slain in combat usually has no more than 1d20 perfect feathers left, for they must be undamaged and perfectly clean to serve this purpose.)</p><p>Rocs are occasionally tamed and used as mounts. The following section details this practice.</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Becoming a Roc-rider</b></p>  <p class=\"ni\">The preferred method for capturing a live roc is to stake out a large animal, probably an erdlu. Huge nets are hidden from sight, either magically or covered with sand. When the roc swoops down to grasp its prey, the nets are thrown over the roc, usually by means of attached ballista bolts, or, again, with magical aid. A netted roc struggles until it realizes it cannot fly, then it gives up. For purposes of tearing its way free of a net, a roc has a strength of 24, giving it a 95% chance to tear through an ordinary net. Therefore, the nets used must be very strong. A reinforced net with at least 1&rdquo; thick ropes lowers the rocs chance to break free to only 60%. A net made entirely of <a href=\"/appendix/chathran\">cha'thrang</a> lines works the best, giving the roc only a 40% chance to tear free. The amount of line required makes this type of net very difficult to acquire. Since the rocs have such good eyesight, concealment of the net and captors must be total. Unless the would-be captors are magically or psionically hidden, the roc receives a normal surprise roll. Unless it is surprised, it has detected something wrong and flies off to find other prey.</p><p>Another option, hatching and raising a roc, is time consuming and expensive. A roc egg must be kept warm and dry. The incubation period for a roc egg is three months, and it is up to the DM to decide how close the egg was to hatching when it was found. Once hatched, the baby bird is 5 feet long, with stubby wings spreading out to about 13 feet. The bird is voraciously hungry, and many a careless trainer has become his birds first meal. The chick must be fed at least four large animals a day; rocs seem to do best on erdlus. This continues for a year. During this time the roc must be fed only by one person, and that person must spend several hours a day (usually after feedings), talking to and &ldquo;bonding&rdquo; with the chick. After a year of this, the roc is ready to fly, and its training can begin. Such chicks &ldquo;bond&rdquo; to their trainers, never allowing anyone to ride them unless the trainer is present. Only the trainer can control the bird. A bonded roc fights to the death for its owner, even at only six months of age.</p><p>Difficult as it is, capturing or hatching a live roc is the easy part. Once captured, the roc must be trained. The would-be trainer had better have a herd of erdlus he can spare for food as well. An adult roc needs at least 200 pounds of meat every day, just to survive. It will eat twice that much if it can, and a trainer is better off overfeeding a roc or he may end up on the menu.</p><p>When captured as an adult, a roc takes three months just to calm down. During this time, if one person brings it food, talks to it (from the outside of a cage) and in general treats it well, the roc should allow him to approach without immediately trying to eat him. Another two months of contact, feeding, and care and the roc will allow itself to be ridden, but only by the trainer. Since adult rocs do not bond to their trainers, friendship is about the best that trainer can hope for.</p><p>When it is ready to ride, a special saddle must be placed on the roc. Such saddles have straps that loop around the lower chest and just behind the legs. A saddle generally has a seat for the trainer/rider as well as space to tie down cargo or other possessions. Otherwise, a roc can easily carry 8 man-sized creatures, and some saddles are constructed this way. It is entirely up to the trainer, since such saddles have to be fitted to the individual roc. Only the trainer can do the fitting, although he can have a hideworker or leatherworker assist in the actual crafting of the saddle. At first the roc must be fitted with blinders over its eyes, although it is capable of learning to follow verbal commands.</p><p>After all of this preparation comes the time for the first ride; the roc must be mounted and released into the air. This is a momentous occasion and determines the success or failure of the whole process.</p><p>At this time the DM makes a judgement as to the treatment received by the roc, taking into account feeding, care, and general affection shown by the trainer. If treatment is exemplary, the trainer may make a normal animal handling proficiency check. (Bonded riders receive a -5 bonus to the proficiency check.) If it is less than exemplary, the DM may impose a modifier of up to a -10 penalty on the roll. Success indicates that the trainer has won over the roc, and is able to work with it. Failure means that the roc rebels and tries to escape. It does barrel rolls, sudden dives, tries to reach the rider with its beak, whatever it can. This continues for one hour per point the check was failed by. If the rider can manage to stay on for the whole time, the roc finally gives up and accepts his rider.</p><p>The fastest and most dangerous method for taming a roc is to mount a saddle on it immediately after capturing it. The roc is then released, and the rider must do his best to stay on. The battle in the skies is something to see. The ride never lasts for less than a day and may last as much as two full days. (5d6+20 hours). For the first four hours the rider can do nothing but hang on. For each hour afterwards, he must talk to and attempt to sooth the roc. The rider must have the airborne riding proficiency and must roll a successful check each hour of the ride. He must also have the animal handling proficiency, but is not allowed a roll on the skill until six hours have passed. The roll is made at a -12 penalty, with an additional roll each hour. The number of hours spent riding is subtracted from the roll, one per three hours. If/when the roll is lower than the riders proficiency score, he has broken the roc.</p><p>There are stories of riders who succeeded in staying on, or tied themselves on, only to fall asleep during the ride. Such riders are usually never seen again, for the roc returns to its home, where its mate quickly makes a meal of the unsuspecting rider. A fresh rider should have no trouble staying awake for at least 15 hours, but must make a Constitution check each hour after that. This does not apply to <a href=\"/appendix/mul\">muls</a> or <a href=\"/appendix/thrikree\">thri-kreen</a>, of course. Druids or others who can speak with animals can cut the riding time in half.</p><p>Once it has been trained, or broken, a roc can be taught to swoop and attack on command. This takes another two months. The saddle and harness interfere with beak attacks, so the preferred method is to have the roc pick something up, circle high, and drop the seized beings to their deaths. A roc in harness can attack with its beak, but it receives a -4 attack roll penalty, and the rider can do nothing but hang on. Melee weapons have little use for someone mounted on a roc, although a large lance can be a devastating weapon, doing double damage to other flying opponents or to large opponents on the ground. A gliding roc is also a fairly stable place from which to fire a crossbow. A roc can be trained to carry boulders and drop them on command. A roc can carry a pair of 200 pound boulders with no loss of speed or maneuverability. It receives a -4 penalty on its attack rolls when using boulders in this manner. Each such boulder does 5d10 points of damage.</p><p>A roc is also an excellent beast of burden. A roc with a single rider can carry a thousand pounds of cargo with no decrease in maneuverability or speed. In an emergency a roc can carry twice that much cargo, although its speed decreases to 36 and its maneuverability to E. A roc can even be trained to hunt for its master, returning to camp with its prey.</p><p></p><br clear=\"all\" style=\"clear:both; height:0;\">\r\n","images":["<img src=\"grf/ds.gif\" width=\"150\" height=\"75\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Dark Sun\" title=\"Dark Sun\" align=\"right\">","<img src=\"img/rocathas.gif\" alt=\"Roc (Athas)\" title=\"Roc (Athas)\" border=\"0\" width=\"300\" height=\"360\" style=\"text-align:right;\" align=\"right\">","<img src=\"grf/add2_01.gif\" width=\"200\" height=\"56\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Advanced Dungeons & Dragons 2nd Edition\">"],"setting":"Dark Sun","statblock":{"Roc (Athas)":{"Activity Cycle":"Day","Alignment":"Neutral","Armor Class":"6","Climate/Terrain":"Mountains","Damage/Attack":"3-18/3-18 or 5-30","Diet":"Carnivore","Frequency":"Rare","Hit Dice":"15","Intelligence":"Animal (1)","Magic Resistance":"Nil","Morale":"Steady (11-12)","Movement":"6, Fl 48 (D)","No. Appearing":"1-2","No. of Attacks":"2 or 1","Organization":"Family","Size":"G (50' long + wingspan)","Special Attacks":"Surprise, grip","Special Defenses":"Nil","THAC0":"5","Treasure":"C","XP Value":"9,000"}},"title":"Roc (Athas)"},"sources":["2405"],"statblock_names":[],"title":"Roc (Athas)","prev_key":"roc","next_key":"rockhopp","monster_path":"/appendix/rocathas"}},"staticQueryHashes":[],"slicesMap":{}}
