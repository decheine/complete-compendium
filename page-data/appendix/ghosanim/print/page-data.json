While the powers listed above are the most common, some aarakocra have different or additional powers.</p><p class=\"f\">A race of intelligent, birdlike creatures living in the deepest deserts of Athas, the rare Athasian <a href=\"/appendix/aarakocr\">aarakocra</a> spends its time soaring on thermals in search of food.</p><p>The aarakocra is 7 to 8 feet tall with a wingspan of 20 feet or more. Because of its large wingspan, an aarakocra can carry as much as 75% of its own body weight and still fly easily. An aarakocra can fly a short distance carrying a burden equaling 125% of its own body weight. The average body weight of a full grown male is 100 pounds and a female is 85 pounds.</p><p>Each wing has a &ldquo;hand&rdquo; at its midpoint, consisting of three fingers and an opposable thumb. The fourth finger forms the rigid leading edge of the wing. In flight the hands cannot be used, but on the ground the aarakocra can use its hands almost as a human would. The aarakocra's body is protected by a thin bony plate on the chest, much like a solid rib cage. Talons on its legs can be used as claws and can be retracted to reveal a second set of hands, also with three fingers and an opposable thumb. Except for the chest plate, the entire skeleton is hollow and extremely fragile.</p><p>From a distance, the Athasian aarakocra resembles a huge <a href=\"/appendix/bird\">vulture</a>. Its black eyes, set in the front of the head, provide excellent vision over a long range. The plumage is generally black with a white collar for adult males and black or brown with a smaller white collar for females. Adolescents are a mixture of brown and black. The beak is large and covers most of the head. Plumage begins at the crown of the head and is darker near the head, except for the collar. Athasian aarakocra speak their own language and the languages of vultures and other large birds. Some speak the common tongue (5% to 10% chance depending on how deep in the wastelands a tribe lives).</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Combat:</b> Aarakocra can fight in the air or on the ground. They prefer aerial combat since their bones are too fragile to withstand a solid blow from a human-sized opponent. In combat against creatures on the ground, they prefer to fly over their victim and drop weighted nets. Some aarakocra use darts to harass ground-based opponents.</p><p>If their opponents can fly, the aarakocra generally forgo the use of the net, although large groups sometimes use nets on flying creatures. Normally, aarakocra attack flying creatures with long spears, diving from above and allowing the momentum to carry the spear through the target. Such an attack doubles the damage if the aarakocra have been able to dive at least 50 feet. Only the very largest aarakocra can carry more than one of these spears, they can attack with both at once with no penalty, causing double damage on each strike. All diving attacks are made at +4 and should be treated as a charge attack. All other penalties and restrictions of charge attacks apply.</p><p>The effect of the aarakocra's nets depends on if the opponent is flying at the time it becomes entangled. Creatures on the ground that are hit by a net are entangled and unable to participate in any combat until they make a successful Strength check to get free of the net. Flying creatures hit by a net can no longer fly and immediately begin falling. If they cannot escape the net or use some magical means to arrest the fall, normal falling damage applies.</p><p>Unless victims are entangled in nets, aarakocra are cautious in ground combat. If the aarakocra outnumber their opponents they advance in a straight line and thrust with their spears. If outnumbered, or the opponents are particularly tough, the aarakocra withdraw. Victims entangled in nets are killed or incapacitated for use as food or ransom.</p><p>Athasian aarakocra are mindful of their physical limitations as well as their comparatively low psionic abilities. They do not normally initiate psionic combat. At the first sign of psionic powers from any of their victims, however, all aarakocra that have some ability will use whatever attack and defense modes they can in an attempt to destroy the threat. Large groups of is or more aarakocra may initiate psionic combat if their leaders feel they can win quickly and avoid physical combat.</p><p>In desperation, an aarakocra can attempt to bite an opponent in combat. Because of the unwieldiness of its beak, the aarakocra has a THAC0 of 18 if attacking with this appendage. Further, the birdman causes only 1d2 points of damage with the beak.</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Habitat/Society:</b> Athasian aarakocra live in tribes with 6-20 (2d8+4) members, depending on the prestige of the leader. The largest tribe ever recorded had 50 members. The tribal hunting territory depends on the size of the tribe, usually about 500 square miles for a tribe of 10 members. There are no rigid boundaries between tribes and border disputes are not uncommon.</p><p>Alignments of tribe members are similar to the alignment of the leader. A tribe that has a leader who is neutral good may have neutral good, chaotic good, lawful good, and true neutral members. A predominantly evil tribe does not recognize boundaries with other tribes and treats other tribes as inferior beings to be eliminated.</p><p>Athasian aarakocra aren't happy in enclosed spaces, but they they take refuge in a cave or building if necessary.</p><p>Nonevil tribes live in rocky aeries in the highest peaks they can find. Evil tribes are normally nomadic and use an aerie made by another tribe if they need to remain in an area for a long time, even if they have to evict the tribe that made the nest.</p><p>Aarakocra aren't friendly toward intruders in their territory, especially caravans. They try to extract a toll from the caravan for passage through the desert. Good-aligned tribes allow unhindered passage of caravans that pay a tribute. If someone refuses to pay the tribute, the aarakocra try to capture scouts or outriders from the party and hold them until an even larger tribute is paid. The payment may be either livestock or shiny objects. Aarakocra are smart enough not to be taken in by glass baubles instead of gems, although they cannot tell the difference between the more common gems and the rare ones.</p><p>Evil tribes ask for tribute and often attack a caravan whether it pays or not. Aarakocra always demand shiny objects such as stones. These tribes find humans and demihumans to be quite tasty and prefer them to other food.</p><p>Good-aligned tribes of aarakocra sometimes return a lost traveler to the edge of the desert after first removing any valuables the traveler may be carrying. On very rare occasions a tribe might return a lost group of travelers to the more frequently traveled parts of the desert, again after first taking any valuables as payment.</p><p>The oldest male is the leader of the tribal hunting party and has 4+4 Hit Dice. The oldest female is in charge of the tribal aerie and has 3+3 HD. In tribes that have more than 15 members, the next oldest aarakocra serves as shaman and has 3+3 HD; the shaman completes the triumvirate necessary for proper worship and the summoning of elementals. (Interestingly, no magic-using aarakocra has ever been recorded.) Tribes without a shaman cannot summon <a href=\"/appendix/element1\">air elementals</a>, which is an important part of aarakocra culture.</p><p>The shaman is the leader of the daily sun worship. Aarakocra worship the sun because it provides them with the thermals they need to soar in search of food. The shaman also leads the mystic rituals used to summon an air elemental. Summoning an air elemental is usually done only in preparation for the tribe's most sacred ceremony, the hunt. Small tribes must band together for this ceremony to allow the triumvirate to be formed.</p><p>The ceremony to summon an air elemental must be conducted at dawn and requires the oldest male and female to emit a highpitched keening whistle. The shaman conducts an intricate dance around them, simultaneously chanting an ancient summoning mantra.</p><p>The hunt is the final part of the initiation of adolescent aarakocra to adulthood and often takes the tribe far from their normal teritory. The target is always a <a href=\"/appendix/drakalsi\">silt drake</a>. The hunt is the only time the females leave the relative safety of the nest. Even an evil tribe will not interfere with a tribe on a hunt. An air elemental is often summoned to help find the drake, but never takes part in the actual combat. Although the adult members of the tribe take part in the initial phases of the combat, it is the initiates who deliver the final, killing blows to me drake. Scars from the hunt are considered a mark of pride among all aarakocra.</p><p>The females spend about eight months of the year incubating their eggs. Athasian aarakocra mate for life and a pair normally produces as many as 10 offspring. A female lays one egg a year. Constant incubation is not required because of the high daytime temperatures, so the females can maintain the nest and keep the tribe's treasure in order.</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Ecology:</b> Athasian aarakocra are high on the food chain and have no natural enemies other than <a href=\"/appendix/drakatha\">drakes</a>. Unless evil, aarakocra leave their own territory only to hunt the silt drake and return as soon as possible when the hunt is over. (Evil aarakocra attack others, as noted above.) Aarakocra eggs and hatchlings are sought after by wealthy land owners who wish to use the creatures as scouts and sentries. An egg can bring as much as 10 cp in Tyr's marketplace. Tribes that have had eggs or hatchlings stolen have long memories and sometimes take revenge against the thief at a later date. Captive aarakocra join any tribe they come in contact with.</p><p>Athasian aarakocra have a natural life span of 21-30 years.</p>\n","images":["<img src=\"grf/ds.gif\" width=\"150\" height=\"75\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Dark Sun\" title=\"Dark Sun\" align=\"right\">","<img src=\"img/aarakath.gif\" alt=\"Aarakocra (Athas)\" title=\"Aarakocra (Athas)\" border=\"0\" width=\"300\" height=\"360\" style=\"text-align:right;\" align=\"right\">","<img src=\"grf/add2_01.gif\" width=\"200\" height=\"56\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Advanced Dungeons & Dragons 2nd Edition\">"],"setting":"Dark Sun","statblock":{"Aarakocra (Athas)":{"Activity Cycle":"Day","Alignment":"Any","Armor Class":"7","Climate/Terrain":"Deep desert","Damage/Attack":"1d3/1d3 or by weapon","Diet":"Carnivore","Frequency":"Rare","Hit Dice":"2+2","Intelligence":"Average (8-10)","Magic Resistance":"Nil","Morale":"Steady (11)","Movement":"6, Fl 36 (C)","No. Appearing":"1d10","No. of Attacks":"2","Organization":"Tribal","Size":"M (20'+ wingspan)","Special Attacks":"Nil","Special Defenses":"Nil","THAC0":"17","Treasure":"Varies","XP Value":"65"}},"title":"Aarakocra (Athas)"},"sources":["2433"],"statblock_names":[],"title":"Aarakocra (Athas)","prev_key":"zygraat","next_key":"aarakocr","monster_path":"/appendix/aarakath"}}},"pageContext":{"monster_key":"ghosanim","monster_data":{"TSR":["2153"],"fullBody":"    <table cellspacing=\"0\" cellpadding=\"0\"><tr class=\"bk\"><th> </th><th class=\"cn\">Bear</th><th class=\"cn\">Boar, Wild</th><th class=\"cn\">Horse, Wild</th><th class=\"cn\">Lion, Mtn.</th><th class=\"cn\">Stag</th><th class=\"cn\">Wolf</th></tr><tr><th>Climate/Terrain:</th><td>Temperate land</td><td>Temperate land</td><td>Any nonmountainous</td><td>Warm or temperate</td><td>Temperate land</td><td>Non-tropical land</td></tr><tr><th>Frequency:</th><td>Very rare</td><td>Very rare</td><td>Very rare</td><td>Very rare</td><td>Very rare</td><td>Very rare</td></tr><tr><th>Organization:</th><td>Solitary</td><td>Solitary</td><td>Solitary</td><td>Solitary</td><td>Solitary</td><td>Solitary/Pack</td></tr><tr><th>Activity Cycle:</th><td>Night</td><td>Night</td><td>Night</td><td>Night</td><td>Night</td><td>Night</td></tr><tr><th>Diet:</th><td>None</td><td>None</td><td>None</td><td>None</td><td>None</td><td>None</td></tr><tr><th>Intelligence:</th><td>Semi- (2-4)</td><td>Semi- (2-4)</td><td>Animal (1)</td><td>Semi- (2-4)</td><td>Animal (1)</td><td>Low (5-7)</td></tr><tr><th>Treasure:</th><td>R</td><td>R</td><td>R</td><td>R</td><td>R</td><td>R</td></tr><tr><th>Alignment:</th><td>Lawful evil</td><td>Lawful evil</td><td>Lawful evil</td><td>Lawful evil</td><td>Lawful evil</td><td>Lawful evil</td></tr><tr><th>No. Appearing:</th><td>1</td><td>1</td><td>1</td><td>1</td><td>1</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><th>Armor Class:</th><td>0 or 8</td><td>0 or 8</td><td>0 or 8</td><td>0 or 8</td><td>0 or 8</td><td>0 or 8</td></tr><tr><th>Movement:</th><td>12</td><td>15</td><td>24</td><td>12</td><td>24</td><td>18</td></tr><tr><th>Hit Dice:</th><td>5+5</td><td>3+3</td><td>2+2</td><td>3+1</td><td>3</td><td>3</td></tr><tr><th>THAC0:</th><td>15</td><td>17</td><td>19</td><td>17</td><td>17</td><td>17</td></tr><tr><th>No. of Attacks:</th><td>3</td><td>1</td><td>1</td><td>3</td><td>1 or 2</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><th>Damage/Attack:</th><td>1d3/1d3/1d6</td><td>3d4</td><td>1d3</td><td>1d3/1d3/1d6</td><td>1d3/1d3 or 2d4</td><td>1d4+1</td></tr><tr><th>Special Attacks:</th><td>Age</td><td>Age</td><td>Age</td><td>Age</td><td>Age</td><td>Age</td></tr><tr><th>Special Defenses:</th><td>Ethereal</td><td>Ethereal</td><td>Ethereal</td><td>Ethereal</td><td>Ethereal</td><td>Ethereal</td></tr><tr><th>Magic Resistance:</th><td>Nil</td><td>Nil</td><td>Nil</td><td>Nil</td><td>Nil</td><td>Nil</td></tr><tr><th>Size:</th><td>L (9' tall)</td><td>M (5' long)</td><td>L (8-9' long)</td><td>M (4-5' long)</td><td>L (8' tall)</td><td>S (3-4' long)</td></tr><tr><th>Morale:</th><td>Fearless (19-20)</td><td>Fearless (19-20)</td><td>Fearless (19-20)</td><td>Fearless (19-20)</td><td>Fearless (19-20)</td><td>Fearless (19-20)</td></tr><tr><th>XP Value:</th><td>2,000</td><td>1,400</td><td>975</td><td>1,400</td><td>1,400</td><td>1,400</td></tr></table><p class=\"f\">Animal <a href=\"/appendix/ghost\">ghosts</a> are the spirits of woodland creatures that died under some unusual circumstance. In the case of pets, they may have been killed while attempting to serve their masters. For wild beasts, it may be that they died while in a panic or other emotionally charged state. Whatever the cause of their unlife, they are doomed to roam the place of their death, haunting those who killed them of seeking to complete an unfinished task. They instinctively hate all life and have an undying hunger that can only be satisfied by drawing the essence from those still living.</p><p>Ghost animals retain the basic forms they had while living, but may show gaping wounds, look emaciated, glow with an eerie luminescence, or appear faint and transparent.</p><p>They still bark, growl, hiss, or make whatever other sounds they did in life, although these now have a haunting, spectral quality to them.</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Combat:</b> Like other ghosts, these undead animals are incorporeal. Though usually encountered only by those in a like state, the residue of their being is visible to non-ethereal creatures and is so frightening that those viewing it must immediately make a fear check. Succumbing to this fear causes the victim to temporarily lose one point of Strength, in addition to the other effects of the failed check. Priests of 5th level or paladins of 8th level are immune to this effect and all other characters of at least 7th level receive a +2 bonus to their fear checks.</p><p>Those who do not retreat promptly upon encountering the ghost are likely to be attacked by it. After spending one round to assume a semicorporeal form, the animal attacks as it would have while alive. In this state, however, its claws, fangs, or other natural weapons will not harm the living. The ethereal touch of such an animal causes those hit by it to age 5-20 (5d4) years.</p><p>While semicorporeal, a ghost animal has an Armor Class of 0 and can be struck only by silver or magical weapons. Spells cast upon the creature will affect it normally. Semicorporeal ghost animals can be turned by priests as if they were spectres and may be harmed by holy water, which does 2d4 points of damage per vial.</p><p>When in its ethereal state, the ghost animal can only be combated by another in the Ethereal plane. If this is the case, it has an Armor Class of 8. They can be attacked by spells, but only if the caster is also ethereal.Any living thing killed by a ghost animal is drained of its life essence and is dead beyond the power of normal magic to revive. No force other than a <i>wish</i> can breathe life into someone slain in this manner.</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Habitat/Society:</b> In most cases, ghost animals are confined to a small area. Usually, this is place where they died, though they may haunt their former lair, or that of the person that killed them. Occasionally, the ghost animal's range extends to the territory the creature once roamed or claimed.</p><p>Most animal ghosts have specific reasons for their hauntings. They are prone to seek revenge on those who ended their lives or were cruel to them. They are very dangerous, as they often do not distinguish between the specific person who slew them and an innocent traveler passing through the area.</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Ecology:</b> The fear that animal ghosts engender has nothing to do with their appearance or the fact that they are dead. The fear they cause and their ability to age a victim through touch are manifestations of their supernatural power. Bravery is not enough to protect someone from their powers.</p><p>Any treasure found with a ghost animal is usually that of former victims, for the creature has no interest in such things itself.</p>\n","images":["<img src=\"grf/rv.gif\" width=\"150\" height=\"75\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Ravenloft\" title=\"Ravenloft\" align=\"right\">","<img src=\"grf/add2_01.gif\" width=\"200\" height=\"56\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Advanced Dungeons & Dragons 2nd Edition\">"],"setting":"Ravenloft","statblock":{"Bear":{"Activity Cycle":"Night","Alignment":"Lawful evil","Armor Class":"0 or 8","Climate/Terrain":"Temperate land","Damage/Attack":"1d3/1d3/1d6","Diet":"None","Frequency":"Very rare","Hit Dice":"5+5","Intelligence":"Semi- (2-4)","Magic Resistance":"Nil","Morale":"Fearless (19-20)","Movement":"12","No. Appearing":"1","No. of Attacks":"3","Organization":"Solitary","Size":"L (9' tall)","Special Attacks":"Age","Special Defenses":"Ethereal","THAC0":"15","Treasure":"R","XP Value":"2,000"},"Boar, Wild":{"Activity Cycle":"Night","Alignment":"Lawful evil","Armor Class":"0 or 8","Climate/Terrain":"Temperate land","Damage/Attack":"3d4","Diet":"None","Frequency":"Very rare","Hit Dice":"3+3","Intelligence":"Semi- (2-4)","Magic Resistance":"Nil","Morale":"Fearless (19-20)","Movement":"15","No. Appearing":"1","No. of Attacks":"1","Organization":"Solitary","Size":"M (5' long)","Special Attacks":"Age","Special Defenses":"Ethereal","THAC0":"17","Treasure":"R","XP Value":"1,400"},"Horse, Wild":{"Activity Cycle":"Night","Alignment":"Lawful evil","Armor Class":"0 or 8","Climate/Terrain":"Any nonmountainous","Damage/Attack":"1d3","Diet":"None","Frequency":"Very rare","Hit Dice":"2+2","Intelligence":"Animal (1)","Magic Resistance":"Nil","Morale":"Fearless (19-20)","Movement":"24","No. Appearing":"1","No. of Attacks":"1","Organization":"Solitary","Size":"L (8-9' long)","Special Attacks":"Age","Special Defenses":"Ethereal","THAC0":"19","Treasure":"R","XP Value":"975"},"Lion, Mtn.":{"Activity Cycle":"Night","Alignment":"Lawful evil","Armor Class":"0 or 8","Climate/Terrain":"Warm or temperate","Damage/Attack":"1d3/1d3/1d6","Diet":"None","Frequency":"Very rare","Hit Dice":"3+1","Intelligence":"Semi- (2-4)","Magic Resistance":"Nil","Morale":"Fearless (19-20)","Movement":"12","No. Appearing":"1","No. of Attacks":"3","Organization":"Solitary","Size":"M (4-5' long)","Special Attacks":"Age","Special Defenses":"Ethereal","THAC0":"17","Treasure":"R","XP Value":"1,400"},"Stag":{"Activity Cycle":"Night","Alignment":"Lawful evil","Armor Class":"0 or 8","Climate/Terrain":"Temperate land","Damage/Attack":"1d3/1d3 or 2d4","Diet":"None","Frequency":"Very rare","Hit Dice":"3","Intelligence":"Animal (1)","Magic Resistance":"Nil","Morale":"Fearless (19-20)","Movement":"24","No. Appearing":"1","No. of Attacks":"1 or 2","Organization":"Solitary","Size":"L (8' tall)","Special Attacks":"Age","Special Defenses":"Ethereal","THAC0":"17","Treasure":"R","XP Value":"1,400"},"Wolf":{"Activity Cycle":"Night","Alignment":"Lawful evil","Armor Class":"0 or 8","Climate/Terrain":"Non-tropical land","Damage/Attack":"1d4+1","Diet":"None","Frequency":"Very rare","Hit Dice":"3","Intelligence":"Low (5-7)","Magic Resistance":"Nil","Morale":"Fearless (19-20)","Movement":"18","No. Appearing":"1","No. of Attacks":"1","Organization":"Solitary/Pack","Size":"S (3-4' long)","Special Attacks":"Age","Special Defenses":"Ethereal","THAC0":"17","Treasure":"R","XP Value":"1,400"}},"title":"Ghost, Animal"},"sources":["2153"],"statblock_names":[],"title":"Ghost, Animal","prev_key":"geonid","next_key":"ghoscasu","monster_path":"/appendix/ghosanim"}},"staticQueryHashes":[],"slicesMap":{}}
