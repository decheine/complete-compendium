While the powers listed above are the most common, some aarakocra have different or additional powers.</p><p class=\"f\">A race of intelligent, birdlike creatures living in the deepest deserts of Athas, the rare Athasian <a href=\"/appendix/aarakocr\">aarakocra</a> spends its time soaring on thermals in search of food.</p><p>The aarakocra is 7 to 8 feet tall with a wingspan of 20 feet or more. Because of its large wingspan, an aarakocra can carry as much as 75% of its own body weight and still fly easily. An aarakocra can fly a short distance carrying a burden equaling 125% of its own body weight. The average body weight of a full grown male is 100 pounds and a female is 85 pounds.</p><p>Each wing has a &ldquo;hand&rdquo; at its midpoint, consisting of three fingers and an opposable thumb. The fourth finger forms the rigid leading edge of the wing. In flight the hands cannot be used, but on the ground the aarakocra can use its hands almost as a human would. The aarakocra's body is protected by a thin bony plate on the chest, much like a solid rib cage. Talons on its legs can be used as claws and can be retracted to reveal a second set of hands, also with three fingers and an opposable thumb. Except for the chest plate, the entire skeleton is hollow and extremely fragile.</p><p>From a distance, the Athasian aarakocra resembles a huge <a href=\"/appendix/bird\">vulture</a>. Its black eyes, set in the front of the head, provide excellent vision over a long range. The plumage is generally black with a white collar for adult males and black or brown with a smaller white collar for females. Adolescents are a mixture of brown and black. The beak is large and covers most of the head. Plumage begins at the crown of the head and is darker near the head, except for the collar. Athasian aarakocra speak their own language and the languages of vultures and other large birds. Some speak the common tongue (5% to 10% chance depending on how deep in the wastelands a tribe lives).</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Combat:</b> Aarakocra can fight in the air or on the ground. They prefer aerial combat since their bones are too fragile to withstand a solid blow from a human-sized opponent. In combat against creatures on the ground, they prefer to fly over their victim and drop weighted nets. Some aarakocra use darts to harass ground-based opponents.</p><p>If their opponents can fly, the aarakocra generally forgo the use of the net, although large groups sometimes use nets on flying creatures. Normally, aarakocra attack flying creatures with long spears, diving from above and allowing the momentum to carry the spear through the target. Such an attack doubles the damage if the aarakocra have been able to dive at least 50 feet. Only the very largest aarakocra can carry more than one of these spears, they can attack with both at once with no penalty, causing double damage on each strike. All diving attacks are made at +4 and should be treated as a charge attack. All other penalties and restrictions of charge attacks apply.</p><p>The effect of the aarakocra's nets depends on if the opponent is flying at the time it becomes entangled. Creatures on the ground that are hit by a net are entangled and unable to participate in any combat until they make a successful Strength check to get free of the net. Flying creatures hit by a net can no longer fly and immediately begin falling. If they cannot escape the net or use some magical means to arrest the fall, normal falling damage applies.</p><p>Unless victims are entangled in nets, aarakocra are cautious in ground combat. If the aarakocra outnumber their opponents they advance in a straight line and thrust with their spears. If outnumbered, or the opponents are particularly tough, the aarakocra withdraw. Victims entangled in nets are killed or incapacitated for use as food or ransom.</p><p>Athasian aarakocra are mindful of their physical limitations as well as their comparatively low psionic abilities. They do not normally initiate psionic combat. At the first sign of psionic powers from any of their victims, however, all aarakocra that have some ability will use whatever attack and defense modes they can in an attempt to destroy the threat. Large groups of is or more aarakocra may initiate psionic combat if their leaders feel they can win quickly and avoid physical combat.</p><p>In desperation, an aarakocra can attempt to bite an opponent in combat. Because of the unwieldiness of its beak, the aarakocra has a THAC0 of 18 if attacking with this appendage. Further, the birdman causes only 1d2 points of damage with the beak.</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Habitat/Society:</b> Athasian aarakocra live in tribes with 6-20 (2d8+4) members, depending on the prestige of the leader. The largest tribe ever recorded had 50 members. The tribal hunting territory depends on the size of the tribe, usually about 500 square miles for a tribe of 10 members. There are no rigid boundaries between tribes and border disputes are not uncommon.</p><p>Alignments of tribe members are similar to the alignment of the leader. A tribe that has a leader who is neutral good may have neutral good, chaotic good, lawful good, and true neutral members. A predominantly evil tribe does not recognize boundaries with other tribes and treats other tribes as inferior beings to be eliminated.</p><p>Athasian aarakocra aren't happy in enclosed spaces, but they they take refuge in a cave or building if necessary.</p><p>Nonevil tribes live in rocky aeries in the highest peaks they can find. Evil tribes are normally nomadic and use an aerie made by another tribe if they need to remain in an area for a long time, even if they have to evict the tribe that made the nest.</p><p>Aarakocra aren't friendly toward intruders in their territory, especially caravans. They try to extract a toll from the caravan for passage through the desert. Good-aligned tribes allow unhindered passage of caravans that pay a tribute. If someone refuses to pay the tribute, the aarakocra try to capture scouts or outriders from the party and hold them until an even larger tribute is paid. The payment may be either livestock or shiny objects. Aarakocra are smart enough not to be taken in by glass baubles instead of gems, although they cannot tell the difference between the more common gems and the rare ones.</p><p>Evil tribes ask for tribute and often attack a caravan whether it pays or not. Aarakocra always demand shiny objects such as stones. These tribes find humans and demihumans to be quite tasty and prefer them to other food.</p><p>Good-aligned tribes of aarakocra sometimes return a lost traveler to the edge of the desert after first removing any valuables the traveler may be carrying. On very rare occasions a tribe might return a lost group of travelers to the more frequently traveled parts of the desert, again after first taking any valuables as payment.</p><p>The oldest male is the leader of the tribal hunting party and has 4+4 Hit Dice. The oldest female is in charge of the tribal aerie and has 3+3 HD. In tribes that have more than 15 members, the next oldest aarakocra serves as shaman and has 3+3 HD; the shaman completes the triumvirate necessary for proper worship and the summoning of elementals. (Interestingly, no magic-using aarakocra has ever been recorded.) Tribes without a shaman cannot summon <a href=\"/appendix/element1\">air elementals</a>, which is an important part of aarakocra culture.</p><p>The shaman is the leader of the daily sun worship. Aarakocra worship the sun because it provides them with the thermals they need to soar in search of food. The shaman also leads the mystic rituals used to summon an air elemental. Summoning an air elemental is usually done only in preparation for the tribe's most sacred ceremony, the hunt. Small tribes must band together for this ceremony to allow the triumvirate to be formed.</p><p>The ceremony to summon an air elemental must be conducted at dawn and requires the oldest male and female to emit a highpitched keening whistle. The shaman conducts an intricate dance around them, simultaneously chanting an ancient summoning mantra.</p><p>The hunt is the final part of the initiation of adolescent aarakocra to adulthood and often takes the tribe far from their normal teritory. The target is always a <a href=\"/appendix/drakalsi\">silt drake</a>. The hunt is the only time the females leave the relative safety of the nest. Even an evil tribe will not interfere with a tribe on a hunt. An air elemental is often summoned to help find the drake, but never takes part in the actual combat. Although the adult members of the tribe take part in the initial phases of the combat, it is the initiates who deliver the final, killing blows to me drake. Scars from the hunt are considered a mark of pride among all aarakocra.</p><p>The females spend about eight months of the year incubating their eggs. Athasian aarakocra mate for life and a pair normally produces as many as 10 offspring. A female lays one egg a year. Constant incubation is not required because of the high daytime temperatures, so the females can maintain the nest and keep the tribe's treasure in order.</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Ecology:</b> Athasian aarakocra are high on the food chain and have no natural enemies other than <a href=\"/appendix/drakatha\">drakes</a>. Unless evil, aarakocra leave their own territory only to hunt the silt drake and return as soon as possible when the hunt is over. (Evil aarakocra attack others, as noted above.) Aarakocra eggs and hatchlings are sought after by wealthy land owners who wish to use the creatures as scouts and sentries. An egg can bring as much as 10 cp in Tyr's marketplace. Tribes that have had eggs or hatchlings stolen have long memories and sometimes take revenge against the thief at a later date. Captive aarakocra join any tribe they come in contact with.</p><p>Athasian aarakocra have a natural life span of 21-30 years.</p><p></p><br clear=\"all\" style=\"clear:both; height:0;\">\r\n","images":["<img src=\"grf/ds.gif\" width=\"150\" height=\"75\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Dark Sun\" title=\"Dark Sun\" align=\"right\">","<img src=\"img/aarakath.gif\" alt=\"Aarakocra (Athas)\" title=\"Aarakocra (Athas)\" border=\"0\" width=\"300\" height=\"360\" style=\"text-align:right;\" align=\"right\">","<img src=\"grf/add2_01.gif\" width=\"200\" height=\"56\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Advanced Dungeons & Dragons 2nd Edition\">"],"setting":"Dark Sun","statblock":{"Aarakocra (Athas)":{"Activity Cycle":"Day","Alignment":"Any","Armor Class":"7","Climate/Terrain":"Deep desert","Damage/Attack":"1d3/1d3 or by weapon","Diet":"Carnivore","Frequency":"Rare","Hit Dice":"2+2","Intelligence":"Average (8-10)","Magic Resistance":"Nil","Morale":"Steady (11)","Movement":"6, Fl 36 (C)","No. Appearing":"1d10","No. of Attacks":"2","Organization":"Tribal","Size":"M (20'+ wingspan)","Special Attacks":"Nil","Special Defenses":"Nil","THAC0":"17","Treasure":"Varies","XP Value":"65"}},"title":"Aarakocra (Athas)"},"sources":["2433"],"statblock_names":[],"title":"Aarakocra (Athas)","prev_key":"zygraat","next_key":"aarakocr","monster_path":"/appendix/aarakath"}}},"pageContext":{"monster_key":"rhuomans","monster_data":{"TSR":["3100"],"fullBody":"  <table cellspacing=\"0\" cellpadding=\"0\"><tr><th>Climate/Terrain:</th>  <td>Rhuobhe/Forests</td></tr><tr><th>Frequency:</th>        <td>Unique</td></tr><tr><th>Organization:</th>     <td>Solitary</td></tr><tr><th>Activity Cycle:</th>   <td>Nocturnal</td></tr><tr><th>Diet:</th>             <td>Special</td></tr><tr><th>Intelligence:</th>     <td>Genius (18)</td></tr><tr><th>Treasure:</th>         <td>Domain Treasure</td></tr><tr><th>Alignment:</th>        <td>Neutral evil</td></tr><tr><th>No. Appearing:</th>    <td>1</td></tr><tr><th>Armor Class:</th>      <td>6 (base); -8 in armor</td></tr><tr><th>Movement:</th>         <td>15</td></tr><tr><th>Hit Points:</th>       <td>88</td></tr><tr><th>THAC0:</th>            <td>5 (base); -2 with sword or bow</td></tr><tr><th>No. of Attacks:</th>   <td>2/1</td></tr><tr><th>Damage/Attack:</th>    <td>2d4+7 (sword) or 1d8+3 (bow)</td></tr><tr><th>Special Attacks:</th>  <td>Create arrows</td></tr><tr><th>Special Defenses:</th> <td>+3 or better weapons to hit, invulnerable to arrows</td></tr><tr><th>Magic Resistance:</th> <td>25%</td></tr><tr><th>Size:</th>             <td>L (7')</td></tr><tr><th>Morale:</th>           <td>Fearless (20)</td></tr><tr><th>Blood:</th>            <td>True (Azrai): 95</td></tr><tr><th>Blood Abilities:</th>  <td>Awareness (minor), Bloodform (major), Enhanced sense (major), Fear (major), Regeneration (minor)</td></tr><tr><th>Realm Spells:</th>     <td><i>Demagague, dispel realm magic, mass destruction, raze, scry, subversion, warding</i></td></tr><tr><th>XP Value:</th>         <td>21,000</td></tr></table><p><b>Spells Memorized:</b></p><p>\n1st: <i>Charm person</i>, <i>chill touch</i>, <i>jump</i>, <i>magic missile</i> (x2) <br/>\n2nd: <i>Blindness</i>, <i>fog cloud</i>, <i>levitate</i>, <i>stinking cloud</i>, <i>web</i> <br/>\n3rd: <i>Blink</i>, <i>dispel magic</i>, <i>fly</i>, <i>haste</i>, <i>lightning bolt</i> <br/>\n4th: <i>Fire shield</i>, <i>ice storm</i>, <i>minor globe of invulnerability</i>, <i>plant growth</i>, <i>polymorph self</i> <br/>\n5th: <i>Animate dead</i>, <i>conjure elemental</i>, <i>contact other plane</i>, <i>dismissal</i>, <i>telekinesis</i> <br/>\n6th: <i>Disintegrate</i>, <i>Otiluke's freezing sphere</i> <br/>\n7th: <i>Prismatic spray</i> <br/>\n</p><p class=\"f\">When Rhuobhe Manslayer (pronounced Rove) was a young elf, whiling his time away in the southern Aelvinnwode on the banks of the River Maesil (in the land now known as Ghoere), the <a href=\"/appendix/humaceri\">human</a> tribes began migrating to Cerilia. Though they were not always peaceful toward the elves (and vice versa), no particular animosity arose between the two species. Thus, the elves sought human aid in counteracting the rising <a href=\"/appendix/goblceri\">goblin</a> tide.</p><p>Humans and elves worked together, though not always side by side, and they learned much about each other. As the humans pushed the goblins back, Rhuobhe found himself fascinated by the newcomers.</p><p>Eventually, when the goblins were beaten, the humans began to settle the Cerilian shores. Rhuobhe thought nothing of this and even befriended a few newcomers, showing them the secrets and wonders of Cerilia.</p><p>When the humans began to abuse the forests, however, betraying the trust he had placed in them, he had second thoughts. He spoke to his friends and asked them to cease their destructive ways. However, they mocked him and sent him on his way. Bitter and angry, be joined the gheallie Sidbe, the Hunt of the Elves, and hunted humans with a fervor heretofore unseen by the elves. Still, the hunters were glad to have him, for Rhuobhe was an excellent killer, and they labeled him Manslayer for his efforts.</p><p>When Azrai approached the elves with his plan to destroy the humans, Rhuobhe eagerly signed on. Later, when the elf armies deserted Azrai upon the realization of what he stood for, Rhuobhe remained with the god of evil. Indeed, he was astonished that his fellows would desert their hatreds for the humans so quickly. As a result of his loyalty and his hatred, he was bathed in Azrai's essence and transformed into an abomination.</p><p>Rhuobhe Manslayer has since used his powers to further his agenda of human destruction. Establishing himself in a strategically important pass between the Seamists and the Stonecrown mountain ranges, he has harried and bedeviled humans for nearly 1,500 years.</p><p>Through the years, the Manslayer's skin has become a dusky gray, like light ash or cold marble. The pupils and irises of his eyes have vanished, leaving cold white orbs. When angry, bis new eyes blaze with light and fury. Rhuobhe is one of the most powerful of the Anuirean awnsheghlien, second only to <a href=\"/appendix/thegorg\">the Gorgon</a>.</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Combat:</b> When Rhuobhe prepares himself for combat, his entire realm knows it. Perhaps there's tension in the air, or perhaps a faint rumbling in the earth signals his intent. When he dons <i>Glaivebreaker</i> (his suit of <i>elven plate +4</i>) and <i>Anger's Turning</i> (his <i>shield +3</i>), and raises <i>Heartspiller</i> (his <i>bastard sword +4, life stealing</i>) or <i>Winged Death</i> (a <i>long bow +3</i>), his domain waits with bated breath, eagerly anticipating the destruction of Rhuobhe's enemies.</p><p>Rhuobbe need not cany a quiver of arrows with him, for he can summon bolts of energy from the air. The incandescent blue bolts have no bonuses to attacks, though they are treated as +5 enchanted weapons for purpose of hitting creatures with immunities to normal weapons. When these arrows bit, the target must save vs. spell or suffer an additional 1d6 points of damage.</p><p>The blood of Azrai has somehow altered Rhuobhe so that be cannot be harmed by arrows, quarrels, or other propelled missiles. Though catapults, daggers, and axes can injure him, arrows bounce from his skin with no effect.</p><p>Nothing invisible escapes his milky eyes. They strip away subterfuge and illusions to reveal the heart of a matter, forcing Rhuobhe's enemies to combat him in the open. However, his sensitive eyes can not tolerate bright light; in highly illuminated areas, he attacks with a -4 penalty. He can no longer walk in the daylight world as be was wont to do before his transformation. He is a creature of the twilight now, and he curses those who have the ability to enjoy the day.</p><p>Rhuobhe is also a potent sorcerer. He can cast spells in combat while wearing his plate armor, though his bands must be free to do so. It is said that he regularly consorts with creatures from the nether planes, binding them to his bidding and learning arcane secrets from them. Though this is probably mere superstition-a tale to frighten small children- it tangibly adds to the very real aura of menace that bangs about the elf.</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Habitat/Society:</b> Rhuobhe now spends his time plotting the downfall of humanity from his fortress, Ruannoch, on the shores of a snow-fed lake at the base of the Seamist mountain range. He has gathered a force of many hundreds of elves to him, and is training them to destroy neighboring kingdoms.</p><p>His tower is a blackened spire, the base of which is a tremendous tree stump. The lower portion is surrounded by a wall of thorns, with only a small, well-guarded path to the portcullis. Cages hang from outcroppings on the spire, filled with the skeletons of elves treacherous to his cause, and humans who've foolishly attempted to destroy the Manslayer.</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Ecology:</b> Rhuobhe has undergone a remarkable metamorphosis. Throughout his long years of life, be has become more and more lawful, his life dedicated more to preserving and expanding the elven way of life at the cost of enjoying his own. Though Cerilian elves are traditionally chaotic, he has drifted into the realm of neutrality. Thus, some would say that be no longer represents the elven way, and is therefore unfit to drive the humans from Cerilia.</p>\n","images":["<img src=\"grf/br.gif\" width=\"150\" height=\"75\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Birthright\" title=\"Birthright\" align=\"right\">","<img src=\"img/rhuomans.gif\" alt=\"Rhuobhe Manslayer\" title=\"Rhuobhe Manslayer\" border=\"0\" style=\"text-align:right;\" align=\"right\">","<img src=\"grf/tsr_sm.png\" width=\"56\" height=\"59\" border=\"0\" alt=\"TSR\">"],"setting":"Birthright","statblock":{"Rhuobhe Manslayer":{"Activity Cycle":"Nocturnal","Alignment":"Neutral evil","Armor Class":"6 (base); -8 in armor","Blood":"True (Azrai): 95","Blood Abilities":"Awareness (minor), Bloodform (major), Enhanced sense (major), Fear (major), Regeneration (minor)","Climate/Terrain":"Rhuobhe/Forests","Damage/Attack":"2d4+7 (sword) or 1d8+3 (bow)","Diet":"Special","Frequency":"Unique","Hit Points":"88","Intelligence":"Genius (18)","Magic Resistance":"25%","Morale":"Fearless (20)","Movement":"15","No. Appearing":"1","No. of Attacks":"2/1","Organization":"Solitary","Realm Spells":"<i>Demagague, dispel realm magic, mass destruction, raze, scry, subversion, warding</i>","Size":"L (7')","Special Attacks":"Create arrows","Special Defenses":"+3 or better weapons to hit, invulnerable to arrows","THAC0":"5 (base); -2 with sword or bow","Treasure":"Domain Treasure","XP Value":"21,000"}},"title":"Rhuobhe Manslayer"},"sources":["3100"],"statblock_names":[],"title":"Rhuobhe Manslayer","prev_key":"rhoeghn","next_key":"ridiliza","monster_path":"/appendix/rhuomans"}},"staticQueryHashes":[],"slicesMap":{}}
