While the powers listed above are the most common, some aarakocra have different or additional powers.</p><p class=\"f\">A race of intelligent, birdlike creatures living in the deepest deserts of Athas, the rare Athasian <a href=\"/appendix/aarakocr\">aarakocra</a> spends its time soaring on thermals in search of food.</p><p>The aarakocra is 7 to 8 feet tall with a wingspan of 20 feet or more. Because of its large wingspan, an aarakocra can carry as much as 75% of its own body weight and still fly easily. An aarakocra can fly a short distance carrying a burden equaling 125% of its own body weight. The average body weight of a full grown male is 100 pounds and a female is 85 pounds.</p><p>Each wing has a &ldquo;hand&rdquo; at its midpoint, consisting of three fingers and an opposable thumb. The fourth finger forms the rigid leading edge of the wing. In flight the hands cannot be used, but on the ground the aarakocra can use its hands almost as a human would. The aarakocra's body is protected by a thin bony plate on the chest, much like a solid rib cage. Talons on its legs can be used as claws and can be retracted to reveal a second set of hands, also with three fingers and an opposable thumb. Except for the chest plate, the entire skeleton is hollow and extremely fragile.</p><p>From a distance, the Athasian aarakocra resembles a huge <a href=\"/appendix/bird\">vulture</a>. Its black eyes, set in the front of the head, provide excellent vision over a long range. The plumage is generally black with a white collar for adult males and black or brown with a smaller white collar for females. Adolescents are a mixture of brown and black. The beak is large and covers most of the head. Plumage begins at the crown of the head and is darker near the head, except for the collar. Athasian aarakocra speak their own language and the languages of vultures and other large birds. Some speak the common tongue (5% to 10% chance depending on how deep in the wastelands a tribe lives).</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Combat:</b> Aarakocra can fight in the air or on the ground. They prefer aerial combat since their bones are too fragile to withstand a solid blow from a human-sized opponent. In combat against creatures on the ground, they prefer to fly over their victim and drop weighted nets. Some aarakocra use darts to harass ground-based opponents.</p><p>If their opponents can fly, the aarakocra generally forgo the use of the net, although large groups sometimes use nets on flying creatures. Normally, aarakocra attack flying creatures with long spears, diving from above and allowing the momentum to carry the spear through the target. Such an attack doubles the damage if the aarakocra have been able to dive at least 50 feet. Only the very largest aarakocra can carry more than one of these spears, they can attack with both at once with no penalty, causing double damage on each strike. All diving attacks are made at +4 and should be treated as a charge attack. All other penalties and restrictions of charge attacks apply.</p><p>The effect of the aarakocra's nets depends on if the opponent is flying at the time it becomes entangled. Creatures on the ground that are hit by a net are entangled and unable to participate in any combat until they make a successful Strength check to get free of the net. Flying creatures hit by a net can no longer fly and immediately begin falling. If they cannot escape the net or use some magical means to arrest the fall, normal falling damage applies.</p><p>Unless victims are entangled in nets, aarakocra are cautious in ground combat. If the aarakocra outnumber their opponents they advance in a straight line and thrust with their spears. If outnumbered, or the opponents are particularly tough, the aarakocra withdraw. Victims entangled in nets are killed or incapacitated for use as food or ransom.</p><p>Athasian aarakocra are mindful of their physical limitations as well as their comparatively low psionic abilities. They do not normally initiate psionic combat. At the first sign of psionic powers from any of their victims, however, all aarakocra that have some ability will use whatever attack and defense modes they can in an attempt to destroy the threat. Large groups of is or more aarakocra may initiate psionic combat if their leaders feel they can win quickly and avoid physical combat.</p><p>In desperation, an aarakocra can attempt to bite an opponent in combat. Because of the unwieldiness of its beak, the aarakocra has a THAC0 of 18 if attacking with this appendage. Further, the birdman causes only 1d2 points of damage with the beak.</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Habitat/Society:</b> Athasian aarakocra live in tribes with 6-20 (2d8+4) members, depending on the prestige of the leader. The largest tribe ever recorded had 50 members. The tribal hunting territory depends on the size of the tribe, usually about 500 square miles for a tribe of 10 members. There are no rigid boundaries between tribes and border disputes are not uncommon.</p><p>Alignments of tribe members are similar to the alignment of the leader. A tribe that has a leader who is neutral good may have neutral good, chaotic good, lawful good, and true neutral members. A predominantly evil tribe does not recognize boundaries with other tribes and treats other tribes as inferior beings to be eliminated.</p><p>Athasian aarakocra aren't happy in enclosed spaces, but they they take refuge in a cave or building if necessary.</p><p>Nonevil tribes live in rocky aeries in the highest peaks they can find. Evil tribes are normally nomadic and use an aerie made by another tribe if they need to remain in an area for a long time, even if they have to evict the tribe that made the nest.</p><p>Aarakocra aren't friendly toward intruders in their territory, especially caravans. They try to extract a toll from the caravan for passage through the desert. Good-aligned tribes allow unhindered passage of caravans that pay a tribute. If someone refuses to pay the tribute, the aarakocra try to capture scouts or outriders from the party and hold them until an even larger tribute is paid. The payment may be either livestock or shiny objects. Aarakocra are smart enough not to be taken in by glass baubles instead of gems, although they cannot tell the difference between the more common gems and the rare ones.</p><p>Evil tribes ask for tribute and often attack a caravan whether it pays or not. Aarakocra always demand shiny objects such as stones. These tribes find humans and demihumans to be quite tasty and prefer them to other food.</p><p>Good-aligned tribes of aarakocra sometimes return a lost traveler to the edge of the desert after first removing any valuables the traveler may be carrying. On very rare occasions a tribe might return a lost group of travelers to the more frequently traveled parts of the desert, again after first taking any valuables as payment.</p><p>The oldest male is the leader of the tribal hunting party and has 4+4 Hit Dice. The oldest female is in charge of the tribal aerie and has 3+3 HD. In tribes that have more than 15 members, the next oldest aarakocra serves as shaman and has 3+3 HD; the shaman completes the triumvirate necessary for proper worship and the summoning of elementals. (Interestingly, no magic-using aarakocra has ever been recorded.) Tribes without a shaman cannot summon <a href=\"/appendix/element1\">air elementals</a>, which is an important part of aarakocra culture.</p><p>The shaman is the leader of the daily sun worship. Aarakocra worship the sun because it provides them with the thermals they need to soar in search of food. The shaman also leads the mystic rituals used to summon an air elemental. Summoning an air elemental is usually done only in preparation for the tribe's most sacred ceremony, the hunt. Small tribes must band together for this ceremony to allow the triumvirate to be formed.</p><p>The ceremony to summon an air elemental must be conducted at dawn and requires the oldest male and female to emit a highpitched keening whistle. The shaman conducts an intricate dance around them, simultaneously chanting an ancient summoning mantra.</p><p>The hunt is the final part of the initiation of adolescent aarakocra to adulthood and often takes the tribe far from their normal teritory. The target is always a <a href=\"/appendix/drakalsi\">silt drake</a>. The hunt is the only time the females leave the relative safety of the nest. Even an evil tribe will not interfere with a tribe on a hunt. An air elemental is often summoned to help find the drake, but never takes part in the actual combat. Although the adult members of the tribe take part in the initial phases of the combat, it is the initiates who deliver the final, killing blows to me drake. Scars from the hunt are considered a mark of pride among all aarakocra.</p><p>The females spend about eight months of the year incubating their eggs. Athasian aarakocra mate for life and a pair normally produces as many as 10 offspring. A female lays one egg a year. Constant incubation is not required because of the high daytime temperatures, so the females can maintain the nest and keep the tribe's treasure in order.</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Ecology:</b> Athasian aarakocra are high on the food chain and have no natural enemies other than <a href=\"/appendix/drakatha\">drakes</a>. Unless evil, aarakocra leave their own territory only to hunt the silt drake and return as soon as possible when the hunt is over. (Evil aarakocra attack others, as noted above.) Aarakocra eggs and hatchlings are sought after by wealthy land owners who wish to use the creatures as scouts and sentries. An egg can bring as much as 10 cp in Tyr's marketplace. Tribes that have had eggs or hatchlings stolen have long memories and sometimes take revenge against the thief at a later date. Captive aarakocra join any tribe they come in contact with.</p><p>Athasian aarakocra have a natural life span of 21-30 years.</p>\n","images":["<img src=\"grf/ds.gif\" width=\"150\" height=\"75\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Dark Sun\" title=\"Dark Sun\" align=\"right\">","<img src=\"img/aarakath.gif\" alt=\"Aarakocra (Athas)\" title=\"Aarakocra (Athas)\" border=\"0\" width=\"300\" height=\"360\" style=\"text-align:right;\" align=\"right\">","<img src=\"grf/add2_01.gif\" width=\"200\" height=\"56\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Advanced Dungeons & Dragons 2nd Edition\">"],"setting":"Dark Sun","statblock":{"Aarakocra (Athas)":{"Activity Cycle":"Day","Alignment":"Any","Armor Class":"7","Climate/Terrain":"Deep desert","Damage/Attack":"1d3/1d3 or by weapon","Diet":"Carnivore","Frequency":"Rare","Hit Dice":"2+2","Intelligence":"Average (8-10)","Magic Resistance":"Nil","Morale":"Steady (11)","Movement":"6, Fl 36 (C)","No. Appearing":"1d10","No. of Attacks":"2","Organization":"Tribal","Size":"M (20'+ wingspan)","Special Attacks":"Nil","Special Defenses":"Nil","THAC0":"17","Treasure":"Varies","XP Value":"65"}},"title":"Aarakocra (Athas)"},"sources":["2433"],"statblock_names":[],"title":"Aarakocra (Athas)","prev_key":"zygraat","next_key":"aarakocr","monster_path":"/appendix/aarakath"}}},"pageContext":{"monster_key":"shadecla","monster_data":{"TSR":["Dragon213"],"fullBody":"  <table cellspacing=\"0\" cellpadding=\"0\"><tr><th>Climate/Terrain:</th><td>Any (demiplane of Shadow or shadowy areas)</td></tr><tr><th>Frequency:</th><td>Very rare</td></tr><tr><th>Organization:</th><td>Solitary</td></tr><tr><th>Activity Cycle:</th><td>Special</td></tr><tr><th>Diet:</th><td>See below</td></tr><tr><th>Intelligence:</th><td>Varies</td></tr><tr><th>Treasure:</th><td>Varies</td></tr><tr><th>Alignment:</th><td>Any</td></tr><tr><th>No. Appearing:</th><td>1</td></tr><tr><th>Armor Class:</th><td>As original creature</td></tr><tr><th>Movement:</th><td>As original creature</td></tr><tr><th>Hit Dice:</th><td>As original creature</td></tr><tr><th>THAC0:</th><td>As original creature</td></tr><tr><th>No. of Attacks:</th><td>As original creature</td></tr><tr><th>Damage/Attack:</th><td>Varies</td></tr><tr><th>Special Attacks:</th><td>See below</td></tr><tr><th>Special Defenses:</th><td>See below</td></tr><tr><th>Magic Resistance:</th><td>3% per level of original creature</td></tr><tr><th>Size:</th><td>As original creature</td></tr><tr><th>Morale:</th><td>Varies</td></tr><tr><th>XP Value:</th><td>Variable</td></tr></table><p class=\"f\">It is agreed by most sages that a shade is a once-powerful human or demihuman who sought out immortality by infusing his mortal body with shadowstuff—the “semi-element” that comprises the demiplane of Shadow. The magical union with this dark essence has brought about the character's transformation into a shade.</p><p>Only a single-classed human or demihuman of at least 10th level may become a shade. A dual-classed or multiclassed character can never become a shade. A shade may continue to advance in its class (racial limits still apply) but cannot change to another class under any circumstances. Knowledge of the rare and highly reclusive shades is kept secret by the few residents of the Prime Material Plane worlds who know of their existence.</p><p>The infusion of gloomy shadowstuff often changes the alignment of a shade (generally toward neutral and/or evil). Because of this, only 10% of all shades encountered will be of good alignment, 50% will be neutral, and the remaining 40% encountered will be evil. Only a wish spell may prevent this change. Once it has successfully completed the transformation, a shade is considered to be a true native of the demiplane.</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Special abilities:</b> The transformation empowers all shades with special abilities. Some abilities are always available, while others may be employed only in areas of heavy shadows. The infusion of shadowstuff extends a shade's life indefinitely, for unless a shade is slain outright, it will never die. Shades no longer need to eat, but subsist solely on shadows. Additionally, shades gain magic resistance equal to 3% for each level possessed. Shades are immune to disease and life-level loss. All shades are able to regenerate lost limbs (except for the head) in 2d8 weeks. In areas of sufficient shadows, a shade will regenerate lost hit points. Moreover, a shade is empowered with special spell-like abilities. These spell-like abilities are common to all shades in addition to other abilities available to each particular class:</p><p><i>Shadow walk</i> as per the seventh-level wizard spell (see <i>Player's Handbook</i>, page 186); two uses per day.</p><p><i>Lorloveim's shadowy transformation</i> as per the sixth-level wizard spell (see <i>Tome of Magic</i>, page 38) 3 uses per day.</p><p>The shadow may open a <i>gate</i> (ninth-level wizard spell, <i>PHB</i>, page 195) to the demiplane of Shadow once per day (100% chance of success). The <i>gate</i> summons a specific creature that the shade personally knows (ally, pet, etc.). The creature may refuse to pass through the gate and is under no obligation to obey or fight for the shade.</p><p><b>Effects of light and darkness:</b> A shade's power can wane or wav dramatically depending upon the lighting of its current surroundings. A shade is most powerful when surrounded in shadow. In areas of bright light or extreme darkness where shadows are scarce, a shade is weakened significantly and loses much of its special abilities.</p><p><b>General outlook</b></p><p class=\"f\">Most shades care little for the day-to-day affairs of mortals whose days are few and whose lives are consumed in petty quests and mundane struggles (an existence shades are glad to be freed from). The virtual immortality that all shades possess allows them to pursue those interests that they followed when mortal (magical research, increasing personal power or wealth, overseeing an ages-long project, etc.). Whatever endeavors they undertake, shades rarely interact with each other. The incorporation of shadowstuff into their beings invariably brings about a gloomy, sullen change in personality toward solitary behavior. Even good-aligned shades are affected in this way.</p><h2>The priest-shade</h2><p class=\"f\">This class of shade is among the rarest of all shades. Since most deitiesdo not approve of their clerics becoming shades, priests almost never become shades on their own. those who do often worship deities whose sphere of influence lies with shadow and darkness. Priest-shades lose all access to the Sun sphere of spells. Any priest who successfully becomes a shade has its Wisdom ability score permanently raised by one (with a maximum of 19).</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Combat:</b> Priest-shades are limited to the weapons and armor normally usable by their class. In shadowy areas, priestshades may, once per day, use the special ability either of <i>shadowharm</i> or <i>shadowheal</i>. When employing <i>shadowharm</i>, the priest-shade uses the magic of a <i>harm</i> spell on another creature's shadow, damaging the target as if affected by the 6thlevel priest spell, <i>harm</i> (saving throw allowed). Conversely, <i>shadowheal</i> will affect the target creature as if cured by a heal spell. The priest-shade must physically touch the target's shadow to use this special ability.</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Habitat/Society:</b> Because so few priests become shades, the priest-shade is the rarest of all shades. Given the fact that only the most devoted and powerful clerics rise high enough in level to become shades, it is improbable that such highlevel priests would forsake their deities to become shades unless given permission to do so. Priest-shades residing on the demiplane of Shadow must worship higher powers dwelling either in the Inner Planes or in the demiplane of Shadow (if any such exist in your campaign) to receive spells above second level. Priest-shades primarily seek to exist in their shadowy temples and live out their immortal existence obeying their deity. When priest-shades travel to the Prime Material Plane, it is mainly to keep in contact with the mortal members of their sect.</p><h2>The psionicist-shade</h2><p class=\"ni\">After priest-shades, psionicist-shades are the rarest type of shade. This is primarily due to the secretive nature of psionicists and their small numbers. The transformation for a psionicist gives the psionicist a boost to her mental powers. A psionicistshade permanently gains 20 to 80 (1d4 x 20) additional PSPs. Additionally, a psionicist-shade gains the sciences of <i>animate shadow</i> and <i>shadowform</i> (even if the psionicist-shade does not have access to the disciplines that include these sciences). The use of these sciences does not have an initial cost or maintenance cost, and a psionicist-shade never rolls a 20 on its power score. A psionicist-shade may use each of these abilities twice per day.</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Combat:</b> With poor hand-to-hand combat skills, psionicist-shades rarely enter into physical combat. Since psionic effects are not hampered on the demiplane of Shadow, a psionicist-shade can use all its powers to overcome an opponent. If seriously threatened, a psionicist-shade will flee using its innate <i>shadow walk</i> ability.</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Habitat/Society:</b> Psionicist-shades are the most reclusive of shades. They spend most of their immortal existence alone strengthening their mental abilities through dedicated practice, creating a psionic artifact or two, and occasionally dealing with troublesome intruders. Psionicist-shades' dwellings are spartan and devoid of earthly riches or other “useless” treasures. Items found within a psionicist-shade's abode primarily serve a utilitarian purpose. Psionicist-shades rarely leave the demiplane unless on a mission of personal importance.</p><h2>The rogue-shade</h2><p class=\"ni\">Only thieves—not bards—are eligible to become rogue-shades. Upon becoming a shade, a rogue-shade's Dexterity score is immediately raised three points (with a maximum of 19). This change in Dexterity improves the shade's thieving skill base scores appropriately. On the demiplane of Shadow or in areas of similar illumination, a rogue-shade can move silently and hide in shadows with a 100% base chance of success. When employing these skills, a rogue-shade is completely undetectable by normal means (but magical detection will still function).</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Combat:</b> Rogue-shades fight as they did in their mortal lives, except that they more craftily wield the power of shadows to aid them in their endeavors. Seemingly being able to dissolve into the shadows at will and then surprisingly reappear soon after in another area is the rogue-shade's main combat tactic ( +4 on attack rolls, +4 bonus to armor class when in shadowy areas). Rogue-shades are cunning opponents, always looking for an opportunity to utilize the surrounding shadows to the best advantage.</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Habitat/Society:</b> Rogue-shades enjoy accumulating wealth, especially if they can acquire riches through their thieving ways. Rogue-shades travel more than any other shade class between the demiplane of Shadow and the Prime Material Plane. Rogue-shades have been known to run thieving guilds on several Prime Material worlds from their home base on the demiplane of Shadow. Rogue-shades work solely for themselves and have never been known to serve a master. They primarily seek to fill their dark and dusky mansions with treasures and magical items. These mansions are always well guarded against unwanted visitors.</p><h2>The warrior-shade</h2><p class=\"ni\">Warrior-shades were once formidable fighters, paladins, and rangers who now fight in a new shadow-enhanced body. The fear of old age and its infirmities that eventually turn all stalwart warriors into feeble things is what drives most warriorshades to become shades and thus be forever able and strong. Any subclass of the warrior class may become a warriorshade. All warrior-shades add one point to their Strength ability (with a maximum of 19; any score from 18 to 18/00 is raised one category).</p><p>Paladins and rangers who become shades suffer a great loss of abilities. Paladins who move toward this darker side lose all benefits associated with their subclass (spell-casting, <i>cure disease</i>, <i>protection from evil</i>, etc.). A paladin's war horse will always desert a master who becomes a shade. Rangers who become shades are no longer considered a part of nature and so lose most of their special ranger abilities. A ranger retains only those of his tracking abilities that work both on the ranger's home plane and on the demiplane of Shadow and the ability to hide in shadows. A paladin or ranger who undergoes the process to become a warrior-shade is now a warrior of the same level (experience points adjusted downward appropriately).</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Combat:</b> A warrior-shade is formidable in combat. In shadowy areas, a warriorshade gains a +2 bonus to armor class, +2 to attack and damage rolls (cumulative with any other benefits). A warrior-shade also may animate a <i>shadow double</i> of itself once per day when sufficient shadows are present. A <i>shadow double</i> is an exact physical duplicate of the warrior-shade with regard to armor class, THAC0, and hit points (<i>shadow doubles</i> have no weapons but may pick up an available one). The <i>shadow double</i> will fight or move as directed by the warrior-shade and will remain until dismissed by the warrior-shade or slain. A <i>shadow double</i> must be within the warrior-shade's field of vision to be controlled. A loss of control will dispel the <i>shadow double</i> for that day.</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Habitat/Society:</b> Warrior-shades are among the most numerous of shades. They gave up their mortal lives to become eternal warriors. At times, they are seen emerging suddenly from the shadows on a great battlefield to aid some cause or nation. Oddly enough, while warriorshades enjoy battle, their brooding and solitary ways keep them from sharing their adventures with others. Once a battle has been finished, a warrior-shade usually slips back into the shadows— avoiding curious adventurers and other questioning folk. In their keeps and castles, warrior-shades live as most royalty does—having a full staff of servants, welltended and stocked stables, a secured armory, and lots of treasure. A few are believed to rule lands and people in dark, shady castles on the Prime Material Plane.</p><h2>The wizard-shade</h2><p class=\"ni\">This is the most common type of shade encountered. Any subclass of wizard may become a wizard-shade. Of all the character classes, wizards are perhaps the ones most likely to use life-extension methods. For wizards, the shade-transformation is viewed as a much more pleasant option than undeath. Wizard-shades add one point to their Intelligence scores (with a maximum of 19).</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Combat:</b> Wizard-shades suffer none of the spell limitations that normal wizards do when casting spells on the demiplane of Shadow. Spells that deal with shadows when cast by a wizard-shade will have double strength and a double duration. Illusion/phantasm spells cast by a wizardshade are more difficult to disbelieve (-2 penalty to save) since the caster has a deeper comprehension of the shadowy magic being wielded.</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Habitat/Society:</b> The lure of long life, the love of magic, and the desire to pursue a deeper understanding of their magic are the primary reasons that wizards become shades. Their immortality allows for nearly limitless research and creation of spells, magical items, and an artifact or two. Wizard-shades prefer to stay locked up in their towers to continue their arcane research. A few wizard-shades have been known to live in towers of solid shadowstuff situated on the border of a Quasi- Elemental Planes and an Energy Plane. How these structures withstand such harsh environments remains a mystery. Wizard-shades are very private and have rarely been known to accept strangers into their dwellings. Some wizard-shades keep in touch with old comrades on the Prime Material Plane and have been reported to aid friends in times of need.</p><p class=\"f\">Character subclasses of unique worlds: DMs may opt to allow character subclasses unique to certain worlds the option of becoming shades. These special subclasses would fall under the appropriate class heading (an Athasian gladiator would become a warrior-shade, a templar would become a priest-shade, etc.)</p><table style=\"border-color: black; border: 1px;\"><tr><th>Light conditions*</th><th>Regenerate</th><th>Magic resistance</th><th>Damage from condition</th><th>Special abilities**</th></tr><tr><td>Bright</td><td>No</td><td>Standard, saves at -4 penalty</td><td>lose 1 hp/round</td><td>None</td></tr><tr><td>Average</td><td>No</td><td>Standard, saves at -2 penalty</td><td>lose 1 hp/turn</td><td>None</td></tr><tr><td>Twilight</td><td>1 hp/turn</td><td>3% per lvl</td><td>None</td><td>1, 2</td></tr><tr><td>Shadowy</td><td>1 hp/turn</td><td>3% per lvl</td><td>none</td><td>1, 2, 3</td></tr><tr><td>Night</td><td>1 hp/turn</td><td>3% per lvl</td><td>none</td><td>1, 2</td></tr><tr><td>Complete darkness</td><td>No</td><td>Standard, saves at -2 penalty</td><td>lose 1 hp/turn</td><td>None</td></tr></table><p>*—Light conditions:</p><table><tr><td>Type</td><td>Examples</td></tr><tr><td>Bright</td><td>Bright sunlight on clear day<br>Center of <i>continual light</i> spell<br>Light without shadows (from several sources around shade)</td></tr><tr><td>Average</td><td>Normal daylight with shade or clouds<br>Center of <i>light</i> spell<br>Outline of <i>faerie fire</i> or similar spell</td></tr><tr><td>Twilight</td><td>Dawn or dusk<br>Average indoor light<br>Edges of <i>light</i>/<i>continual light</i> spell</td></tr><tr><td>Shadowy</td><td>Normal illumination on demiplane of<br>Shadow<br>Underground torchlight<br>Dimly lit room or forested area</td></tr><tr><td>Night</td><td>Room with windows at night<br>Moonless or cloudy night sky</td></tr><tr><td>Complete darkness</td><td>Pitch black, overcast night sky<br>Unlit interior room or cavern<br>In area of <i>darkness</i> spell</td></tr></table><p>**Special abiltities:</p><p class=\"ni\">1= <i>shadow walk</i></p><p class=\"ni\">2= <i>Lorloveim's shadowy transformation</i></p><p class=\"ni\">3= <i>gate</i></p><h2>The transformation</h2><p class=\"ni\">A shade may be created in one of two ways. One is by the use of the new ninthlevel wizard spell create shade, which is described below. The other way is alluded to in the Player's Handbook under the ninth-level wizard spell <i>energy drain</i>, page 194—a wizard who has his Constitution score reduced to 0 by multiple castings of <i>energy drain</i> dies and is “reborn” as a wizard-shade. A shade created in this manner immediately undergoes an alignment change to neutral evil (due to an imbalance caused by tapping the Negative Energy Plane when casting <i>energy drain</i>).</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Create Shade</b></p><p class=\"ni\">Alteration</p><table cellspacing=\"0\" cellpadding=\"0\"><tr><td>Level: 9</td></tr><tr><td>Range: Special</td></tr><tr><td>Components: V, S, M</td></tr><tr><td>Duration: Perm.</td></tr><tr><td>Casting Time: 1 day</td></tr><tr><td>Area of Effect: 1 creature</td></tr><tr><td>Saving Throw: None</td></tr></table><p class=\"f\">This powerful spell infuses one being with shadowstuff from the demiplane of Shadow and transforms him into a shade. The subject of this spell must be a singleclassed human or demihuman (psionicist, priest, thief, warrior, or wizard only) of at least 10th level.</p><p>The casting of this spell is a long, delicate, and highly complex procedure. The caster and the recipient must not be disturbed at all, or else the spell will fail. The caster must additionally cast <i>shadow walk</i>, <i>Lorloveim's shadowy transformation</i>, <i>gate</i>, and <i>permanency</i> upon the subject for the transformation to succeed.</p><p>Upon completion of all the castings, the subject must successfully roll a system shock roll.</p><p>A 25% bonus may be added to this roll if this spell is cast on the demiplane of Shadow. A percentile roll less than or equal to the survival chance indicates that the subject has been transformed successfully into a shade. Failure means that the subject dissolves away into shadow—lost forever. Any attempt (even by a wish) to return the subject to normal will automatically fail.</p><p>It is possible for a character to have his alignment changed by this spell.
