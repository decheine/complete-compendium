While the powers listed above are the most common, some aarakocra have different or additional powers.</p><p class=\"f\">A race of intelligent, birdlike creatures living in the deepest deserts of Athas, the rare Athasian <a href=\"/appendix/aarakocr\">aarakocra</a> spends its time soaring on thermals in search of food.</p><p>The aarakocra is 7 to 8 feet tall with a wingspan of 20 feet or more. Because of its large wingspan, an aarakocra can carry as much as 75% of its own body weight and still fly easily. An aarakocra can fly a short distance carrying a burden equaling 125% of its own body weight. The average body weight of a full grown male is 100 pounds and a female is 85 pounds.</p><p>Each wing has a &ldquo;hand&rdquo; at its midpoint, consisting of three fingers and an opposable thumb. The fourth finger forms the rigid leading edge of the wing. In flight the hands cannot be used, but on the ground the aarakocra can use its hands almost as a human would. The aarakocra's body is protected by a thin bony plate on the chest, much like a solid rib cage. Talons on its legs can be used as claws and can be retracted to reveal a second set of hands, also with three fingers and an opposable thumb. Except for the chest plate, the entire skeleton is hollow and extremely fragile.</p><p>From a distance, the Athasian aarakocra resembles a huge <a href=\"/appendix/bird\">vulture</a>. Its black eyes, set in the front of the head, provide excellent vision over a long range. The plumage is generally black with a white collar for adult males and black or brown with a smaller white collar for females. Adolescents are a mixture of brown and black. The beak is large and covers most of the head. Plumage begins at the crown of the head and is darker near the head, except for the collar. Athasian aarakocra speak their own language and the languages of vultures and other large birds. Some speak the common tongue (5% to 10% chance depending on how deep in the wastelands a tribe lives).</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Combat:</b> Aarakocra can fight in the air or on the ground. They prefer aerial combat since their bones are too fragile to withstand a solid blow from a human-sized opponent. In combat against creatures on the ground, they prefer to fly over their victim and drop weighted nets. Some aarakocra use darts to harass ground-based opponents.</p><p>If their opponents can fly, the aarakocra generally forgo the use of the net, although large groups sometimes use nets on flying creatures. Normally, aarakocra attack flying creatures with long spears, diving from above and allowing the momentum to carry the spear through the target. Such an attack doubles the damage if the aarakocra have been able to dive at least 50 feet. Only the very largest aarakocra can carry more than one of these spears, they can attack with both at once with no penalty, causing double damage on each strike. All diving attacks are made at +4 and should be treated as a charge attack. All other penalties and restrictions of charge attacks apply.</p><p>The effect of the aarakocra's nets depends on if the opponent is flying at the time it becomes entangled. Creatures on the ground that are hit by a net are entangled and unable to participate in any combat until they make a successful Strength check to get free of the net. Flying creatures hit by a net can no longer fly and immediately begin falling. If they cannot escape the net or use some magical means to arrest the fall, normal falling damage applies.</p><p>Unless victims are entangled in nets, aarakocra are cautious in ground combat. If the aarakocra outnumber their opponents they advance in a straight line and thrust with their spears. If outnumbered, or the opponents are particularly tough, the aarakocra withdraw. Victims entangled in nets are killed or incapacitated for use as food or ransom.</p><p>Athasian aarakocra are mindful of their physical limitations as well as their comparatively low psionic abilities. They do not normally initiate psionic combat. At the first sign of psionic powers from any of their victims, however, all aarakocra that have some ability will use whatever attack and defense modes they can in an attempt to destroy the threat. Large groups of is or more aarakocra may initiate psionic combat if their leaders feel they can win quickly and avoid physical combat.</p><p>In desperation, an aarakocra can attempt to bite an opponent in combat. Because of the unwieldiness of its beak, the aarakocra has a THAC0 of 18 if attacking with this appendage. Further, the birdman causes only 1d2 points of damage with the beak.</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Habitat/Society:</b> Athasian aarakocra live in tribes with 6-20 (2d8+4) members, depending on the prestige of the leader. The largest tribe ever recorded had 50 members. The tribal hunting territory depends on the size of the tribe, usually about 500 square miles for a tribe of 10 members. There are no rigid boundaries between tribes and border disputes are not uncommon.</p><p>Alignments of tribe members are similar to the alignment of the leader. A tribe that has a leader who is neutral good may have neutral good, chaotic good, lawful good, and true neutral members. A predominantly evil tribe does not recognize boundaries with other tribes and treats other tribes as inferior beings to be eliminated.</p><p>Athasian aarakocra aren't happy in enclosed spaces, but they they take refuge in a cave or building if necessary.</p><p>Nonevil tribes live in rocky aeries in the highest peaks they can find. Evil tribes are normally nomadic and use an aerie made by another tribe if they need to remain in an area for a long time, even if they have to evict the tribe that made the nest.</p><p>Aarakocra aren't friendly toward intruders in their territory, especially caravans. They try to extract a toll from the caravan for passage through the desert. Good-aligned tribes allow unhindered passage of caravans that pay a tribute. If someone refuses to pay the tribute, the aarakocra try to capture scouts or outriders from the party and hold them until an even larger tribute is paid. The payment may be either livestock or shiny objects. Aarakocra are smart enough not to be taken in by glass baubles instead of gems, although they cannot tell the difference between the more common gems and the rare ones.</p><p>Evil tribes ask for tribute and often attack a caravan whether it pays or not. Aarakocra always demand shiny objects such as stones. These tribes find humans and demihumans to be quite tasty and prefer them to other food.</p><p>Good-aligned tribes of aarakocra sometimes return a lost traveler to the edge of the desert after first removing any valuables the traveler may be carrying. On very rare occasions a tribe might return a lost group of travelers to the more frequently traveled parts of the desert, again after first taking any valuables as payment.</p><p>The oldest male is the leader of the tribal hunting party and has 4+4 Hit Dice. The oldest female is in charge of the tribal aerie and has 3+3 HD. In tribes that have more than 15 members, the next oldest aarakocra serves as shaman and has 3+3 HD; the shaman completes the triumvirate necessary for proper worship and the summoning of elementals. (Interestingly, no magic-using aarakocra has ever been recorded.) Tribes without a shaman cannot summon <a href=\"/appendix/element1\">air elementals</a>, which is an important part of aarakocra culture.</p><p>The shaman is the leader of the daily sun worship. Aarakocra worship the sun because it provides them with the thermals they need to soar in search of food. The shaman also leads the mystic rituals used to summon an air elemental. Summoning an air elemental is usually done only in preparation for the tribe's most sacred ceremony, the hunt. Small tribes must band together for this ceremony to allow the triumvirate to be formed.</p><p>The ceremony to summon an air elemental must be conducted at dawn and requires the oldest male and female to emit a highpitched keening whistle. The shaman conducts an intricate dance around them, simultaneously chanting an ancient summoning mantra.</p><p>The hunt is the final part of the initiation of adolescent aarakocra to adulthood and often takes the tribe far from their normal teritory. The target is always a <a href=\"/appendix/drakalsi\">silt drake</a>. The hunt is the only time the females leave the relative safety of the nest. Even an evil tribe will not interfere with a tribe on a hunt. An air elemental is often summoned to help find the drake, but never takes part in the actual combat. Although the adult members of the tribe take part in the initial phases of the combat, it is the initiates who deliver the final, killing blows to me drake. Scars from the hunt are considered a mark of pride among all aarakocra.</p><p>The females spend about eight months of the year incubating their eggs. Athasian aarakocra mate for life and a pair normally produces as many as 10 offspring. A female lays one egg a year. Constant incubation is not required because of the high daytime temperatures, so the females can maintain the nest and keep the tribe's treasure in order.</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Ecology:</b> Athasian aarakocra are high on the food chain and have no natural enemies other than <a href=\"/appendix/drakatha\">drakes</a>. Unless evil, aarakocra leave their own territory only to hunt the silt drake and return as soon as possible when the hunt is over. (Evil aarakocra attack others, as noted above.) Aarakocra eggs and hatchlings are sought after by wealthy land owners who wish to use the creatures as scouts and sentries. An egg can bring as much as 10 cp in Tyr's marketplace. Tribes that have had eggs or hatchlings stolen have long memories and sometimes take revenge against the thief at a later date. Captive aarakocra join any tribe they come in contact with.</p><p>Athasian aarakocra have a natural life span of 21-30 years.</p><p></p><br clear=\"all\" style=\"clear:both; height:0;\">\r\n","images":["<img src=\"grf/ds.gif\" width=\"150\" height=\"75\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Dark Sun\" title=\"Dark Sun\" align=\"right\">","<img src=\"img/aarakath.gif\" alt=\"Aarakocra (Athas)\" title=\"Aarakocra (Athas)\" border=\"0\" width=\"300\" height=\"360\" style=\"text-align:right;\" align=\"right\">","<img src=\"grf/add2_01.gif\" width=\"200\" height=\"56\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Advanced Dungeons & Dragons 2nd Edition\">"],"setting":"Dark Sun","statblock":{"Aarakocra (Athas)":{"Activity Cycle":"Day","Alignment":"Any","Armor Class":"7","Climate/Terrain":"Deep desert","Damage/Attack":"1d3/1d3 or by weapon","Diet":"Carnivore","Frequency":"Rare","Hit Dice":"2+2","Intelligence":"Average (8-10)","Magic Resistance":"Nil","Morale":"Steady (11)","Movement":"6, Fl 36 (C)","No. Appearing":"1d10","No. of Attacks":"2","Organization":"Tribal","Size":"M (20'+ wingspan)","Special Attacks":"Nil","Special Defenses":"Nil","THAC0":"17","Treasure":"Varies","XP Value":"65"}},"title":"Aarakocra (Athas)"},"sources":["2433"],"statblock_names":[],"title":"Aarakocra (Athas)","prev_key":"zygraat","next_key":"aarakocr","monster_path":"/appendix/aarakath"}}},"pageContext":{"monster_key":"genizkdj","monster_data":{"TSR":["1077"],"fullBody":"  <table cellspacing=\"0\" cellpadding=\"0\"><tr><th>Climate/Terrain:</th><td>Air, desert</td></tr><tr><th>Frequency:</th><td>Very rare</td></tr><tr><th>Organization:</th><td>Caliphate</td></tr><tr><th>Activity Cycle:</th><td>Day</td></tr><tr><th>Diet:</th><td>Omnivore</td></tr><tr><th>Intelligence:</th><td>Average to highly (8-14)</td></tr><tr><th>Treasure:</th><td>F</td></tr><tr><th>Alignment:</th><td>Chaotic good</td></tr><tr><th>No. Appearing:</th><td>1</td></tr><tr><th>Armor Class:</th><td>4</td></tr><tr><th>Movement:</th><td>9, Fl 24 (A)</td></tr><tr><th>Hit Dice:</th><td>7+3</td></tr><tr><th>THAC0:</th><td>13</td></tr><tr><th>No. of Attacks:</th><td>1</td></tr><tr><th>Damage/Attack:</th><td>2-16(2d8)</td></tr><tr><th>Special Attacks:</th><td>Whirlwind; see below</td></tr><tr><th>Special Defenses:</th><td>Air-based combat; see below</td></tr><tr><th>Magic Resistance:</th><td>Nil</td></tr><tr><th>Size:</th><td>L (10½ wing span)</td></tr><tr><th>Morale:</th><td>Elite (13-14)</td></tr><tr><th>XP Value:</th><td>6,000</td></tr></table><p class=\"f\">Djinn are proud, sensuous genies from the Elemental Plane of Air (<i>Djinn</i> is plural; <i>djinni</i> is singular.) While an adventurer may encounter these creatures in great number on their home plane, djinn tend to be solitary when visiting the Land of Fate. They favor the uncluttered vistas of the open desert to densely populated regions. Djinn are somewhat friendly toward mortals, however, and as a result, they may visit Zakhara's cities.</p><p class=\"f\">Djinn look like exceedingly tall, well-muscled men and women. Their features are noble and attractive. Their skin color ranges from pale blue to the more common olive-brown and dark tan of desert natives. Their eyes are usually brown, but there are also blue-eyed djinn, who are believed to be marked by Fate for great actions. (Blue also suggests increased powers of the <i>evil eye</i>, however.) Djinn dress in airy, shimmering silks, which are designed for comfort as well as to flaunt their musculature. </p><p class=\"f\">Like most genies, djinn have a limited form of telepathy, which enables them to converse with any being of low intelligence or better. (This can make djinn valuable translators. Let negotiators beware, however: capricious djinn may relay their own \"interpretations.\") Djinn also speak Midani, as well as the language shared by all geniekind. The djinn dialect of the latter is sibilant and melodious, like a breeze passing through an orchard.</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Combat:</b> Djinn can use each of the following spell-like abilities once per day: They can <i>create nutritious food</i> for 2 to 12 (2d6) persons and <i>create water</i> or <i>wine</i> for 2 to 12 (2d6) persons. They can <i>create soft goods</i> (up to 16 cubic feet) or <i>wooden items</i> (up to 9 cubic feet) of a permanent nature. They also can <i>create metal</i> with a short lifespan. (The harder the metal, the shorter its duration. While djinni gold lasts 24 hours, djinni steel lasts but an hour.) Djinn can<p class=\"f\">create illusions</p> that have both visible and audible components, and that last without concentration until they are touched or dispelled. All of these illusions are cast with the ability of a 20th-level wizard. (A sha'ir who is able to identify the works of geniekind can use that ability to detect the source of a djinni's illusions.) A djinni can also become <i>invisible</i>, <i>assume gaseous form</i>, and <i>wind walk</i>.</p><p class=\"f\">Also once per day, a Zakharan djinni has the ability to harness the air and create a whirlwind, which the creature can ride or even direct at will from a distance (usually to attack, with a range of sight). The whirlwind is a cone-shaped spiral, measuring up to 10 feet across at its base, 40 feet at the top, and up to 70 feet in height. (The djinni chooses the whirlwind's dimensions.) Its maximum speed is 18, with maneuverability class A. The base of the whirlwind must touch earth, water, or some solid surface; else the whirlwind dissolves. It takes a full turn for the whirlwind to form or dissolve. During that turn, the funnel cloud inflicts no damage, nor does it have any other effect. The whirlwind lasts as long as the djinni concentrates upon it, moving at the creature's whim.</p><p class=\"f\"> If the whirlwind strikes a nonaerial creature of fewer than 2 Hit Dice, the creature may be swept off its feet, battered, and killed. To avoid these effects, the target must make a successful saving throw vs. breath weapon for each round of contact with the whirlwind. Hardier beings-as well as all aerial or airborne creature - suffer 2 to 12 (2d6) points of damage per round of contact with the whirlwind.</p><p class=\"f\"> As noted above, the djinni can ride its whirlwind. The djinni may even allow passengers on board, who (like the djinni) suffer no damage from the buffeting winds. Besides the djinni, the whirlwind can carry up to six man-sized or three genie-sized creatures without slowing.</p><p class=\"f\"> Because of their link to the Elemental Plane of Air, djinn enjoy an advantage in air-based combat. Creatures or attacks based on elemental air suffer a -1 penalty to attack and damage rolls when battling a djinni. In addition, a djinni gains a +4 bonus to saving throws against air-based attacks and elemental air spells, including poison gas attacks, gaseous breath weapons, and magics such as <i>cloudkill</i> and <i>control normal winds</i>.</p><p class=\"f\"> Brute force is a poor persuader of djinn. Rather than be captured (or injured), a djinni who is overmatched in combat usually takes to flight and uses its whirlwind to buffet followers.</p><p class=\"f\"> A djinni can carry up to 600 pounds without tiring, whether flying or traveling afoot. It can even carry 1,200 pounds for a short time: three turns if afoot, one turn if flying. For every 100 pounds less than 1,200, a djinni can walk or fly one additional turn before fatigue sets in. (For example, a djinni carrying 1,000 pounds can walk for up to five turns and fly for up to three.) Once fatigued, the creature must rest six turns before attempting further strenuous activity. These weight limitations do not apply to the djinni's whirlwind. However, any baggage or cargo that is not carried by the djinni - or by the djinni's passengers - is not protected; it can be damaged by the funnel cloud's high winds (items that fail a saving throw vs. crushing blow are destroyed).</p><img src=\"/img/spc/genizkdj1.gif\" width=\"300\" height=\"360\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Genie of Zakhara, Djinni\" title=\"Genie of Zakhara, Djinni\" style=\"float:left;\"/><p class=\"f\"> <i>Interplanar Travel</i>: Like most genies, djinn can travel freely to any elemental plane, as well as to the Prime Material Plane, Ethereal Plane, and Astral Plane. They usually restrict their travel to the Elemental Plane of Air and the Prime Material Plane. Djinn may also be summoned to the Prime Material Plane as a result of a character's magical ability or item.</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Habitat/Society:</b> The djinn's native land is the Elemental Plane of Air, where they settle floating islands of earth and rock. These landholds measure anywhere from 1,000 yards to several miles across. They are crammed with wondrous buildings, courtyards, fountains, and gardens, as well as topiary forms and sculptures made of elemental flames. While djinn can fly easily, most habitats of the non-noble djinn are built with nonflying creatures in mind. Sweeping staircases, ramps, slides, and ladders allow ambulatory servants and visitors to move around freely.</p><p class=\"f\">A typical landhold is home to 3 to 30 (3d10) djinn, 1 to 10 jann, and 1 to 10 air elemental creatures of low intelligence. A single <i>sheikh</i>- always a djinni of maximum hit points - presides over the landhold. The sheikh answers to a loose confederation of <i>caliphs</i>. These caliphs are also served by <i>viziers</i>, <i>beys</i>, and <i>emirs</i>. The ultimate ruler of all djinn is the <i>Great Caliph</i>, Commander of the Four Winds, Defender of the Heavens, Master of the Air. All high-ranking creatures (from viziers and sheikhs to the Great Caliph) are <a href=\"/appendix/geninodj\">noble djinn</a>.</p><p class=\"f\"> All djinn swear allegiance and fealty to the Great Caliph. His word is law. A djinni risks punishmentfor disobeying a local caliph, but death is the penalty for violating the Great Caliph's will.</p><p class=\"f\"> Djinn landholds practice mutual defense. If one is attacked, its residents send messengers to other outposts. Soon, the entire djinn nation is mobilized and prepared for war. In the Elemental Plane of Air, solid building ground is at a premium (for any resident). Mutual defense allows the djinn to protect what they own. Other sentient races on the plane shy away from attacking djinn landholds, since they know that the djinn will return the attack in kind.</p><p class=\"f\"> Although the caliphate organization is fairly loose, it still too restrictive for many free-living djinn. They often visit the Prime Material Plane for a respite from family and local lords. These vacationers favor the wild, open deserts, where they ride whirlwinds and visit jann (their genie cousins). Djinn found in the deep, forlorn desert usually want solitude, and they may view intruders unkindly.</p><p class=\"f\"> Most djinn are friendly toward mortals, however. Of all the genie races, only jann are more tolerant of these \"short-lived comical little creatures.\" While outright attacks on mortals are rare, djinn are mischievous. A favorite djinni trick is to create an illusionary person who implores a mortal to recover some item or to play some trick - always to djinni's advantage. This sort of mischief becomes especially heavy-handed against creatures who use wings or some artificial means to fly (such as a magic carpet). Djinn resent such creatures for challenging them in their own element.</p><p class=\"f\"> Despite their impish nature, djinn consider some targets off limits for pranks. A djinni will rarely vexhigh-ranking or important mortals, because they may have ties to the Great Caliph. A djinni is also cautious aboutplaying tricks on another djinni.</p><p class=\"f\"> Of the true genies, djinn are most amenable to servitude. A djinni may even forgive a mortal master's flaws and be amused by his or her petty actions. Limited servitude, believe the djinn, is a matter of Fate, and no being may contest the hand of Fate. Long-term service displeases the djinn, however. Imprisonment is anathema. And betrayal-particularly by a mortal whom they trusted - is a vile deed which only the most deadly vengeance can amend.</p><p class=\"f\"> If a character desires the brief service of a djinni, the creature may be entreated with gifts of fine meals, gems, and magical treasures, or otherwise flattered and bribed into compliance-provided, of course, the service does not require too much risk or expenditure on the creature's part. Sha'irs of sufficient power may forgo such niceties; they can summon, bind into service, or imprison a djinni by using their spell-like abilities.</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Ecology:</b> Djinn do not need to eat or drink. However, they do enjoy rich flavors, smells, andsensations. Succulent fruits, great feasts, pungent wines, fine perfumes, shimmering silks, smooth satins, softvelvets-these are common djinn desires. They are creatures of comfort and ease, working when forced to or when theysee a particular need. They prefer permanent, crafted materials to their own creations, and this brings them incontact with mortals.</p><p class=\"f\"> The djinn are on good terms with <a href=\"/appendix/genizkhjn\">jann</a> and sometimes visit their desertcamps. They are on cool terms with <a href=\"/appendix/genizkme\">marids</a>, who tend to be haughty. Djinn outwardlydespise <a href=\"/appendix/genizkda\">dao</a> and <a href=\"/appendix/genizkef\">efreet</a>, and rarely hesitate tostrike against them. A single djinni is weaker than a single dao or efreeti, however, so such an attack is either amassed ambush, or, more commonly, an assault in which a mortal is conned into aiding a djinni (thereby incurring thewrath of the dao or efreet).</p><br clear=\"all\" style=\"clear:both; height:0;\"><br>\n","images":["<img src=\"grf/xx.gif\" width=\"150\" height=\"75\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Advanced Dungeons & Dragons 2nd Edition\" title=\"Al-Qadim (Forgotten Realms)\" align=\"right\">","<img src=\"img/genizkdj.gif\" alt=\"Genie of Zakhara, Djinni\" title=\"Genie of Zakhara, Djinni\" border=\"0\" width=\"300\" height=\"360\" style=\"text-align:right;\" align=\"right\">","<img src=\"/img/spc/genizkdj1.gif\" width=\"300\" height=\"360\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Genie of Zakhara, Djinni\" title=\"Genie of Zakhara, Djinni\" style=\"float:left;\"/>"],"setting":"Al-Qadim (Forgotten Realms)","statblock":{"Genie of Zakhara, Djinni":{"Activity Cycle":"Day","Alignment":"Chaotic good","Armor Class":"4","Climate/Terrain":"Air, desert","Damage/Attack":"2-16(2d8)","Diet":"Omnivore","Frequency":"Very rare","Hit Dice":"7+3","Intelligence":"Average to highly (8-14)","Magic Resistance":"Nil","Morale":"Elite (13-14)","Movement":"9, Fl 24 (A)","No. Appearing":"1","No. of Attacks":"1","Organization":"Caliphate","Size":"L (10½ wing span)","Special Attacks":"Whirlwind; see below","Special Defenses":"Air-based combat; see below","THAC0":"13","Treasure":"F","XP Value":"6,000"}},"title":"Genie of Zakhara, Djinni"},"sources":["1077"],"statblock_names":[],"title":"Genie of Zakhara, Djinni","prev_key":"genizkda","next_key":"genizkef","monster_path":"/appendix/genizkdj"}},"staticQueryHashes":[],"slicesMap":{}}
