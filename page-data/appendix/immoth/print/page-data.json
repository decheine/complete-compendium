While the powers listed above are the most common, some aarakocra have different or additional powers.</p><p class=\"f\">A race of intelligent, birdlike creatures living in the deepest deserts of Athas, the rare Athasian <a href=\"/appendix/aarakocr\">aarakocra</a> spends its time soaring on thermals in search of food.</p><p>The aarakocra is 7 to 8 feet tall with a wingspan of 20 feet or more. Because of its large wingspan, an aarakocra can carry as much as 75% of its own body weight and still fly easily. An aarakocra can fly a short distance carrying a burden equaling 125% of its own body weight. The average body weight of a full grown male is 100 pounds and a female is 85 pounds.</p><p>Each wing has a &ldquo;hand&rdquo; at its midpoint, consisting of three fingers and an opposable thumb. The fourth finger forms the rigid leading edge of the wing. In flight the hands cannot be used, but on the ground the aarakocra can use its hands almost as a human would. The aarakocra's body is protected by a thin bony plate on the chest, much like a solid rib cage. Talons on its legs can be used as claws and can be retracted to reveal a second set of hands, also with three fingers and an opposable thumb. Except for the chest plate, the entire skeleton is hollow and extremely fragile.</p><p>From a distance, the Athasian aarakocra resembles a huge <a href=\"/appendix/bird\">vulture</a>. Its black eyes, set in the front of the head, provide excellent vision over a long range. The plumage is generally black with a white collar for adult males and black or brown with a smaller white collar for females. Adolescents are a mixture of brown and black. The beak is large and covers most of the head. Plumage begins at the crown of the head and is darker near the head, except for the collar. Athasian aarakocra speak their own language and the languages of vultures and other large birds. Some speak the common tongue (5% to 10% chance depending on how deep in the wastelands a tribe lives).</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Combat:</b> Aarakocra can fight in the air or on the ground. They prefer aerial combat since their bones are too fragile to withstand a solid blow from a human-sized opponent. In combat against creatures on the ground, they prefer to fly over their victim and drop weighted nets. Some aarakocra use darts to harass ground-based opponents.</p><p>If their opponents can fly, the aarakocra generally forgo the use of the net, although large groups sometimes use nets on flying creatures. Normally, aarakocra attack flying creatures with long spears, diving from above and allowing the momentum to carry the spear through the target. Such an attack doubles the damage if the aarakocra have been able to dive at least 50 feet. Only the very largest aarakocra can carry more than one of these spears, they can attack with both at once with no penalty, causing double damage on each strike. All diving attacks are made at +4 and should be treated as a charge attack. All other penalties and restrictions of charge attacks apply.</p><p>The effect of the aarakocra's nets depends on if the opponent is flying at the time it becomes entangled. Creatures on the ground that are hit by a net are entangled and unable to participate in any combat until they make a successful Strength check to get free of the net. Flying creatures hit by a net can no longer fly and immediately begin falling. If they cannot escape the net or use some magical means to arrest the fall, normal falling damage applies.</p><p>Unless victims are entangled in nets, aarakocra are cautious in ground combat. If the aarakocra outnumber their opponents they advance in a straight line and thrust with their spears. If outnumbered, or the opponents are particularly tough, the aarakocra withdraw. Victims entangled in nets are killed or incapacitated for use as food or ransom.</p><p>Athasian aarakocra are mindful of their physical limitations as well as their comparatively low psionic abilities. They do not normally initiate psionic combat. At the first sign of psionic powers from any of their victims, however, all aarakocra that have some ability will use whatever attack and defense modes they can in an attempt to destroy the threat. Large groups of is or more aarakocra may initiate psionic combat if their leaders feel they can win quickly and avoid physical combat.</p><p>In desperation, an aarakocra can attempt to bite an opponent in combat. Because of the unwieldiness of its beak, the aarakocra has a THAC0 of 18 if attacking with this appendage. Further, the birdman causes only 1d2 points of damage with the beak.</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Habitat/Society:</b> Athasian aarakocra live in tribes with 6-20 (2d8+4) members, depending on the prestige of the leader. The largest tribe ever recorded had 50 members. The tribal hunting territory depends on the size of the tribe, usually about 500 square miles for a tribe of 10 members. There are no rigid boundaries between tribes and border disputes are not uncommon.</p><p>Alignments of tribe members are similar to the alignment of the leader. A tribe that has a leader who is neutral good may have neutral good, chaotic good, lawful good, and true neutral members. A predominantly evil tribe does not recognize boundaries with other tribes and treats other tribes as inferior beings to be eliminated.</p><p>Athasian aarakocra aren't happy in enclosed spaces, but they they take refuge in a cave or building if necessary.</p><p>Nonevil tribes live in rocky aeries in the highest peaks they can find. Evil tribes are normally nomadic and use an aerie made by another tribe if they need to remain in an area for a long time, even if they have to evict the tribe that made the nest.</p><p>Aarakocra aren't friendly toward intruders in their territory, especially caravans. They try to extract a toll from the caravan for passage through the desert. Good-aligned tribes allow unhindered passage of caravans that pay a tribute. If someone refuses to pay the tribute, the aarakocra try to capture scouts or outriders from the party and hold them until an even larger tribute is paid. The payment may be either livestock or shiny objects. Aarakocra are smart enough not to be taken in by glass baubles instead of gems, although they cannot tell the difference between the more common gems and the rare ones.</p><p>Evil tribes ask for tribute and often attack a caravan whether it pays or not. Aarakocra always demand shiny objects such as stones. These tribes find humans and demihumans to be quite tasty and prefer them to other food.</p><p>Good-aligned tribes of aarakocra sometimes return a lost traveler to the edge of the desert after first removing any valuables the traveler may be carrying. On very rare occasions a tribe might return a lost group of travelers to the more frequently traveled parts of the desert, again after first taking any valuables as payment.</p><p>The oldest male is the leader of the tribal hunting party and has 4+4 Hit Dice. The oldest female is in charge of the tribal aerie and has 3+3 HD. In tribes that have more than 15 members, the next oldest aarakocra serves as shaman and has 3+3 HD; the shaman completes the triumvirate necessary for proper worship and the summoning of elementals. (Interestingly, no magic-using aarakocra has ever been recorded.) Tribes without a shaman cannot summon <a href=\"/appendix/element1\">air elementals</a>, which is an important part of aarakocra culture.</p><p>The shaman is the leader of the daily sun worship. Aarakocra worship the sun because it provides them with the thermals they need to soar in search of food. The shaman also leads the mystic rituals used to summon an air elemental. Summoning an air elemental is usually done only in preparation for the tribe's most sacred ceremony, the hunt. Small tribes must band together for this ceremony to allow the triumvirate to be formed.</p><p>The ceremony to summon an air elemental must be conducted at dawn and requires the oldest male and female to emit a highpitched keening whistle. The shaman conducts an intricate dance around them, simultaneously chanting an ancient summoning mantra.</p><p>The hunt is the final part of the initiation of adolescent aarakocra to adulthood and often takes the tribe far from their normal teritory. The target is always a <a href=\"/appendix/drakalsi\">silt drake</a>. The hunt is the only time the females leave the relative safety of the nest. Even an evil tribe will not interfere with a tribe on a hunt. An air elemental is often summoned to help find the drake, but never takes part in the actual combat. Although the adult members of the tribe take part in the initial phases of the combat, it is the initiates who deliver the final, killing blows to me drake. Scars from the hunt are considered a mark of pride among all aarakocra.</p><p>The females spend about eight months of the year incubating their eggs. Athasian aarakocra mate for life and a pair normally produces as many as 10 offspring. A female lays one egg a year. Constant incubation is not required because of the high daytime temperatures, so the females can maintain the nest and keep the tribe's treasure in order.</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Ecology:</b> Athasian aarakocra are high on the food chain and have no natural enemies other than <a href=\"/appendix/drakatha\">drakes</a>. Unless evil, aarakocra leave their own territory only to hunt the silt drake and return as soon as possible when the hunt is over. (Evil aarakocra attack others, as noted above.) Aarakocra eggs and hatchlings are sought after by wealthy land owners who wish to use the creatures as scouts and sentries. An egg can bring as much as 10 cp in Tyr's marketplace. Tribes that have had eggs or hatchlings stolen have long memories and sometimes take revenge against the thief at a later date. Captive aarakocra join any tribe they come in contact with.</p><p>Athasian aarakocra have a natural life span of 21-30 years.</p><br clear=\"all\" style=\"clear:both; height:0;\">\r\n","images":["<img src=\"grf/ds.gif\" width=\"150\" height=\"75\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Dark Sun\" title=\"Dark Sun\" align=\"right\">","<img src=\"img/aarakath.gif\" alt=\"Aarakocra (Athas)\" title=\"Aarakocra (Athas)\" border=\"0\" width=\"300\" height=\"360\" style=\"text-align:right;\" align=\"right\">","<img src=\"grf/add2_01.gif\" width=\"200\" height=\"56\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Advanced Dungeons & Dragons 2nd Edition\">"],"setting":"Dark Sun","statblock":{"Aarakocra (Athas)":{"Activity Cycle":"Day","Alignment":"Any","Armor Class":"7","Climate/Terrain":"Deep desert","Damage/Attack":"1d3/1d3 or by weapon","Diet":"Carnivore","Frequency":"Rare","Hit Dice":"2+2","Intelligence":"Average (8-10)","Magic Resistance":"Nil","Morale":"Steady (11)","Movement":"6, Fl 36 (C)","No. Appearing":"1d10","No. of Attacks":"2","Organization":"Tribal","Size":"M (20'+ wingspan)","Special Attacks":"Nil","Special Defenses":"Nil","THAC0":"17","Treasure":"Varies","XP Value":"65"}},"title":"Aarakocra (Athas)"},"sources":["2433"],"statblock_names":[],"title":"Aarakocra (Athas)","prev_key":"zygraat","next_key":"aarakocr","monster_path":"/appendix/aarakath"}}},"pageContext":{"monster_key":"immoth","monster_data":{"TSR":["2635"],"fullBody":"  <table cellspacing=\"0\" cellpadding=\"0\"><tr><th>Climate/Terrain:</th><td>Paraplane of Ice</td></tr><tr><th>Frequency:</th><td>Rare</td></tr><tr><th>Organization:</th><td>Solitary</td></tr><tr><th>Activity Cycle:</th><td>Any</td></tr><tr><th>Diet:</th><td>Carnivore</td></tr><tr><th>Intelligence:</th><td>High to exceptional (14-16)</td></tr><tr><th>Treasure:</th><td>Special</td></tr><tr><th>Alignment:</th><td>Neutral</td></tr><tr><th>No. Appearing:</th><td>1</td></tr><tr><th>Armor Class:</th><td>2</td></tr><tr><th>Movement:</th><td>12</td></tr><tr><th>Hit Dice:</th><td>10+3</td></tr><tr><th>THAC0:</th><td>9</td></tr><tr><th>No. of Attacks:</th><td>3</td></tr><tr><th>Damage/Attack:</th><td>1d8+1/1d8+1/2d4+2</td></tr><tr><th>Special Attacks:</th><td>Poison, words of power</td></tr><tr><th>Special Defenses:</th><td>Immune to cold, bladed weapons inflict half damage</td></tr><tr><th>Magic Resistance:</th><td>25%</td></tr><tr><th>Size:</th><td>L (8' tall)</td></tr><tr><th>Morale:</th><td>Fanatic (17-18)</td></tr><tr><th>XP Value:</th><td>8,000</td></tr></table><p class=\"f\">Words are power. It's been said many times, and each time it's the truth. It's also been said that on the Paraelemental Plane of Ice, the air is so cold that a cutter's words freeze the minute they're spoken. That's never been taken as a literal fact, but it's just as true a statement.</p><p>The frost-rimed immoth, giant native of the plane of Ice, knows the dark of where the frozen words go. It gathers them and taps the power inherent within. No one else has been able to fathom these secrets, but those who've encountered an immoth have no doubt that the chant about these creatures is true.</p><p>A giant made of icy crystals and encrusted with gemlike nuggets of ice, the immoth is both beautiful and terrible to behold. The creature is essentially humanoid but for the long tail that sweeps along the icy ground and the cruel talons that gleam at the end of its hands. Its sparkling, semitransparent body shimmers in the dim light of the plane of its origin. A beard of frost grows long on the face of the giant, marking its age. Mortals know no other means of distinguishing one immoth from another except by the length of the creatures' beards.</p><p>Each of the thousands of ice nuggets adhered along the immoth's body holds a frozen word gathered from a hidden place deep within the plane of Ice, a locale so utterly cold that everything freezes - even a body's speech. All words spoken on the Paraelemental Plane of Ice end up in this forbidden place to freeze for all eternity.</p><p>Immoths speak their own language and some speak planar common as well.</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Combat:</b> Physically imposing, an immoth can inflict grievous wounds with its icy talons (inflicting 1d8+1 points of damage each). Worse, however, the giant can also strike an opponent with its whiplike tail (causing 2d4+2 points of damage). Although the tail appears blunt, it's coated with a virulent contact poison secreted by the immoth. This strange venom, which appears as a partially frozen brown syrup, imparts a multistage affliction upon those who're struck and fail their saving throw.</p><p>The first stage of the poison's effects begins almost immediately. The victim collapses and suffers a -2 penalty to all actions. The poor sod then begins to suffer 1d3 points of damage every hour. Not long after - 1d100 rounds after the first stage begins - the second stage sets in, as the victim begins to lose his words. The poor sod finds himself helplessly babbling away, speaking whatever words come to his mind. Strangely, once he uses a particular word, he cannot ever use it again - it is purged from his memory. Even as he loses his words, the diction continues to rattle his bone-box until every bit of language he knows is gone. In 24 hours, if the sod is still alive, the poison finally finishes him off.</p><p>Further, the immoth can use the frozen words encrusted all over its body. Tapping into some inherent power, it can cause any of the ice crystals to shatter, releasing the word and a spell-like effect. An immoth casts spells as a 12th-level wizard, both in the power of its magic and in the number of spells it has available from the crystals. The immoth isn't restricted by the usual limitations on magic imposed by the nature of the plane of Ice: it essentially has an innate spell key to avoid any such conditions. Regardless, an immoth never conjures forth magic that generates heat or fire or summons other creatures. Instead, it prepares spell-like abilities that inflict pain or misfortune (such as <i>fumble</i>, <i>hold person</i>, or <i>magic missile</i>), that give it useful abilities (<i>fly</i>, <i>haste</i>, <i>passwall</i>, or <i>teleport</i>), or those with an icy nature (<i>cone of cold</i>, <i>ice storm</i>, or <i>wall of ice</i>). It can also manipulate spell effects to better control its frozen environment (<i>ice shape</i> rather than <i>stone shape</i>, <i>transmute ice to slush</i> rather than <i>transmute stone to mud</i>, and so on) as the DM allows.</p><p>Immoths are immune to cold attacks. Due to their hard crystalline nature, they suffer only half damage from bladed weapons. However, magical weapons are not required to strike them.</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Habitat/Society:</b> Immoths are solitary creatures that keep to themselves. No one knows how many of these creatures live on the plane of Ice, but the number seems to be small. Although reports claim the existence of a particular immoth that has a number of <a href=\"/appendix/frossala\">frost salamanders</a> <i>charmed</i> and under its control, it seems that most of the time the icy giants disdain the presence of other creatures.</p><p>When the immoths gather, they do so in a hidden locale somewhere in the Paraelemental Plane of Ice. This mysterious place lies somewhere near the fabled Mountain of Ultimate Winter. Here, chant has it, ideas, concepts, emotions, and words freeze forever in the incredible cold. Immoths scour the mountain for useful words trapped in the frozen ice. This area of the plane is said to be even colder than the rest, freezing non-natives solid in 1d4 rounds if they fail a saving throw versus spell (required each round).</p><p>When they need to feed, the creatures leave the mountain and prowl other areas of the plane for months at a time. During these hunting trips, immoths attack any living creature (whether native to the plane of Ice or not) that they encounter, considering all other beings potential sustenance. Attempts to parlay or otherwise communicate peacefully with the giants hit the blinds.</p><p>If there's a way for a body other than an immoth to utilize the power in the frozen word-crystals, no one's ever tumbled to it. That doesn't mean, however, that ambitious berks out there aren't giving it a try. A frozen word can be worth up to 100 gold pieces to the right buyer. 'Course, a body's got to figure out a canny way to get the icy crystal off the plane of Ice without it melting - no mean feat.</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Ecology:</b> Creatures of solid ice, the immoths are probably related to ice <a href=\"/appendix/paraelem\">paraelementals</a> in some way. One story relates that immoths are actually a group of intelligent ice elementals cursed by a powerful mortal witch. Supposedly, this woman came to the plane of Ice to obtain a number of servants; when the elementals refused to obey her commands, she magically compelled them to forever seek the words that she spoke to them on the Mountain of Ultimate Winter. This task changed them physically into the forms they currently wear. Once they find all of her words, the curse will be lifted - and in the meantime, the other words that they find can be useful.</p><p>Immoths eat any sort of living creature, feeding more on the life essence than the actual flesh, although they consume the flesh as well.</p><p>Most graybeards (at least, those who've bothered to study the reclusive creatures) believe that immoths do not reproduce.</p><br clear=\"all\" style=\"clear:both; height:0;\">\r\n","images":["<img src=\"grf/ps.gif\" width=\"150\" height=\"75\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Planescape\" title=\"Planescape\" align=\"right\">","<img src=\"img/immoth.gif\" alt=\"Immoth\" title=\"Immoth\" border=\"0\" width=\"300\" height=\"360\" style=\"text-align:right;\" align=\"right\">","<img src=\"grf/add2_01.gif\" width=\"200\" height=\"56\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Advanced Dungeons & Dragons 2nd Edition\">"],"setting":"Planescape","statblock":{"Immoth":{"Activity Cycle":"Any","Alignment":"Neutral","Armor Class":"2","Climate/Terrain":"Paraplane of Ice","Damage/Attack":"1d8+1/1d8+1/2d4+2","Diet":"Carnivore","Frequency":"Rare","Hit Dice":"10+3","Intelligence":"High to exceptional (14-16)","Magic Resistance":"25%","Morale":"Fanatic (17-18)","Movement":"12","No. Appearing":"1","No. of Attacks":"3","Organization":"Solitary","Size":"L (8' tall)","Special Attacks":"Poison, words of power","Special Defenses":"Immune to cold, bladed weapons inflict half damage","THAC0":"9","Treasure":"Special","XP Value":"8,000"}},"title":"Immoth"},"sources":["2635"],"statblock_names":[],"title":"Immoth","prev_key":"illithoc","next_key":"imp","monster_path":"/appendix/immoth"}},"staticQueryHashes":[],"slicesMap":{}}
