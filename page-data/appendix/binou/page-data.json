While the powers listed above are the most common, some aarakocra have different or additional powers.</p><p class=\"f\">A race of intelligent, birdlike creatures living in the deepest deserts of Athas, the rare Athasian <a href=\"/appendix/aarakocr\">aarakocra</a> spends its time soaring on thermals in search of food.</p><p>The aarakocra is 7 to 8 feet tall with a wingspan of 20 feet or more. Because of its large wingspan, an aarakocra can carry as much as 75% of its own body weight and still fly easily. An aarakocra can fly a short distance carrying a burden equaling 125% of its own body weight. The average body weight of a full grown male is 100 pounds and a female is 85 pounds.</p><p>Each wing has a &ldquo;hand&rdquo; at its midpoint, consisting of three fingers and an opposable thumb. The fourth finger forms the rigid leading edge of the wing. In flight the hands cannot be used, but on the ground the aarakocra can use its hands almost as a human would. The aarakocra's body is protected by a thin bony plate on the chest, much like a solid rib cage. Talons on its legs can be used as claws and can be retracted to reveal a second set of hands, also with three fingers and an opposable thumb. Except for the chest plate, the entire skeleton is hollow and extremely fragile.</p><p>From a distance, the Athasian aarakocra resembles a huge <a href=\"/appendix/bird\">vulture</a>. Its black eyes, set in the front of the head, provide excellent vision over a long range. The plumage is generally black with a white collar for adult males and black or brown with a smaller white collar for females. Adolescents are a mixture of brown and black. The beak is large and covers most of the head. Plumage begins at the crown of the head and is darker near the head, except for the collar. Athasian aarakocra speak their own language and the languages of vultures and other large birds. Some speak the common tongue (5% to 10% chance depending on how deep in the wastelands a tribe lives).</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Combat:</b> Aarakocra can fight in the air or on the ground. They prefer aerial combat since their bones are too fragile to withstand a solid blow from a human-sized opponent. In combat against creatures on the ground, they prefer to fly over their victim and drop weighted nets. Some aarakocra use darts to harass ground-based opponents.</p><p>If their opponents can fly, the aarakocra generally forgo the use of the net, although large groups sometimes use nets on flying creatures. Normally, aarakocra attack flying creatures with long spears, diving from above and allowing the momentum to carry the spear through the target. Such an attack doubles the damage if the aarakocra have been able to dive at least 50 feet. Only the very largest aarakocra can carry more than one of these spears, they can attack with both at once with no penalty, causing double damage on each strike. All diving attacks are made at +4 and should be treated as a charge attack. All other penalties and restrictions of charge attacks apply.</p><p>The effect of the aarakocra's nets depends on if the opponent is flying at the time it becomes entangled. Creatures on the ground that are hit by a net are entangled and unable to participate in any combat until they make a successful Strength check to get free of the net. Flying creatures hit by a net can no longer fly and immediately begin falling. If they cannot escape the net or use some magical means to arrest the fall, normal falling damage applies.</p><p>Unless victims are entangled in nets, aarakocra are cautious in ground combat. If the aarakocra outnumber their opponents they advance in a straight line and thrust with their spears. If outnumbered, or the opponents are particularly tough, the aarakocra withdraw. Victims entangled in nets are killed or incapacitated for use as food or ransom.</p><p>Athasian aarakocra are mindful of their physical limitations as well as their comparatively low psionic abilities. They do not normally initiate psionic combat. At the first sign of psionic powers from any of their victims, however, all aarakocra that have some ability will use whatever attack and defense modes they can in an attempt to destroy the threat. Large groups of is or more aarakocra may initiate psionic combat if their leaders feel they can win quickly and avoid physical combat.</p><p>In desperation, an aarakocra can attempt to bite an opponent in combat. Because of the unwieldiness of its beak, the aarakocra has a THAC0 of 18 if attacking with this appendage. Further, the birdman causes only 1d2 points of damage with the beak.</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Habitat/Society:</b> Athasian aarakocra live in tribes with 6-20 (2d8+4) members, depending on the prestige of the leader. The largest tribe ever recorded had 50 members. The tribal hunting territory depends on the size of the tribe, usually about 500 square miles for a tribe of 10 members. There are no rigid boundaries between tribes and border disputes are not uncommon.</p><p>Alignments of tribe members are similar to the alignment of the leader. A tribe that has a leader who is neutral good may have neutral good, chaotic good, lawful good, and true neutral members. A predominantly evil tribe does not recognize boundaries with other tribes and treats other tribes as inferior beings to be eliminated.</p><p>Athasian aarakocra aren't happy in enclosed spaces, but they they take refuge in a cave or building if necessary.</p><p>Nonevil tribes live in rocky aeries in the highest peaks they can find. Evil tribes are normally nomadic and use an aerie made by another tribe if they need to remain in an area for a long time, even if they have to evict the tribe that made the nest.</p><p>Aarakocra aren't friendly toward intruders in their territory, especially caravans. They try to extract a toll from the caravan for passage through the desert. Good-aligned tribes allow unhindered passage of caravans that pay a tribute. If someone refuses to pay the tribute, the aarakocra try to capture scouts or outriders from the party and hold them until an even larger tribute is paid. The payment may be either livestock or shiny objects. Aarakocra are smart enough not to be taken in by glass baubles instead of gems, although they cannot tell the difference between the more common gems and the rare ones.</p><p>Evil tribes ask for tribute and often attack a caravan whether it pays or not. Aarakocra always demand shiny objects such as stones. These tribes find humans and demihumans to be quite tasty and prefer them to other food.</p><p>Good-aligned tribes of aarakocra sometimes return a lost traveler to the edge of the desert after first removing any valuables the traveler may be carrying. On very rare occasions a tribe might return a lost group of travelers to the more frequently traveled parts of the desert, again after first taking any valuables as payment.</p><p>The oldest male is the leader of the tribal hunting party and has 4+4 Hit Dice. The oldest female is in charge of the tribal aerie and has 3+3 HD. In tribes that have more than 15 members, the next oldest aarakocra serves as shaman and has 3+3 HD; the shaman completes the triumvirate necessary for proper worship and the summoning of elementals. (Interestingly, no magic-using aarakocra has ever been recorded.) Tribes without a shaman cannot summon <a href=\"/appendix/element1\">air elementals</a>, which is an important part of aarakocra culture.</p><p>The shaman is the leader of the daily sun worship. Aarakocra worship the sun because it provides them with the thermals they need to soar in search of food. The shaman also leads the mystic rituals used to summon an air elemental. Summoning an air elemental is usually done only in preparation for the tribe's most sacred ceremony, the hunt. Small tribes must band together for this ceremony to allow the triumvirate to be formed.</p><p>The ceremony to summon an air elemental must be conducted at dawn and requires the oldest male and female to emit a highpitched keening whistle. The shaman conducts an intricate dance around them, simultaneously chanting an ancient summoning mantra.</p><p>The hunt is the final part of the initiation of adolescent aarakocra to adulthood and often takes the tribe far from their normal teritory. The target is always a <a href=\"/appendix/drakalsi\">silt drake</a>. The hunt is the only time the females leave the relative safety of the nest. Even an evil tribe will not interfere with a tribe on a hunt. An air elemental is often summoned to help find the drake, but never takes part in the actual combat. Although the adult members of the tribe take part in the initial phases of the combat, it is the initiates who deliver the final, killing blows to me drake. Scars from the hunt are considered a mark of pride among all aarakocra.</p><p>The females spend about eight months of the year incubating their eggs. Athasian aarakocra mate for life and a pair normally produces as many as 10 offspring. A female lays one egg a year. Constant incubation is not required because of the high daytime temperatures, so the females can maintain the nest and keep the tribe's treasure in order.</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Ecology:</b> Athasian aarakocra are high on the food chain and have no natural enemies other than <a href=\"/appendix/drakatha\">drakes</a>. Unless evil, aarakocra leave their own territory only to hunt the silt drake and return as soon as possible when the hunt is over. (Evil aarakocra attack others, as noted above.) Aarakocra eggs and hatchlings are sought after by wealthy land owners who wish to use the creatures as scouts and sentries. An egg can bring as much as 10 cp in Tyr's marketplace. Tribes that have had eggs or hatchlings stolen have long memories and sometimes take revenge against the thief at a later date. Captive aarakocra join any tribe they come in contact with.</p><p>Athasian aarakocra have a natural life span of 21-30 years.</p>\n","images":["<img src=\"grf/ds.gif\" width=\"150\" height=\"75\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Dark Sun\" title=\"Dark Sun\" align=\"right\">","<img src=\"img/aarakath.gif\" alt=\"Aarakocra (Athas)\" title=\"Aarakocra (Athas)\" border=\"0\" width=\"300\" height=\"360\" style=\"text-align:right;\" align=\"right\">","<img src=\"grf/add2_01.gif\" width=\"200\" height=\"56\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Advanced Dungeons & Dragons 2nd Edition\">"],"setting":"Dark Sun","statblock":{"Aarakocra (Athas)":{"Activity Cycle":"Day","Alignment":"Any","Armor Class":"7","Climate/Terrain":"Deep desert","Damage/Attack":"1d3/1d3 or by weapon","Diet":"Carnivore","Frequency":"Rare","Hit Dice":"2+2","Intelligence":"Average (8-10)","Magic Resistance":"Nil","Morale":"Steady (11)","Movement":"6, Fl 36 (C)","No. Appearing":"1d10","No. of Attacks":"2","Organization":"Tribal","Size":"M (20'+ wingspan)","Special Attacks":"Nil","Special Defenses":"Nil","THAC0":"17","Treasure":"Varies","XP Value":"65"}},"title":"Aarakocra (Athas)"},"sources":["2433"],"statblock_names":[],"title":"Aarakocra (Athas)","prev_key":"zygraat","next_key":"aarakocr","monster_path":"/appendix/aarakath"}}},"pageContext":{"monster_key":"binou","monster_data":{"TSR":["2158","1104"],"fullBody":"  <table cellspacing=\"0\" cellpadding=\"0\"><tr class=\"bk\"><th> </th><th class=\"cn\">Bi-Nou</th><th class=\"cn\">Rockworm</th><th class=\"cn\">Rocklord</th></tr><tr><th>Climate/Terrain:</th><td>Subterranean</td><td>Subterranean</td><td>Subterranean</td></tr><tr><th>Frequency:</th><td>Rare</td><td>Very rare</td><td>Very rare</td></tr><tr><th>Organization:</th><td>Solitary or clan</td><td>Solitary</td><td>Solitary</td></tr><tr><th>Activity Cycle:</th><td>Any</td><td>Any</td><td>Any</td></tr><tr><th>Diet:</th><td>Carnivore</td><td>Carnivore</td><td>Carnivore</td></tr><tr><th>Intelligence:</th><td>Very (11-12)</td><td>Low (5-7)</td><td>Semi- (2-4)</td></tr><tr><th>Treasure:</th><td>Special (eggs)</td><td>Special (eggs)</td><td>Special (hide)</td></tr><tr><th>Alignment:</th><td>Chaotic evil</td><td>Chaotic evil</td><td>Neutral</td></tr><tr><th>No. Appearing:</th><td>1 or 2-8</td><td>1 or 2</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><th>Armor Class:</th><td>1</td><td>-2</td><td>-4</td></tr><tr><th>Movement:</th><td>6</td><td>9</td><td>6</td></tr><tr><th>Hit Dice:</th><td>5+5</td><td>7</td><td>10</td></tr><tr><th>THAC0:</th><td>15</td><td>13</td><td>11</td></tr><tr><th>No. of Attacks:</th><td>2</td><td>2</td><td>2</td></tr><tr><th>Damage/Attack:</th><td>1d8/1d8</td><td>1d12/1d12</td><td>3d6/3d6</td></tr><tr><th>Special Attacks:</th><td>Spells, squeeze</td><td>Nil</td><td>Nil</td></tr><tr><th>Special Defenses:</th><td>Immune to blinding, mind-<br>affecting spells, and psionics</td><td>Nil</td><td>Nil</td></tr><tr><th>Magic Resistance:</th><td>20%</td><td>20%</td><td>30%</td></tr><tr><th>Size:</th><td>M (5-7' tall)</td><td>M (5-7' long)</td><td>L (8-15' long)</td></tr><tr><th>Morale:</th><td>Elite (13-14)</td><td>Champion (15)</td><td>Champion (15)</td></tr><tr><th>XP Value:</th><td>975</td><td>2,000</td><td>5,000</td></tr></table><p class=\"f\">Appearing as craggy columns with two short, jagged arms ending in spiky claws, bi-nou look like stalagmites. Their shapes render them practically invisible in a cavern filled with natural rocky outcroppings, stalactites, and stalagmites.</p><p>Common bi-nou range from five to seven feet tall and weigh from 600 to 1,000 pounds. Their rocky skin varies in color from off-white to dark gray, and they prefer to live in underground chambers where the natural rock color mimicks their own.</p><p>The bi-nou communicate telepathically in their own language and in <a href=\"/appendix/elfdrow\">drow</a>, as they possess neither mouths nor vocal cords.</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Combat:</b> Bi-nou are 70% likely to remain unnoticed when encountered. They do not see or hear by conventional means, and are effectively deaf and blind. However, they sense heat and vibrations, having a form of batlike sonar. Their unique senses give them a clear mental image of the size and shape of opponents within 80 feet, and they can distinguish between living and non-living matter. They ignore any penalties related to blinding effects (e.g., <i>invisibility</i>, <i>darkness</i>, <i>light</i>, etc.)</p><p>Bi-nou do not work together to attack their foes. They act independently, killing all living creatures entering their caverns. Despite their chaotic natures, some bi-nou have learned to hold their attacks until creatures move within 40 feet; this gives the monsters time to observe their foes.</p><p>Bi-nou often attack first with their innate spell abilities. Each of the following spells is usable once a day as if cast by a 10th-level wizard: <i>slow</i>, <i>dig</i>, <i>stone shape</i>, and <i>wall of stone</i>.</p><p>When foes are within striking range of a bi-nou, it strikes with two jagged limbs. If both limbs strike the same creature, the bi-nou snares the opponent and squeezes it against its rocky body. The creature suffers an additional 1d8 points of damage per round until it frees itself with a successful bend bars/lift gates roll, the bi-nou is killed, or it suffocates.</p><p>Although bi-nou have natural magic resistance, certain spells can be deadly to them. <i>Passwall</i> stuns them for 1d4 rounds instead of having its normal effect, and <i>rock to mud</i> slays them instantly. <i>Stone shape</i> operates as a heal spell, restoring all but 1d4 of a bi-nou's hit points.</p><p>A bi-nou's mind is different enough from other creatures' to make it immune to mind-affecting spells and psionic attacks.</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Habitat/Society:</b> Bi-nou hate all warm-blooded life - especially humans and humanoids, who hunt and steal their gem-like eggs. Bi-nou do not hesitate to attack groups of humanoids, even if the odds are against them. Only sick bi-nou or the very young fail to attack trespassers in their domain. Sages believe that when multiple bi-nou are present, they make contests of the killings, though all slain creatures are consumed as food. If the creatures were tampering with bi-nou eggs, there seems to be even a bit of malicious enjoyment in the kill.</p><p>Bi-nou are found either individually or in small family groups. Individuals tend to be rogue young or outcast adults. Groups are ruled by the largest bi-nou, and the leader's clan follows orders without question (save those pertaining to combat). The leader selects the cavern lair, determines which of his charges warm the eggs, and metes out punishment if eggs are harmed or stolen. Any bi-nou clan will have 2-8 eggs, each valued at 100-1,000 gp. The eggs are hard and faceted like gems, and are prized by dwarves, who have come to recognize their value and rarity.</p><p>Bi-nou prefer damp, drafty caverns, where it is easier to sense their prey. Such a cavern is likely to hold remnants of weapons and armor, as the bi-nou consume humans and other beings and animals by absorbing the fleshy parts. The rock creatures don't value these discarded <q>unlife things</q>, though they have learned that other living being - especially humans and demihumans - are attracted to the objects. Bi-nou have been known to use their stone shape ability to put the metallic leftovers on rocky pedestals to attract the attention of passing adventurers.</p><p>Bi-nou also have been known to ally with drow - when the number of dark elves is sufficient to pose a serious threat to their clan. The bi-nou act as sentries for drow communities and outposts, attacking and devouring trespassers, including drow who do not belong to the community they guard. A few bi-nou even act as guards for the dark elves, moving through their underground caverns and battling creatures that threaten the drow.</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Ecology:</b> Bi-nou are carnivorous, savoring the taste of animal, human, and demihuman flesh. They devour their victims by moving their forms over the bodies and absorbing all flesh. A bi-nou's treasure consists of unfortunate adventurers' gear and the rock creatures' eggs. Most equipment is worthless, damaged when the rock creatures absorb their prey. However, magical equipment tends to stay in reasonable shape. Bi-nou corpses are used by certain dwarves builders, especially duergar, as solid stone building materials.</p><p>Bi-nou are hunted by <a href=\"/appendix/dwarf\">dwarves</a>, particularly <a href=\"/appendix/dwarduer\">duergar</a>, who have discovered the rock creatures' eggs are valuable and that armor and weapons can be found in some lairs. The eggs are prevented from hatching by keeping them cold for many hours, killing the young inside. This ensures the eggs retain their gemlike appearance and value. Bi-nou eggs vary in size and color, the younger eggs being smaller but of brighter hue, while the older eggs are larger but lose much of their sheen.</p><p>No one knows exactly what the bi-nou are or how they came to be. Most sages believe bi-nou are living rocks created by some dark experiments of the drow. Some swear the rock creatures were spawned by the mage Halaster to act as guardians; they say that drow, while malign, are not known to create living things out of such crude matter.</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Rockworm</b></p>  <p class=\"ni\">Closely related to bi-nou, rockworms appear as stone snakes with arms. They move along the ground like reptiles. Rockworms are not capable of upright stance. They travel like ungainly snakes along cavern floors, using their jagged arms to help propel themselves. Sages speculate that rockworms are the predecessors of standard bi-nou, magically-created beings with which their maker or makers were not satisfied. (This is not true, however. Rockworms and bi-nou were created simultaneously from different experiments.)</p><p>Rockworms are malicious, seeming to hate all creatures that walk rather than crawl. Their attacking small groups of standard bi-nou to vie for cavern territory or to claim food killed by their upright kin is not unheard of. Like bi-nou, the rockworms particularly hunt out humans and demihumans as thieves of their eggs.</p><p>Unlike the bi-nou, rockworms do not attempt to hide in their surroundings - they lumber to the attack as soon as they see a potential meal. Rockworms do not fear alerting their prey to their presence. The segmented creatures know their thick skin is impervious to most attacks and believe they can eventually overtake most quarries.</p><p>Like standard bi-nou, rockworms lay valuable eggs. However, unlike their kin, they warm their own eggs, leaving them only for short times to catch nearby food. In this respect they act as parents, while bi-nou in a clan are assigned to egg-warming duty and never know which young are their own. Dwarves are more careful when hunting rockworms. Although the stone snakes are less intelligent, they can be more deadly.</p><p></p><p class=\"f\"><b>Rocklord</b></p>  <p class=\"ni\">More massive than rockworms, the <q>lords of stone</q>, as many call them, are deadly foes because of the massive amount of damage their stony appendages can deliver. Appearing as a stalagmite with larger limbs than a common bi-nou, these creatures can move upright or slither across the floor. Their thick hides make them very difficult to injure.</p><p>Some sages believe rocklords are simply very old rockworms. They do not lay eggs and they do not associate with others of their kind. However, unlike rockworms, the lords do not battle over possession of a cavern.</p><p>The hides of these great, craggy creatures are especially prized by underground races who mount war bands to destroy the beasts. The war bands are careful how they attack the lords, as they do not want to overly damage the hide. These are used to construct special buildings meant to keep others out. These rock lord hides are stronger and can withstand more weight and damage than those of rockworms or common bi-nou.</p><p>It is rumored that certain proficient dwarven weaponsmiths can create special maces from the skins of rocklords. The smiths claim these weapons are naturally +1 to hit and +3 to damage because of the density of the weapon and the magical properties of the rocklord. However, it takes three times as long to craft one of these weapons as a normal weapon.</p>\n","images":["<img src=\"grf/xx.gif\" width=\"150\" height=\"75\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Advanced Dungeons & Dragons 2nd Edition\" title=\"Advanced Dungeons & Dragons 2nd Edition\" align=\"right\">","<img src=\"img/binou.gif\" alt=\"Bi-nou\" title=\"Bi-nou\" border=\"0\" width=\"300\" height=\"360\" style=\"text-align:right;\" align=\"right\">","<img src=\"grf/tsr_sm.png\" width=\"56\" height=\"59\" border=\"0\" alt=\"TSR\">"],"setting":"Advanced Dungeons & Dragons 2nd Edition","statblock":{"Bi-Nou":{"Activity Cycle":"Any","Alignment":"Chaotic evil","Armor Class":"1","Climate/Terrain":"Subterranean","Damage/Attack":"1d8/1d8","Diet":"Carnivore","Frequency":"Rare","Hit Dice":"5+5","Intelligence":"Very (11-12)","Magic Resistance":"20%","Morale":"Elite (13-14)","Movement":"6","No. Appearing":"1 or 2-8","No. of Attacks":"2","Organization":"Solitary or clan","Size":"M (5-7' tall)","Special Attacks":"Spells, squeeze","Special Defenses":"Immune to blinding, mind-<br>affecting spells, and psionics","THAC0":"15","Treasure":"Special (eggs)","XP Value":"975"},"Rocklord":{"Activity Cycle":"Any","Alignment":"Neutral","Armor Class":"-4","Climate/Terrain":"Subterranean","Damage/Attack":"3d6/3d6","Diet":"Carnivore","Frequency":"Very rare","Hit Dice":"10","Intelligence":"Semi- (2-4)","Magic Resistance":"30%","Morale":"Champion (15)","Movement":"6","No. Appearing":"1","No. of Attacks":"2","Organization":"Solitary","Size":"L (8-15' long)","Special Attacks":"Nil","Special Defenses":"Nil","THAC0":"11","Treasure":"Special (hide)","XP Value":"5,000"},"Rockworm":{"Activity Cycle":"Any","Alignment":"Chaotic evil","Armor Class":"-2","Climate/Terrain":"Subterranean","Damage/Attack":"1d12/1d12","Diet":"Carnivore","Frequency":"Very rare","Hit Dice":"7","Intelligence":"Low (5-7)","Magic Resistance":"20%","Morale":"Champion (15)","Movement":"9","No. Appearing":"1 or 2","No. of Attacks":"2","Organization":"Solitary","Size":"M (5-7' long)","Special Attacks":"Nil","Special Defenses":"Nil","THAC0":"13","Treasure":"Special (eggs)","XP Value":"2,000"}},"title":"Bi-nou"},"sources":["2158","1104"],"statblock_names":[],"title":"Bi-nou","prev_key":"biclops","next_key":"bionoid","monster_path":"/appendix/binou"}},"staticQueryHashes":[],"slicesMap":{}}
