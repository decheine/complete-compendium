While the powers listed above are the most common, some aarakocra have different or additional powers.</p><p class=\"f\">A race of intelligent, birdlike creatures living in the deepest deserts of Athas, the rare Athasian <a href=\"/appendix/aarakocr\">aarakocra</a> spends its time soaring on thermals in search of food.</p><p>The aarakocra is 7 to 8 feet tall with a wingspan of 20 feet or more. Because of its large wingspan, an aarakocra can carry as much as 75% of its own body weight and still fly easily. An aarakocra can fly a short distance carrying a burden equaling 125% of its own body weight. The average body weight of a full grown male is 100 pounds and a female is 85 pounds.</p><p>Each wing has a &ldquo;hand&rdquo; at its midpoint, consisting of three fingers and an opposable thumb. The fourth finger forms the rigid leading edge of the wing. In flight the hands cannot be used, but on the ground the aarakocra can use its hands almost as a human would. The aarakocra's body is protected by a thin bony plate on the chest, much like a solid rib cage. Talons on its legs can be used as claws and can be retracted to reveal a second set of hands, also with three fingers and an opposable thumb. Except for the chest plate, the entire skeleton is hollow and extremely fragile.</p><p>From a distance, the Athasian aarakocra resembles a huge <a href=\"/appendix/bird\">vulture</a>. Its black eyes, set in the front of the head, provide excellent vision over a long range. The plumage is generally black with a white collar for adult males and black or brown with a smaller white collar for females. Adolescents are a mixture of brown and black. The beak is large and covers most of the head. Plumage begins at the crown of the head and is darker near the head, except for the collar. Athasian aarakocra speak their own language and the languages of vultures and other large birds. Some speak the common tongue (5% to 10% chance depending on how deep in the wastelands a tribe lives).</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Combat:</b> Aarakocra can fight in the air or on the ground. They prefer aerial combat since their bones are too fragile to withstand a solid blow from a human-sized opponent. In combat against creatures on the ground, they prefer to fly over their victim and drop weighted nets. Some aarakocra use darts to harass ground-based opponents.</p><p>If their opponents can fly, the aarakocra generally forgo the use of the net, although large groups sometimes use nets on flying creatures. Normally, aarakocra attack flying creatures with long spears, diving from above and allowing the momentum to carry the spear through the target. Such an attack doubles the damage if the aarakocra have been able to dive at least 50 feet. Only the very largest aarakocra can carry more than one of these spears, they can attack with both at once with no penalty, causing double damage on each strike. All diving attacks are made at +4 and should be treated as a charge attack. All other penalties and restrictions of charge attacks apply.</p><p>The effect of the aarakocra's nets depends on if the opponent is flying at the time it becomes entangled. Creatures on the ground that are hit by a net are entangled and unable to participate in any combat until they make a successful Strength check to get free of the net. Flying creatures hit by a net can no longer fly and immediately begin falling. If they cannot escape the net or use some magical means to arrest the fall, normal falling damage applies.</p><p>Unless victims are entangled in nets, aarakocra are cautious in ground combat. If the aarakocra outnumber their opponents they advance in a straight line and thrust with their spears. If outnumbered, or the opponents are particularly tough, the aarakocra withdraw. Victims entangled in nets are killed or incapacitated for use as food or ransom.</p><p>Athasian aarakocra are mindful of their physical limitations as well as their comparatively low psionic abilities. They do not normally initiate psionic combat. At the first sign of psionic powers from any of their victims, however, all aarakocra that have some ability will use whatever attack and defense modes they can in an attempt to destroy the threat. Large groups of is or more aarakocra may initiate psionic combat if their leaders feel they can win quickly and avoid physical combat.</p><p>In desperation, an aarakocra can attempt to bite an opponent in combat. Because of the unwieldiness of its beak, the aarakocra has a THAC0 of 18 if attacking with this appendage. Further, the birdman causes only 1d2 points of damage with the beak.</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Habitat/Society:</b> Athasian aarakocra live in tribes with 6-20 (2d8+4) members, depending on the prestige of the leader. The largest tribe ever recorded had 50 members. The tribal hunting territory depends on the size of the tribe, usually about 500 square miles for a tribe of 10 members. There are no rigid boundaries between tribes and border disputes are not uncommon.</p><p>Alignments of tribe members are similar to the alignment of the leader. A tribe that has a leader who is neutral good may have neutral good, chaotic good, lawful good, and true neutral members. A predominantly evil tribe does not recognize boundaries with other tribes and treats other tribes as inferior beings to be eliminated.</p><p>Athasian aarakocra aren't happy in enclosed spaces, but they they take refuge in a cave or building if necessary.</p><p>Nonevil tribes live in rocky aeries in the highest peaks they can find. Evil tribes are normally nomadic and use an aerie made by another tribe if they need to remain in an area for a long time, even if they have to evict the tribe that made the nest.</p><p>Aarakocra aren't friendly toward intruders in their territory, especially caravans. They try to extract a toll from the caravan for passage through the desert. Good-aligned tribes allow unhindered passage of caravans that pay a tribute. If someone refuses to pay the tribute, the aarakocra try to capture scouts or outriders from the party and hold them until an even larger tribute is paid. The payment may be either livestock or shiny objects. Aarakocra are smart enough not to be taken in by glass baubles instead of gems, although they cannot tell the difference between the more common gems and the rare ones.</p><p>Evil tribes ask for tribute and often attack a caravan whether it pays or not. Aarakocra always demand shiny objects such as stones. These tribes find humans and demihumans to be quite tasty and prefer them to other food.</p><p>Good-aligned tribes of aarakocra sometimes return a lost traveler to the edge of the desert after first removing any valuables the traveler may be carrying. On very rare occasions a tribe might return a lost group of travelers to the more frequently traveled parts of the desert, again after first taking any valuables as payment.</p><p>The oldest male is the leader of the tribal hunting party and has 4+4 Hit Dice. The oldest female is in charge of the tribal aerie and has 3+3 HD. In tribes that have more than 15 members, the next oldest aarakocra serves as shaman and has 3+3 HD; the shaman completes the triumvirate necessary for proper worship and the summoning of elementals. (Interestingly, no magic-using aarakocra has ever been recorded.) Tribes without a shaman cannot summon <a href=\"/appendix/element1\">air elementals</a>, which is an important part of aarakocra culture.</p><p>The shaman is the leader of the daily sun worship. Aarakocra worship the sun because it provides them with the thermals they need to soar in search of food. The shaman also leads the mystic rituals used to summon an air elemental. Summoning an air elemental is usually done only in preparation for the tribe's most sacred ceremony, the hunt. Small tribes must band together for this ceremony to allow the triumvirate to be formed.</p><p>The ceremony to summon an air elemental must be conducted at dawn and requires the oldest male and female to emit a highpitched keening whistle. The shaman conducts an intricate dance around them, simultaneously chanting an ancient summoning mantra.</p><p>The hunt is the final part of the initiation of adolescent aarakocra to adulthood and often takes the tribe far from their normal teritory. The target is always a <a href=\"/appendix/drakalsi\">silt drake</a>. The hunt is the only time the females leave the relative safety of the nest. Even an evil tribe will not interfere with a tribe on a hunt. An air elemental is often summoned to help find the drake, but never takes part in the actual combat. Although the adult members of the tribe take part in the initial phases of the combat, it is the initiates who deliver the final, killing blows to me drake. Scars from the hunt are considered a mark of pride among all aarakocra.</p><p>The females spend about eight months of the year incubating their eggs. Athasian aarakocra mate for life and a pair normally produces as many as 10 offspring. A female lays one egg a year. Constant incubation is not required because of the high daytime temperatures, so the females can maintain the nest and keep the tribe's treasure in order.</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Ecology:</b> Athasian aarakocra are high on the food chain and have no natural enemies other than <a href=\"/appendix/drakatha\">drakes</a>. Unless evil, aarakocra leave their own territory only to hunt the silt drake and return as soon as possible when the hunt is over. (Evil aarakocra attack others, as noted above.) Aarakocra eggs and hatchlings are sought after by wealthy land owners who wish to use the creatures as scouts and sentries. An egg can bring as much as 10 cp in Tyr's marketplace. Tribes that have had eggs or hatchlings stolen have long memories and sometimes take revenge against the thief at a later date. Captive aarakocra join any tribe they come in contact with.</p><p>Athasian aarakocra have a natural life span of 21-30 years.</p><br clear=\"all\" style=\"clear:both; height:0;\">\r\n","images":["<img src=\"grf/ds.gif\" width=\"150\" height=\"75\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Dark Sun\" title=\"Dark Sun\" align=\"right\">","<img src=\"img/aarakath.gif\" alt=\"Aarakocra (Athas)\" title=\"Aarakocra (Athas)\" border=\"0\" width=\"300\" height=\"360\" style=\"text-align:right;\" align=\"right\">","<img src=\"grf/add2_01.gif\" width=\"200\" height=\"56\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Advanced Dungeons & Dragons 2nd Edition\">"],"setting":"Dark Sun","statblock":{"Aarakocra (Athas)":{"Activity Cycle":"Day","Alignment":"Any","Armor Class":"7","Climate/Terrain":"Deep desert","Damage/Attack":"1d3/1d3 or by weapon","Diet":"Carnivore","Frequency":"Rare","Hit Dice":"2+2","Intelligence":"Average (8-10)","Magic Resistance":"Nil","Morale":"Steady (11)","Movement":"6, Fl 36 (C)","No. Appearing":"1d10","No. of Attacks":"2","Organization":"Tribal","Size":"M (20'+ wingspan)","Special Attacks":"Nil","Special Defenses":"Nil","THAC0":"17","Treasure":"Varies","XP Value":"65"}},"title":"Aarakocra (Athas)"},"sources":["2433"],"statblock_names":[],"title":"Aarakocra (Athas)","prev_key":"zygraat","next_key":"aarakocr","monster_path":"/appendix/aarakath"}}},"pageContext":{"monster_key":"ogre","monster_data":{"TSR":["2102","2140"],"fullBody":"  <table cellspacing=\"0\" cellpadding=\"0\"><tr class=\"bk\"><th> </th><th class=\"cn\">Ogre</th><th class=\"cn\">Ogre Mage</th><th class=\"cn\">Merrow</th></tr><tr><th>Climate/Terrain:</th><td>Any land</td><td>Any oriental land</td><td>Any water</td></tr><tr><th>Frequency:</th><td>Common</td><td>Very rare</td><td>Uncommon</td></tr><tr><th>Organization:</th><td>Tribal</td><td>Tribal</td><td>Tribal</td></tr><tr><th>Activity Cycle:</th><td>Any</td><td>Any</td><td>Any</td></tr><tr><th>Diet:</th><td>Carnivore</td><td>Carnivore</td><td>Carnivore</td></tr><tr><th>Intelligence:</th><td>Low (8)</td><td>Average to exceptional (9-16)</td><td>Average (8-10)</td></tr><tr><th>Treasure:</th><td>M (Q,B,S)</td><td>G (R,S, magic)</td><td>M (A)</td></tr><tr><th>Alignment:</th><td>Chaotic evil</td><td>Lawful evil</td><td>Chaotic evil</td></tr><tr><th>No. Appearing:</th><td>2-20 (2d10)</td><td>1-6</td><td>2-24 (2d12)</td></tr><tr><th>Armor Class:</th><td>5</td><td>4</td><td>4</td></tr><tr><th>Movement:</th><td>9</td><td>9, Fl 15 (B)</td><td>6, Sw 12</td></tr><tr><th>Hit Dice:</th><td>4+1</td><td>5+2</td><td>4+4</td></tr><tr><th>THAC0:</th><td>17</td><td>15</td><td>15</td></tr><tr><th>No. of Attacks:</th><td>1</td><td>1</td><td>3 or 1</td></tr><tr><th>Damage/Attack:</th><td>1-10 (or by weapon +6)</td><td>1-12</td><td>1-6/1-6/2-8 (or by weapon +6)</td></tr><tr><th>Special Attacks:</th><td>+2 to damage</td><td>Magic spells</td><td>See below</td></tr><tr><th>Special Defenses:</th><td>Nil</td><td>Nil</td><td>Camouflage</td></tr><tr><th>Magic Resistance:</th><td>Nil</td><td>Nil</td><td>Nil</td></tr><tr><th>Size:</th><td>Large (9'+)</td><td>Large (10&#189;')</td><td>Large (9')</td></tr><tr><th>Morale:</th><td>Steady (11-12)</td><td>Elite (13-14)</td><td>Steady (11-12)</td></tr><tr><th>XP Value:</th><td>270<br>Leader: 650<br>Chieftain: 975</td><td>650<br>Chieftain: 975</td><td>420<br>Leader: 650<br>Chieftain: 975</td></tr></table><p class=\"f\">Ogres are big, ugly, greedy humanoids that live by ambushes, raids, and theft. Ill-tempered and nasty, these monsters are often found serving as mercenaries in the ranks of <a href=\"/appendix/orc\">orc</a> tribes, evil clerics, or <a href=\"/appendix/gnoll\">gnolls</a>. They mingle freely with giants and <a href=\"/appendix/troll\">trolls</a>.</p><p>Adult ogres stand 9 to 10 feet tall and weigh 300 to 350 pounds. Their skin colors range from a dead yellow to a dull black-brown, and (rarely) a sickly violet. Their warty bumps are often of a different color - or at least darker than their hides. Their eyes are purple with white pupils. Teeth and talons are orange or black. Ogres have long, greasy hair of blackish-blue to dull dark green. Their odor is repellent, reminiscent of curdled milk. Dressing in poorly cured furs and animal hides, they care for their weapons and armor only reasonably well. It is common for ogres to speak orc, troll, <a href=\"/appendix/gianston\">stone giant</a>, and gnoll, as well as their own guttural language. A typical ogre's life span is 90 years.</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Combat:</b> In small numbers, ogres fight as unorganized individuals, but groups of 11 or more will have a leader, and groups of 16 or more usually include two leaders and a chieftain. Ogres wielding weapons get a Strength bonus of +2 to hit; leaders have +3, chieftains have +4. Females fight as males but score only 2-8 points of damage and have a maximum of only 6 hit points per die. Young ogres fight as <a href=\"/appendix/goblin\">goblins</a>.</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Habitat/Society:</b> Ogre tribes are found anywhere, from deep caverns to mountaintops. Tribes have 16-20 males, 2-12 females, and 2-8 young. Shamans, if present, will be of 3rd level, and have access to the spheres of combat, divination, healing, protection, and sun (darkness only). Ogres live by raiding and scavenging and they will eat anything. Their fondness for <a href=\"/appendix/elf\">elf</a>, <a href=\"/appendix/dwarf\">dwarf</a>, and <a href=\"/appendix/halfling\">halfling</a> flesh means that there is only a 10% chance that these will be found as slaves or prisoners. There is a 30% chance that an ogre lair will include 2-8 slaves. Captured prisoners are always kept as slaves (25%) or food (75%). Extremely avaricious, ogres squabble over treasure and cannot be trusted, even by their own kind.</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Ecology:</b> Ogres consistently plague mankind, lusting for gold, gems, and jewelry as well as human flesh. They are evil-natured creatures that join with other monsters to prey on the weak and favor overwhelming odds to a fair fight. Ogres make no crafts nor labor.</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Ogre Leader</b></p>  <p class=\"ni\">When more than 11 ogres are encountered, a leader will be present. He is a 7 Hit Dice monster with 30-33 hit points and Armor Class 3. He inflicts 5-15 (2d6+3) points of damage per attack, +6 with weapon.</p><p></p><p class=\"f\"><b>Ogre Chieftain</b></p>  <p class=\"ni\">If 16 or more ogres are encountered, they will be led by two patrol leaders and a chieftain. The chieftain is a 7 Hit Dice monster with 34-37 hit points and Armor Class 4. He inflicts 8-18 (2d6+6) points of damage per attack, +6 with weapon. Chieftains are usually the biggest and smartest ogres in their tribes.</p><p></p><h2><img src=\"/img/spc/ogremage.gif\" width=\"300\" height=\"360\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Ogre Mage\" title=\"Ogre Mage\" style=\"float:left;\">Ogre Mage</h2><p class=\"f\">The oriental ogre has light blue, light green, or pale brown skin with ivory horns. The hair is usually a different color (blue with green, green with blue) and is darker in shade; the main exception to this coloration is found in ogre magi with pale brown skin and yellow hair. They have black nails and dark eyes with white pupils. The teeth and tusks are very white. Ogre magi are taller and more intelligent than their cousins and they dress in oriental clothing and armor.</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Combat:</b> Ogre magi can perform the following feats of magic: <i>fly</i> (for 12 turns), <i>become invisible</i>, <i>cause darkness</i> in a 10-foot radius, <i>polymorph</i> to a human or similar bipedal creature (4 feet to 12 feet tall), and <i>regenerate</i> one hit point per round (lost members must be reattached to regenerate). Once per day they can do the following: <i>charm person</i>, <i>sleep</i>, <i>assume gaseous form</i>, and create a <i>cone of cold</i> 60 feet long with a terminal diameter of 20 feet, which inflicts 8-64 (8d8) points of damage (save vs. spell for half damage). Oriental ogres attack with magic first and resort to physical attacks only if necessary. They are +1 on morale.</p><p>In battle, ogre magi prefer the naganata (75%) or scimitar and whip (25%). Those found in oriental settings might (25%) possess ki power or have mastered a martial arts form. As ogre magi are intelligent, they will not fight if faced with overwhelming odds, but will flee to gather their forces or hide.</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Habitat/Society:</b> These monsters live in fortified dwellings or caves and foray to capture slaves, treasure, and food. Ogre magi priests of up to 7th level have been reported. Tribes are small, with 2-5 females and 1-3 children that will not fight, but rather seek to escape in gaseous form. These monsters are extremely protective of their young and will battle with savage abandon to save one's life. If a young ogre mage is captured, these creatures will pay high ransom for its return, but they will seek revenge and will never forget the insult of the kidnaping.</p><p>If encountered in their lair, ogre magi will be led by a chief of great strength (+2 on each Hit Die, attacking and saving as a 9 Hit Dice monster). Treasure is divided by this chief and his trove is always the richest. The tribe will have their own clan symbol typical to the oriental lands, and this symbol will be stitched on its war banners and flags as well as on armor and headdresses. The chief will often have the tribe's symbol tattooed on his forehead or back.</p><p>Ogre magi speak the common tongue, their own special language, and the speech of normal ogres.</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Ecology:</b> Ogre magi magical armor is too large to fit a man. This monster's lair is usually a powerful structure that can be expanded into a mighty fortress if it can be rid of its original owners.</p><h2>Merrow (Aquatic Ogre)</h2><p class=\"f\">Faster and fiercer than their land kin, the freshwater merrow are greenish and scaled with webbed hands and feet. Their necks are long and thick, their shoulders are sloping, and they have huge mouths and undershot jaws. Merrow have black teeth and nails and deep green eyes with white centers, and their hair resembles slimy seaweed. About 10% grow ivory horns, especially the more powerful males.</p><p>Aquatic ogres are very fond of tattoos, and females may have their entire bodies inked with scenes of death and destruction as a sign of status. Merrow speak their own dialect and the language of other ogres.</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Combat:</b> Using their green coloration, aquatic ogres can hide, becoming effectively invisible 10-80% of the time, depending on terrain. They attack from cover, so others are -5 on their surprise roll. Merrow typically attack with a large piercing spear (inflicting 2-12 points of damage) in a swimming charge at +1 to hit, followed by melee with talons and teeth.</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Habitat/Society:</b> A typical merrow tribe consists of:</p><ul><li>1 chief, AC3, 6+6 Hit Dice, +2 on damage</li><li>2 patrol leaders, AC3, 5+5 Hit Dice, +1 on damage</li><li>2-24 standard merrow</li><li>2-24 females, AC5, 3+3 Hit Dice, 1-2/1-2/1-6 damage</li><li>1-12 young, AC6, 2+2 Hit Dice, 1-2/1-2/1-4 damage</li><li>1 shaman of 3rd level ability</li></ul><p>Merrow dwell in caves in shallow, fresh water (50-250 feet deep), often with scrags (see Troll). They can live out of water for about two hours, so they often forage on land. Merrow usually control an area with a radius of 10-15 miles, hunting and foraging throughout this territory. In times of scarcity, or when the lure of treasure becomes too great, a war party will attack the coastal villages of man. Merrow prefer gold and jewels and often overlook dull magical items in search of glittering prizes. The goals of a merrow chieftain rule the tribe, and these power-hungry monsters seek to completely control their &ldquo;kingdoms&rdquo;, often leading to attacks on intruding ships.</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Ecology:</b> Merrow are ignorant and superstitious and have no skills but plundering and murder. Areas of the freshwater lakes and seas where they have influence are avoided by sailors and fishermen. These monsters are carnivores, preying on all who enter their regions, often emptying the seas of life with their voracious appetites.</p><br clear=\"all\" style=\"clear:both; height:0;\">\r\n","images":["<img src=\"grf/xx.gif\" width=\"150\" height=\"75\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Advanced Dungeons & Dragons 2nd Edition\" title=\"Advanced Dungeons & Dragons 2nd Edition\" align=\"right\">","<img src=\"img/ogre.gif\" alt=\"Ogre\" title=\"Ogre\" border=\"0\" width=\"300\" height=\"360\" style=\"text-align:right;\" align=\"right\">","<img src=\"/img/spc/ogremage.gif\" width=\"300\" height=\"360\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Ogre Mage\" title=\"Ogre Mage\" style=\"float:left;\">","<img src=\"grf/tsr_sm.png\" width=\"56\" height=\"59\" border=\"0\" alt=\"TSR\">"],"setting":"Advanced Dungeons & Dragons 2nd Edition","statblock":{"Merrow":{"Activity Cycle":"Any","Alignment":"Chaotic evil","Armor Class":"4","Climate/Terrain":"Any water","Damage/Attack":"1-6/1-6/2-8 (or by weapon +6)","Diet":"Carnivore","Frequency":"Uncommon","Hit Dice":"4+4","Intelligence":"Average (8-10)","Magic Resistance":"Nil","Morale":"Steady (11-12)","Movement":"6, Sw 12","No. Appearing":"2-24 (2d12)","No. of Attacks":"3 or 1","Organization":"Tribal","Size":"Large (9')","Special Attacks":"See below","Special Defenses":"Camouflage","THAC0":"15","Treasure":"M (A)","XP Value":"420<br>Leader: 650<br>Chieftain: 975"},"Ogre":{"Activity Cycle":"Any","Alignment":"Chaotic evil","Armor Class":"5","Climate/Terrain":"Any land","Damage/Attack":"1-10 (or by weapon +6)","Diet":"Carnivore","Frequency":"Common","Hit Dice":"4+1","Intelligence":"Low (8)","Magic Resistance":"Nil","Morale":"Steady (11-12)","Movement":"9","No. Appearing":"2-20 (2d10)","No. of Attacks":"1","Organization":"Tribal","Size":"Large (9'+)","Special Attacks":"+2 to damage","Special Defenses":"Nil","THAC0":"17","Treasure":"M (Q,B,S)","XP Value":"270<br>Leader: 650<br>Chieftain: 975"},"Ogre Mage":{"Activity Cycle":"Any","Alignment":"Lawful evil","Armor Class":"4","Climate/Terrain":"Any oriental land","Damage/Attack":"1-12","Diet":"Carnivore","Frequency":"Very rare","Hit Dice":"5+2","Intelligence":"Average to exceptional (9-16)","Magic Resistance":"Nil","Morale":"Elite (13-14)","Movement":"9, Fl 15 (B)","No. Appearing":"1-6","No. of Attacks":"1","Organization":"Tribal","Size":"Large (10&#189;')","Special Attacks":"Magic spells","Special Defenses":"Nil","THAC0":"15","Treasure":"G (R,S, magic)","XP Value":"650<br>Chieftain: 975"}},"title":"Ogre"},"sources":["2102","2140"],"statblock_names":[],"title":"Ogre","prev_key":"odem","next_key":"ogrehalf","monster_path":"/appendix/ogre"}},"staticQueryHashes":[],"slicesMap":{}}
