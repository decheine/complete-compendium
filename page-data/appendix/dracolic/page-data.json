While the powers listed above are the most common, some aarakocra have different or additional powers.</p><p class=\"f\">A race of intelligent, birdlike creatures living in the deepest deserts of Athas, the rare Athasian <a href=\"/appendix/aarakocr\">aarakocra</a> spends its time soaring on thermals in search of food.</p><p>The aarakocra is 7 to 8 feet tall with a wingspan of 20 feet or more. Because of its large wingspan, an aarakocra can carry as much as 75% of its own body weight and still fly easily. An aarakocra can fly a short distance carrying a burden equaling 125% of its own body weight. The average body weight of a full grown male is 100 pounds and a female is 85 pounds.</p><p>Each wing has a &ldquo;hand&rdquo; at its midpoint, consisting of three fingers and an opposable thumb. The fourth finger forms the rigid leading edge of the wing. In flight the hands cannot be used, but on the ground the aarakocra can use its hands almost as a human would. The aarakocra's body is protected by a thin bony plate on the chest, much like a solid rib cage. Talons on its legs can be used as claws and can be retracted to reveal a second set of hands, also with three fingers and an opposable thumb. Except for the chest plate, the entire skeleton is hollow and extremely fragile.</p><p>From a distance, the Athasian aarakocra resembles a huge <a href=\"/appendix/bird\">vulture</a>. Its black eyes, set in the front of the head, provide excellent vision over a long range. The plumage is generally black with a white collar for adult males and black or brown with a smaller white collar for females. Adolescents are a mixture of brown and black. The beak is large and covers most of the head. Plumage begins at the crown of the head and is darker near the head, except for the collar. Athasian aarakocra speak their own language and the languages of vultures and other large birds. Some speak the common tongue (5% to 10% chance depending on how deep in the wastelands a tribe lives).</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Combat:</b> Aarakocra can fight in the air or on the ground. They prefer aerial combat since their bones are too fragile to withstand a solid blow from a human-sized opponent. In combat against creatures on the ground, they prefer to fly over their victim and drop weighted nets. Some aarakocra use darts to harass ground-based opponents.</p><p>If their opponents can fly, the aarakocra generally forgo the use of the net, although large groups sometimes use nets on flying creatures. Normally, aarakocra attack flying creatures with long spears, diving from above and allowing the momentum to carry the spear through the target. Such an attack doubles the damage if the aarakocra have been able to dive at least 50 feet. Only the very largest aarakocra can carry more than one of these spears, they can attack with both at once with no penalty, causing double damage on each strike. All diving attacks are made at +4 and should be treated as a charge attack. All other penalties and restrictions of charge attacks apply.</p><p>The effect of the aarakocra's nets depends on if the opponent is flying at the time it becomes entangled. Creatures on the ground that are hit by a net are entangled and unable to participate in any combat until they make a successful Strength check to get free of the net. Flying creatures hit by a net can no longer fly and immediately begin falling. If they cannot escape the net or use some magical means to arrest the fall, normal falling damage applies.</p><p>Unless victims are entangled in nets, aarakocra are cautious in ground combat. If the aarakocra outnumber their opponents they advance in a straight line and thrust with their spears. If outnumbered, or the opponents are particularly tough, the aarakocra withdraw. Victims entangled in nets are killed or incapacitated for use as food or ransom.</p><p>Athasian aarakocra are mindful of their physical limitations as well as their comparatively low psionic abilities. They do not normally initiate psionic combat. At the first sign of psionic powers from any of their victims, however, all aarakocra that have some ability will use whatever attack and defense modes they can in an attempt to destroy the threat. Large groups of is or more aarakocra may initiate psionic combat if their leaders feel they can win quickly and avoid physical combat.</p><p>In desperation, an aarakocra can attempt to bite an opponent in combat. Because of the unwieldiness of its beak, the aarakocra has a THAC0 of 18 if attacking with this appendage. Further, the birdman causes only 1d2 points of damage with the beak.</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Habitat/Society:</b> Athasian aarakocra live in tribes with 6-20 (2d8+4) members, depending on the prestige of the leader. The largest tribe ever recorded had 50 members. The tribal hunting territory depends on the size of the tribe, usually about 500 square miles for a tribe of 10 members. There are no rigid boundaries between tribes and border disputes are not uncommon.</p><p>Alignments of tribe members are similar to the alignment of the leader. A tribe that has a leader who is neutral good may have neutral good, chaotic good, lawful good, and true neutral members. A predominantly evil tribe does not recognize boundaries with other tribes and treats other tribes as inferior beings to be eliminated.</p><p>Athasian aarakocra aren't happy in enclosed spaces, but they they take refuge in a cave or building if necessary.</p><p>Nonevil tribes live in rocky aeries in the highest peaks they can find. Evil tribes are normally nomadic and use an aerie made by another tribe if they need to remain in an area for a long time, even if they have to evict the tribe that made the nest.</p><p>Aarakocra aren't friendly toward intruders in their territory, especially caravans. They try to extract a toll from the caravan for passage through the desert. Good-aligned tribes allow unhindered passage of caravans that pay a tribute. If someone refuses to pay the tribute, the aarakocra try to capture scouts or outriders from the party and hold them until an even larger tribute is paid. The payment may be either livestock or shiny objects. Aarakocra are smart enough not to be taken in by glass baubles instead of gems, although they cannot tell the difference between the more common gems and the rare ones.</p><p>Evil tribes ask for tribute and often attack a caravan whether it pays or not. Aarakocra always demand shiny objects such as stones. These tribes find humans and demihumans to be quite tasty and prefer them to other food.</p><p>Good-aligned tribes of aarakocra sometimes return a lost traveler to the edge of the desert after first removing any valuables the traveler may be carrying. On very rare occasions a tribe might return a lost group of travelers to the more frequently traveled parts of the desert, again after first taking any valuables as payment.</p><p>The oldest male is the leader of the tribal hunting party and has 4+4 Hit Dice. The oldest female is in charge of the tribal aerie and has 3+3 HD. In tribes that have more than 15 members, the next oldest aarakocra serves as shaman and has 3+3 HD; the shaman completes the triumvirate necessary for proper worship and the summoning of elementals. (Interestingly, no magic-using aarakocra has ever been recorded.) Tribes without a shaman cannot summon <a href=\"/appendix/element1\">air elementals</a>, which is an important part of aarakocra culture.</p><p>The shaman is the leader of the daily sun worship. Aarakocra worship the sun because it provides them with the thermals they need to soar in search of food. The shaman also leads the mystic rituals used to summon an air elemental. Summoning an air elemental is usually done only in preparation for the tribe's most sacred ceremony, the hunt. Small tribes must band together for this ceremony to allow the triumvirate to be formed.</p><p>The ceremony to summon an air elemental must be conducted at dawn and requires the oldest male and female to emit a highpitched keening whistle. The shaman conducts an intricate dance around them, simultaneously chanting an ancient summoning mantra.</p><p>The hunt is the final part of the initiation of adolescent aarakocra to adulthood and often takes the tribe far from their normal teritory. The target is always a <a href=\"/appendix/drakalsi\">silt drake</a>. The hunt is the only time the females leave the relative safety of the nest. Even an evil tribe will not interfere with a tribe on a hunt. An air elemental is often summoned to help find the drake, but never takes part in the actual combat. Although the adult members of the tribe take part in the initial phases of the combat, it is the initiates who deliver the final, killing blows to me drake. Scars from the hunt are considered a mark of pride among all aarakocra.</p><p>The females spend about eight months of the year incubating their eggs. Athasian aarakocra mate for life and a pair normally produces as many as 10 offspring. A female lays one egg a year. Constant incubation is not required because of the high daytime temperatures, so the females can maintain the nest and keep the tribe's treasure in order.</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Ecology:</b> Athasian aarakocra are high on the food chain and have no natural enemies other than <a href=\"/appendix/drakatha\">drakes</a>. Unless evil, aarakocra leave their own territory only to hunt the silt drake and return as soon as possible when the hunt is over. (Evil aarakocra attack others, as noted above.) Aarakocra eggs and hatchlings are sought after by wealthy land owners who wish to use the creatures as scouts and sentries. An egg can bring as much as 10 cp in Tyr's marketplace. Tribes that have had eggs or hatchlings stolen have long memories and sometimes take revenge against the thief at a later date. Captive aarakocra join any tribe they come in contact with.</p><p>Athasian aarakocra have a natural life span of 21-30 years.</p>\n","images":["<img src=\"grf/ds.gif\" width=\"150\" height=\"75\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Dark Sun\" title=\"Dark Sun\" align=\"right\">","<img src=\"img/aarakath.gif\" alt=\"Aarakocra (Athas)\" title=\"Aarakocra (Athas)\" border=\"0\" width=\"300\" height=\"360\" style=\"text-align:right;\" align=\"right\">","<img src=\"grf/add2_01.gif\" width=\"200\" height=\"56\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Advanced Dungeons & Dragons 2nd Edition\">"],"setting":"Dark Sun","statblock":{"Aarakocra (Athas)":{"Activity Cycle":"Day","Alignment":"Any","Armor Class":"7","Climate/Terrain":"Deep desert","Damage/Attack":"1d3/1d3 or by weapon","Diet":"Carnivore","Frequency":"Rare","Hit Dice":"2+2","Intelligence":"Average (8-10)","Magic Resistance":"Nil","Morale":"Steady (11)","Movement":"6, Fl 36 (C)","No. Appearing":"1d10","No. of Attacks":"2","Organization":"Tribal","Size":"M (20'+ wingspan)","Special Attacks":"Nil","Special Defenses":"Nil","THAC0":"17","Treasure":"Varies","XP Value":"65"}},"title":"Aarakocra (Athas)"},"sources":["2433"],"statblock_names":[],"title":"Aarakocra (Athas)","prev_key":"zygraat","next_key":"aarakocr","monster_path":"/appendix/aarakath"}}},"pageContext":{"monster_key":"dracolic","monster_data":{"TSR":["2140","9547","1085","2104"],"fullBody":"  <table cellspacing=\"0\" cellpadding=\"0\"><tr><th>Climate/Terrain:</th><td>As per former dragon type</td></tr><tr><th>Frequency:</th><td>Very rare</td></tr><tr><th>Organization:</th><td>Solitary</td></tr><tr><th>Activity Cycle:</th><td>Night</td></tr><tr><th>Diet:</th><td>None required for sustenance, but as per former dragon type to refuel breath weapon</td></tr><tr><th>Intelligence:</th><td>As per individual dragon</td></tr><tr><th>Treasure:</th><td>B,H,S,T</td></tr><tr><th>Alignment:</th><td>Lawful evil, neutral evil, or chaotic evil (as per former dragon type; nonevil dragons become evil on transformation)</td></tr><tr><th>No. Appearing:</th><td>1</td></tr><tr><th>Armor Class:</th><td>As per former dragon type with an additional -2 bonus to AC</td></tr><tr><th>Movement:</th><td>As per former dragon type and age</td></tr><tr><th>Hit Dice:</th><td>As per former dragon type and age</td></tr><tr><th>THAC0:</th><td>As per former dragon type and age</td></tr><tr><th>No. of Attacks:</th><td>As per former dragon type, typically 3 + special</td></tr><tr><th>Damage/Attack:</th><td>As per former dragon type and age + 2d8 points of cold damage per successful attack + 2d6 rounds of paralysis (save vs. paralysis allowed)</td></tr><tr><th>Special Attacks:</th><td>Breath weapon, spell use, paralyzing gaze, undead control</td></tr><tr><th>Special Defenses:</th><td>Strengthened dragon fear aura; immune to <i>charm</i>, <i>sleep</i>, <i>enfeeblement</i>, <i>polymorph</i>, cold (magical or normal), electricity, <i>hold</i>, insanity, or <i>death</i> spells or symbols, poison, paralysis, and turning; no attack or damage roll bonuses allowed against them; injured only by magical attacks from 6th-level or greater wizards or by attacks from 6 or more HD monsters</td></tr><tr><th>Magic Resistance:</th><td>As per former dragon type and age</td></tr><tr><th>Size:</th><td>As per individual dragon</td></tr><tr><th>Morale:</th><td>As per former dragon type until specific circumstances occur (see below), then Fearless (19-20)</td></tr><tr><th>XP Value:</th><td>As per individual dragon, plus 1,000 (both body and host must be destroyed)</td></tr></table><p class=\"f\">The dracolich is an undead creature resulting from the unnatural transformation of a <a href=\"/appendix/dragon\">dragon</a>. The mysterious Cult of the Dragon practices the powerful magic necessary for the creation of the dracolich, though other practitioners are also rumored to exist.</p><p>A dracolich can be created from any of the evil or neutral dragon subspecies. An evil or neutral dracolich retains the physical appearance of its original body, except that its eyes appear as glowing points of light floating in shadowy eye sockets. Skeletal or semiskeletal dracoliches have been observed on occasion.</p><p>The senses of a dracolich are similar to those of its original form, and it can detect invisible objects or creatures (including those hidden in darkness or fog) within a 10-foot radius per age category and also possess a natural clairaudience ability while in its lair equal to a range of 20 feet per age category. A dracolich can speak, cast spells, and employ the breath weapon of its original form. It can cast each of its spells once per day and can use its breath weapon once every three combat rounds. A dracolich retains the memories and intelligence of its original form.</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Combat:</b> Dracoliches are immune to <i>charm</i>, <i>sleep</i>, <i>enfeeblement</i>, <i>polymorph</i>, cold (magical or normal), electricity, <i>hold</i>, insanity, or <i>death</i> spells or symbols. They cannot be poisoned, paralyzed, or turned by priests. They have the same magic resistance as their original forms, but only magical attacks from wizards of 6th level or higher or attacks from monsters of 6 or more Hit Dice can injure dracoliches.</p><p>The Armor Class of a dracolich is equal to the Armor Class of its original form bettered by -2 (for example, if the AC of the original form is -1, the AC of the dracolich is -3). Attacks on the dracolich, due to its magical nature, do not gain any attack or damage roll bonuses.</p><p>Initially, a dracolich has the same morale rating as its original form. However, after a dracolich is successful in its first battle, its morale rating permanently becomes Fearless (19 base). This assumes that the opponent or opponents involved in the battle had a Hit Dice total of at least 100% of the Hit Dice of the dracolich. (For instance, a 16-HD dracolich must defeat an opponent or opponents of at least 16 total HD in one battle to receive the morale increase.) Once a dracolich receives the morale increase, it becomes immune to magical fear as well.</p><p>The dracolich has a slightly stronger ability to cause fear in opponents than it did in its original form (a dragon's fear aura). Opponents must roll their saving throws vs. spell with a -1 penalty (in addition to any other relevant modifiers) to resist the dracolich.s fear aura. The gaze of the dracolich's glowing eyes can also paralyze creatures within 40 yards if they fail their saving throws. (Creatures of 6th level or 6 Hit Dice or higher gain a +3 bonus to their saving throws.) If a creature successfully saves against the paralyzing gaze of a dracolich, it is permanently immune to the gaze of that particular dracolich.</p><p>The attack routine of a dracolich is similar to that of its original form. For example, a dracolich that was originally a <a href=\"/appendix/dragcgre\">green dragon</a> brings down a weak opponent with a series of physical attacks, but it stalks more formidable opponents, attacking at an opportune moment with its breath weapon and spells.</p><p>All physical attacks, such as clawing and biting, inflict the same damage as the dracolich's original form plus 2d8 points of chilling damage. A victim struck by a dracolich who fails a saving throw vs. paralyzation is paralyzed for 2d6 rounds. Immunity to cold damage, temporary or permanent, negates the chilling damage but not the paralyzation. Dracoliches cannot drain life levels.</p><p>All dracoliches can attempt <i>undead control</i> (as per the <i>potion of undead control</i>) once every three days on any variety of undead within 60 yards. The undead creatures' saving throws against this power suffer a -3 penalty. If the <i>undead control</i> is successful, it lasts for one turn only. While <i>undead control</i> is in use, the dracolich cannot use its spells. If the dracolich interrupts its <i>undead control</i> before it has been used for a full turn, the dracolich must still wait three days before the power can be used again.</p><p>If a dracolich or proto-dracolich is slain, its spirit immediately returns to its host (see below). If there is no corpse in range for it to possess, the spirit is trapped in the host until such a time - if ever - that a corpse becomes available.</p><p>A dracolich is difficult to destroy. It can be destroyed outright by a <i>power word, kill</i> or a similar spell. If its spirit is currently contained in its host, destroying the host when a suitable corpse in not within range effectively destroys the dracolich. Likewise, an active dracolich is unable to attempt further possessions if its host is destroyed. The fate of a disembodied dracolich spirit - that is, a spirit with no body and no host - is unknown, but it is presumed that it is drawn to the lower planes.</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Habitat/Society:</b> The creation of a dracolich is a complex process involving the transformation of an evil or neutral dragon by arcane magical forces, the most notorious practitioners of which are the members of the Cult of the Dragon. The process is usually a cooperative effort between the evil dragon and wizards and/or priests, but especially powerful wizards and priests have been known to coerce an evil dragon to undergo the transformation against its will. Priest versions of this procedure are similar to the wizardly version described here, but priests still need a wizard's assistance for certain aspects of the transformation process, while wizards never need a priest's aid - though it is sometimes welcomed. The church of Tiamat, in particular, is working to eliminate the requirements for wizardly assistance.</p><p>Any dragon is a possible candidate for transformation, although evil spell-casting dragons of old or older age are preferred. Once a candidate is secured, the wizards first prepare the dragon's host, an inanimate object that will hold the dragon's life force. The host must be a solid item of not less than 2,000 gp value resistant to decay (wood, for instance, is unsuitable). A gemstone is commonly used for a host, particularly ruby, pearl, carbuncle, jet, chalcedony, chrysocolla, citrine, epidote, moonbar, and morion (smoky quartz). The gemstone is often (though not always, by all means) set in the hilt of a sword or other weapon. The host is prepared by casting an <i>enchant an item</i> upon it and speaking the name of the evil dragon. The item may resist the spell by succeeding at a saving throw vs. spell as if it were an 11th-level wizard. If the spell is resisted, another item must be used for the host. If the spell is not resisted, the item can then function as a host. If desired, glassteel can be cast upon the host to protect it.</p><p>Next a special potion is prepared for the dragon to consume. The exact composition of the potion varies according to the age and type of the dragon, but it must contain precisely seven ingredients, among them a <i>potion of evil dragon control</i>, a <i>potion of invulnerability</i>, and the blood of a <a href=\"/appendix/vampire\">vampire</a>. When the dragon consumes the potion, the results are determined as follows (roll percentile dice):</p><table class=\"ip\"><tr class=\"bk\"><th>Roll</th><th>Result</th></tr><tr><td style=\"min-width: 50px;\"><nobr>01-10</nobr></td><td>No effect.</td></tr><tr><td style=\"min-width: 50px;\">11-40</td><td>Potion does not work. The dragon suffers 2d12 points of damage and is helpless with convulsions for 1d2 rounds.</td></tr><tr><td style=\"min-width: 50px;\">41-50</td><td>Potion does not work. The dragon dies. A full <i>wish</i> is required to restore the dragon to life. A <i>wish</i> to transform the dragon into a dracolich results in another roll on this table.</td></tr><tr><td style=\"min-width: 50px;\">51-00</td><td>Potion works.</td></tr></table><p>If the potion works, the dragon's spirit transfers to the host, regardless of the distance between the dragon's body and the host. A dim light within the host indicates the presence of the spirit. While contained in the host, the spirit cannot take any actions; it cannot be contacted nor attacked by magic. The spirit can remain in the host indefinitely.</p><p>Once the spirit is contained in the host, the host must be brought within 90 feet of a reptilian corpse.under no circumstances can the spirit possess a living body. The spirit's original body is ideal, but the corpse of any reptilian creature that died or was killed within the previous 30 days is suitable.</p><p>The wizard who originally prepared the host must touch the host, cast a <i>magic jar</i> spell while speaking the name of the dragon, then touch the corpse. The corpse must fail a saving throw vs. spell for the spirit to successfully possess it; if it saves, it will never accept the spirit. The following modifiers apply to the roll:</p><ul><li>-10 if the corpse is the spirit's own former body (which can be dead for any length of time).</li><li>-4 if the corpse is of the same alignment as the dragon.</li><li>-4 if the corpse is that of a true dragon (any type).</li><li>-3 if the corpse is that of a <a href=\"/appendix/drnefidr\">firedrake</a>, <a href=\"/appendix/icelizar\">ice lizard</a>, <a href=\"/appendix/wyvern\">wyvern</a>, or <a href=\"/appendix/lizard\">fire lizard</a>.</li><li>-1 if the corpse is that of a <a href=\"/appendix/basilisk\">dracolisk</a>, <a href=\"/appendix/drgonne\">dragonne</a>, <a href=\"/appendix/dinosau1\">dinosaur</a>, <a href=\"/appendix/snake\">snake</a>, or other reptile.</li></ul><p>If the corpse accepts the spirit, it becomes animated by the spirit. If the animated corpse is the spirit's former body, it immediately becomes a dracolich; however, it will not regain the use of its voice and breath weapon for another seven days. (Note that it will not be able to cast spells with verbal components during this time.) At the end of seven days, the dracolich regains use of its voice and breath weapon.</p><p>If the animated corpse is not the spirit's former body, it immediately becomes a proto-dracolich. A proto-dracolich has the mind and memories of its original form but has the hit points and immunities to spells and priestly turning of a dracolich. A proto-dracolich can neither speak or cast spells; further, it cannot cause chilling damage, use a breath weapon, control undead, paralyze with its eyes, or cause fear as a dracolich. Its Strength, movement, and Armor Class are those of the possessed body.</p><p>To become a full dracolich, a proto-dracolich must devour 10% of its original body. Unless the body has been dispatched to another plane of existence, a proto-dracolich can always sense the presence of its original body regardless of the distance. A proto-dracolich tirelessly seeks out its original body to the exclusion of all other activities. If its original body has been burned, dismembered, or otherwise destroyed, the proto-dracolich need only devour the ashes or pieces equal to 10% of its original body mass. (Total destruction of the original body is only possible through the use of a <i>disintegrate</i> or similar spell; the body could be reconstructed with a <i>wish</i> or similar spell, so long as the spell is cast in the same plane as the disintegration.) If a proto-dracolich is unable to devour its original body, it is trapped in its current state until slain.</p><p>A proto-dracolich transforms into a full dracolich seven days days after its devours its original body. When the transformation is complete, the dracolich resembles its original body: It can now speak, cast spells, and employ the breath weapon of its original body in addition to having all the abilities of a dracolich.</p><p>The procedure for possessing a new corpse is the same as explained above, except the assistance of a wizard is no longer necessary since casting <i>magic jar</i> is required only for the first possession. If the spirit successfully repossesses its original body it once again becomes a full dracolich. If the spirit possesses a different body it becomes a proto-dracolich and must devour its former body to become a full dracolich.</p><p>A symbiotic relationship exists between a dracolich and the wizards and/or priests who create it. The group that creates the dracolich honors and aids its dracolich, as well as providing it with regular offerings of treasure items. In return, the dracolich defends its animating organization (or individual) against enemies and other threats, as well as assisting it in its members. various schemes. Like dragons, dracoliches are loners, but they take comfort in the knowledge that they have allies.</p><p>Dracoliches are always found in the same habitats as the dragons from which they were created. Dracoliches created from green dragons, for instance, are likely to be found in subtropical or temperate forests. Though they do not live with their creators, dracoliches' lairs are never more than a few miles away from them or at least one of their regular meeting places or refuges. Dracoliches prefer darkness and are usually encountered at night, in shadowy forests, or in underground labyrinths. Dracoliches continue to age just as dragons do, becoming more powerful as they enter new age categories.</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Ecology:</b> Dracoliches are never hungry, but they must eat in order to refuel their breath weapon. Like dragons, dracoliches can consume nearly anything, but prefer the food eaten by their original forms. (For instance, if a dracolich was originally a <a href=\"/appendix/dragcred\">red dragon</a>, it prefers fresh meat.) The body of a destroyed dracolich crumbles into a foulsmelling powder with a few hours. This powder can be used by knowledgeable wizards as a component for creating <i>potions of undead control</i> and similar magical substances.</p>\n","images":["<img src=\"grf/xx.gif\" width=\"150\" height=\"75\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Advanced Dungeons & Dragons 2nd Edition\" title=\"Advanced Dungeons & Dragons 2nd Edition\" align=\"right\">","<img src=\"img/dracolic.gif\" alt=\"Dracolich\" title=\"Dracolich\" border=\"0\" width=\"300\" height=\"360\" style=\"text-align:right;\" align=\"right\">","<img src=\"grf/tsr_sm.png\" width=\"56\" height=\"59\" border=\"0\" alt=\"TSR\">"],"setting":"Advanced Dungeons & Dragons 2nd Edition","statblock":{"Dracolich":{"Activity Cycle":"Night","Alignment":"Lawful evil, neutral evil, or chaotic evil (as per former dragon type; nonevil dragons become evil on transformation)","Armor Class":"As per former dragon type with an additional -2 bonus to AC","Climate/Terrain":"As per former dragon type","Damage/Attack":"As per former dragon type and age + 2d8 points of cold damage per successful attack + 2d6 rounds of paralysis (save vs. paralysis allowed)","Diet":"None required for sustenance, but as per former dragon type to refuel breath weapon","Frequency":"Very rare","Hit Dice":"As per former dragon type and age","Intelligence":"As per individual dragon","Magic Resistance":"As per former dragon type and age","Morale":"As per former dragon type until specific circumstances occur (see below), then Fearless (19-20)","Movement":"As per former dragon type and age","No. Appearing":"1","No. of Attacks":"As per former dragon type, typically 3 + special","Organization":"Solitary","Size":"As per individual dragon","Special Attacks":"Breath weapon, spell use, paralyzing gaze, undead control","Special Defenses":"Strengthened dragon fear aura; immune to <i>charm</i>, <i>sleep</i>, <i>enfeeblement</i>, <i>polymorph</i>, cold (magical or normal), electricity, <i>hold</i>, insanity, or <i>death</i> spells or symbols, poison, paralysis, and turning; no attack or damage roll bonuses allowed against them; injured only by magical attacks from 6th-level or greater wizards or by attacks from 6 or more HD monsters","THAC0":"As per former dragon type and age","Treasure":"B,H,S,T","XP Value":"As per individual dragon, plus 1,000 (both body and host must be destroyed)"}},"title":"Dracolich"},"sources":["2140","9547","1085","2104"],"statblock_names":[],"title":"Dracolich","prev_key":"dracohyd","next_key":"dracon","monster_path":"/appendix/dracolic"}},"staticQueryHashes":[],"slicesMap":{}}
