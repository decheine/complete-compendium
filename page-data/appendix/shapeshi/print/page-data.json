While the powers listed above are the most common, some aarakocra have different or additional powers.</p><p class=\"f\">A race of intelligent, birdlike creatures living in the deepest deserts of Athas, the rare Athasian <a href=\"/appendix/aarakocr\">aarakocra</a> spends its time soaring on thermals in search of food.</p><p>The aarakocra is 7 to 8 feet tall with a wingspan of 20 feet or more. Because of its large wingspan, an aarakocra can carry as much as 75% of its own body weight and still fly easily. An aarakocra can fly a short distance carrying a burden equaling 125% of its own body weight. The average body weight of a full grown male is 100 pounds and a female is 85 pounds.</p><p>Each wing has a &ldquo;hand&rdquo; at its midpoint, consisting of three fingers and an opposable thumb. The fourth finger forms the rigid leading edge of the wing. In flight the hands cannot be used, but on the ground the aarakocra can use its hands almost as a human would. The aarakocra's body is protected by a thin bony plate on the chest, much like a solid rib cage. Talons on its legs can be used as claws and can be retracted to reveal a second set of hands, also with three fingers and an opposable thumb. Except for the chest plate, the entire skeleton is hollow and extremely fragile.</p><p>From a distance, the Athasian aarakocra resembles a huge <a href=\"/appendix/bird\">vulture</a>. Its black eyes, set in the front of the head, provide excellent vision over a long range. The plumage is generally black with a white collar for adult males and black or brown with a smaller white collar for females. Adolescents are a mixture of brown and black. The beak is large and covers most of the head. Plumage begins at the crown of the head and is darker near the head, except for the collar. Athasian aarakocra speak their own language and the languages of vultures and other large birds. Some speak the common tongue (5% to 10% chance depending on how deep in the wastelands a tribe lives).</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Combat:</b> Aarakocra can fight in the air or on the ground. They prefer aerial combat since their bones are too fragile to withstand a solid blow from a human-sized opponent. In combat against creatures on the ground, they prefer to fly over their victim and drop weighted nets. Some aarakocra use darts to harass ground-based opponents.</p><p>If their opponents can fly, the aarakocra generally forgo the use of the net, although large groups sometimes use nets on flying creatures. Normally, aarakocra attack flying creatures with long spears, diving from above and allowing the momentum to carry the spear through the target. Such an attack doubles the damage if the aarakocra have been able to dive at least 50 feet. Only the very largest aarakocra can carry more than one of these spears, they can attack with both at once with no penalty, causing double damage on each strike. All diving attacks are made at +4 and should be treated as a charge attack. All other penalties and restrictions of charge attacks apply.</p><p>The effect of the aarakocra's nets depends on if the opponent is flying at the time it becomes entangled. Creatures on the ground that are hit by a net are entangled and unable to participate in any combat until they make a successful Strength check to get free of the net. Flying creatures hit by a net can no longer fly and immediately begin falling. If they cannot escape the net or use some magical means to arrest the fall, normal falling damage applies.</p><p>Unless victims are entangled in nets, aarakocra are cautious in ground combat. If the aarakocra outnumber their opponents they advance in a straight line and thrust with their spears. If outnumbered, or the opponents are particularly tough, the aarakocra withdraw. Victims entangled in nets are killed or incapacitated for use as food or ransom.</p><p>Athasian aarakocra are mindful of their physical limitations as well as their comparatively low psionic abilities. They do not normally initiate psionic combat. At the first sign of psionic powers from any of their victims, however, all aarakocra that have some ability will use whatever attack and defense modes they can in an attempt to destroy the threat. Large groups of is or more aarakocra may initiate psionic combat if their leaders feel they can win quickly and avoid physical combat.</p><p>In desperation, an aarakocra can attempt to bite an opponent in combat. Because of the unwieldiness of its beak, the aarakocra has a THAC0 of 18 if attacking with this appendage. Further, the birdman causes only 1d2 points of damage with the beak.</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Habitat/Society:</b> Athasian aarakocra live in tribes with 6-20 (2d8+4) members, depending on the prestige of the leader. The largest tribe ever recorded had 50 members. The tribal hunting territory depends on the size of the tribe, usually about 500 square miles for a tribe of 10 members. There are no rigid boundaries between tribes and border disputes are not uncommon.</p><p>Alignments of tribe members are similar to the alignment of the leader. A tribe that has a leader who is neutral good may have neutral good, chaotic good, lawful good, and true neutral members. A predominantly evil tribe does not recognize boundaries with other tribes and treats other tribes as inferior beings to be eliminated.</p><p>Athasian aarakocra aren't happy in enclosed spaces, but they they take refuge in a cave or building if necessary.</p><p>Nonevil tribes live in rocky aeries in the highest peaks they can find. Evil tribes are normally nomadic and use an aerie made by another tribe if they need to remain in an area for a long time, even if they have to evict the tribe that made the nest.</p><p>Aarakocra aren't friendly toward intruders in their territory, especially caravans. They try to extract a toll from the caravan for passage through the desert. Good-aligned tribes allow unhindered passage of caravans that pay a tribute. If someone refuses to pay the tribute, the aarakocra try to capture scouts or outriders from the party and hold them until an even larger tribute is paid. The payment may be either livestock or shiny objects. Aarakocra are smart enough not to be taken in by glass baubles instead of gems, although they cannot tell the difference between the more common gems and the rare ones.</p><p>Evil tribes ask for tribute and often attack a caravan whether it pays or not. Aarakocra always demand shiny objects such as stones. These tribes find humans and demihumans to be quite tasty and prefer them to other food.</p><p>Good-aligned tribes of aarakocra sometimes return a lost traveler to the edge of the desert after first removing any valuables the traveler may be carrying. On very rare occasions a tribe might return a lost group of travelers to the more frequently traveled parts of the desert, again after first taking any valuables as payment.</p><p>The oldest male is the leader of the tribal hunting party and has 4+4 Hit Dice. The oldest female is in charge of the tribal aerie and has 3+3 HD. In tribes that have more than 15 members, the next oldest aarakocra serves as shaman and has 3+3 HD; the shaman completes the triumvirate necessary for proper worship and the summoning of elementals. (Interestingly, no magic-using aarakocra has ever been recorded.) Tribes without a shaman cannot summon <a href=\"/appendix/element1\">air elementals</a>, which is an important part of aarakocra culture.</p><p>The shaman is the leader of the daily sun worship. Aarakocra worship the sun because it provides them with the thermals they need to soar in search of food. The shaman also leads the mystic rituals used to summon an air elemental. Summoning an air elemental is usually done only in preparation for the tribe's most sacred ceremony, the hunt. Small tribes must band together for this ceremony to allow the triumvirate to be formed.</p><p>The ceremony to summon an air elemental must be conducted at dawn and requires the oldest male and female to emit a highpitched keening whistle. The shaman conducts an intricate dance around them, simultaneously chanting an ancient summoning mantra.</p><p>The hunt is the final part of the initiation of adolescent aarakocra to adulthood and often takes the tribe far from their normal teritory. The target is always a <a href=\"/appendix/drakalsi\">silt drake</a>. The hunt is the only time the females leave the relative safety of the nest. Even an evil tribe will not interfere with a tribe on a hunt. An air elemental is often summoned to help find the drake, but never takes part in the actual combat. Although the adult members of the tribe take part in the initial phases of the combat, it is the initiates who deliver the final, killing blows to me drake. Scars from the hunt are considered a mark of pride among all aarakocra.</p><p>The females spend about eight months of the year incubating their eggs. Athasian aarakocra mate for life and a pair normally produces as many as 10 offspring. A female lays one egg a year. Constant incubation is not required because of the high daytime temperatures, so the females can maintain the nest and keep the tribe's treasure in order.</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Ecology:</b> Athasian aarakocra are high on the food chain and have no natural enemies other than <a href=\"/appendix/drakatha\">drakes</a>. Unless evil, aarakocra leave their own territory only to hunt the silt drake and return as soon as possible when the hunt is over. (Evil aarakocra attack others, as noted above.) Aarakocra eggs and hatchlings are sought after by wealthy land owners who wish to use the creatures as scouts and sentries. An egg can bring as much as 10 cp in Tyr's marketplace. Tribes that have had eggs or hatchlings stolen have long memories and sometimes take revenge against the thief at a later date. Captive aarakocra join any tribe they come in contact with.</p><p>Athasian aarakocra have a natural life span of 21-30 years.</p><p></p><br clear=\"all\" style=\"clear:both; height:0;\">\r\n","images":["<img src=\"grf/ds.gif\" width=\"150\" height=\"75\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Dark Sun\" title=\"Dark Sun\" align=\"right\">","<img src=\"img/aarakath.gif\" alt=\"Aarakocra (Athas)\" title=\"Aarakocra (Athas)\" border=\"0\" width=\"300\" height=\"360\" style=\"text-align:right;\" align=\"right\">","<img src=\"grf/add2_01.gif\" width=\"200\" height=\"56\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Advanced Dungeons & Dragons 2nd Edition\">"],"setting":"Dark Sun","statblock":{"Aarakocra (Athas)":{"Activity Cycle":"Day","Alignment":"Any","Armor Class":"7","Climate/Terrain":"Deep desert","Damage/Attack":"1d3/1d3 or by weapon","Diet":"Carnivore","Frequency":"Rare","Hit Dice":"2+2","Intelligence":"Average (8-10)","Magic Resistance":"Nil","Morale":"Steady (11)","Movement":"6, Fl 36 (C)","No. Appearing":"1d10","No. of Attacks":"2","Organization":"Tribal","Size":"M (20'+ wingspan)","Special Attacks":"Nil","Special Defenses":"Nil","THAC0":"17","Treasure":"Varies","XP Value":"65"}},"title":"Aarakocra (Athas)"},"sources":["2433"],"statblock_names":[],"title":"Aarakocra (Athas)","prev_key":"zygraat","next_key":"aarakocr","monster_path":"/appendix/aarakath"}}},"pageContext":{"monster_key":"shapeshi","monster_data":{"TSR":["2501"],"fullBody":"  <table cellspacing=\"0\" cellpadding=\"0\"><tr class=\"bk\"><th> </th><th class=\"cn\">Adaptor</th><th class=\"cn\">Metamorph</th><th class=\"cn\">Polymar</th><th class=\"cn\">Randara</th></tr><tr><th>Climate/Terrain:</th><td>Any</td><td>Temperate mountains and forests</td><td>Any</td><td>Any</td></tr><tr><th>Frequency:</th><td>Very rare</td><td>Rare</td><td>Rare</td><td>Very rare</td></tr><tr><th>Organization:</th><td>Cell</td><td>Clan</td><td>Pack</td><td>Solitary</td></tr><tr><th>Activity Cycle:</th><td>Any</td><td>Any</td><td>Any</td><td>Any</td></tr><tr><th>Diet:</th><td>Omnivore</td><td>Omnivore</td><td>Omnivore</td><td>Carnivore</td></tr><tr><th>Intelligence:</th><td><nobr>Genius (17-18)</nobr></td><td>High (13-14)</td><td>Low (5-7)</td><td>High (13-14)</td></tr><tr><th>Treasure:</th><td>V</td><td>W</td><td>B</td><td>F&times;3</td></tr><tr><th>Alignment:</th><td>Any</td><td>Chaotic neutral</td><td>Lawful neutral</td><td>Neutral evil</td></tr><tr><th>No. Appearing:</th><td>1d6</td><td>1d20</td><td>1d3</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><th>Armor Class:</th><td>9</td><td>5</td><td>9</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><th>Movement:</th><td>12</td><td>12</td><td>6</td><td>18</td></tr><tr><th>Hit Dice:</th><td>8</td><td>3+1</td><td>10</td><td>14</td></tr><tr><th>THAC0:</th><td>13</td><td>17</td><td>11</td><td>7</td></tr><tr><th>No. of Attacks:</th><td>2</td><td>1</td><td>3</td><td>As chosen form</td></tr><tr><th>Damage/Attack:</th><td>By weapon +4</td><td>By weapon</td><td>1d6 each (pseudopods)</td><td>As chosen form</td></tr><tr><th>Special Attacks:</th><td>See below</td><td>Nil</td><td>Nil</td><td>Spell use</td></tr><tr><th>Special Defenses:</th><td>See below</td><td>Shapechange</td><td>Nil</td><td>Hit only by +1 or better weapons</td></tr><tr><th>Magic Resistance:</th><td>Nil</td><td>Nil</td><td>Nil</td><td>Nil</td></tr><tr><th>Size:</th><td>M (5-6' tall)</td><td>M (6-7' tall)</td><td>S-L (3-10' across)</td><td>S-M (2-7' tall)</td></tr><tr><th>Morale:</th><td>Champion (15)</td><td>Average (10)</td><td>Steady (11)</td><td>Steady (11)</td></tr><tr><th>XP Value:</th><td>2,000</td><td>270<br>Leader: 650</td><td>2,000</td><td>8,000</td></tr></table><p class=\"f\">Numerous varieties of creatures are able to significantly alter their shapes; these range from <a href=\"/appendix/lycanthr\">lycanthropes</a> (such as <a href=\"/appendix/lycawewo\">werewolves</a> and <a href=\"/appendix/lycawejm\">werejaguars</a>) to amorphous creatures such as the <a href=\"/appendix/scamille\">scamille</a> and other oozes, jellies, and puddings.</p><p>Certain species also exist whose main feature is the ability to change shape. This ability is common across the species; it cannot be passed on to others; it is the species' primary method of attack and defense; and it is a conscious effort on the creature's part. Creatures meeting these criteria are collectively known as shapeshifters; in addition to the creatures listed here, the <a href=\"/appendix/doppelga\">doppelganger</a> and <a href=\"/appendix/mimic\">mimic</a> are shapeshifters.</p><h2>Adaptor</h2><p class=\"f\">Adaptors are an ancient, intelligent race found on all planes of existence. They are a withdrawn race, shunning contact with others and focusing instead on gathering information and exchangmg it among themselves.</p><p>In their natural state, adaptors are shiny, a gold, muscular, androgynous humanoids with blank oval faces. Adaptors can change into the form of any creature of human or demihuman size. Unlike doppelgangers, they cannot turn into duplicates of specific people.</p><p>Their superior intellect allows adaptors to know any language they are exposed to. Each is fluent in Common and xeveral other languages.</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Combat:</b> Adaptors are skilled at swordplay, attacking twice per round with a +4 bonus to attack and damage rolls when using swors. Adaptors favor long swords and rapiers.</p><p>The powers of the adaptors are formidable. For a limited time, they become immune to magical attacks once exposed. For instance, a fireball would cause full damage to an adaptor (or half if the saving throw is successful) the first time that adaptor is hit by a fireball, but for a short time, the adaptor is immune to all magical fire attacks. The adaption disappears in 1d10 turns if not triggered again. An adaptor may enjoy simultaneous immunities.</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Habitat/Society:</b> Adaptors are a mysterious, scholarly people. Each member has more accumulated knowledge than any sage. However, their philosophy demands that they not pass any great knowledge to other cultures.</p><p>Adaptors are natural observers, and their conversations with individuals or small groups are limited tp discussions of philosophy or asking questions about the people and land around them. If people are polite, an adaptor may answer a single question for them: background on an obscure magical item, perhaps, or information on an old, lost ruin.</p><p>The origin of the adaptors has long been lost. The few human and <a href=\"/appendix/elf\">elven</a> sages who know of their existence believe that adaptors themselves are searching for answers to their origin.</p><p>Adaptors gather in small groups devoted to a certain area of knowledge. These groups, called cells, usually  have little commerce with other cells of adaptors.</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Ecology:</b> Adaptors are nonintrusive creatures who do their best not to interfere with the natural state of the places they visit.</p><p>Adaptors may have odd and fantastic devices beyond the comprehension of those they encounter. Examples might include flame tubes, trance inducers, or energy neutralizers; the precise effects of these and other devices are left to the DM.</p><h2>Metamorph</h2><p class=\"f\">Metamorphs are an ancient species of shapeshifter distantly related to humans. They exist in harmony with nature and creatures close to nature, doing their part to preserve the natural balance.</p><p>A metamorph's natural form is that of a handsome human male or female, though its ears are slightly pointed and its eyes are pure white. Metamorphs speak fluent Common, and most (90%) speak the languages of elves and <a href=\"/appendix/halfling\">halflings</a>.</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Combat:</b> Normally, metamorphs are nonaggressive, choosing to shapeshift and withdraw rather than engage in a violent confrontation. When pressed, however, they fight seriously.</p><p>Metamorphs favor druidic weapons such as daggers, clubs, spears, slings, and sickles. They do not wear armor, as this becomes useless during shapeshifting.</p><p>If ten or more metamorphs are encountered, they will be accompanied by a leader with 5+2 Hit Dice. The presence of the leader boosts metamorph morale to 12, but a leader quite often leads others away from combat.</p><p>A metamorph makes saving throws as an 11th-level wizard.</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Habitat/Society:</b> A metamorph can shapeshift as often as 11 times per day, but it's limited to certain forms. This nonmagical shapeshifting power gives metamorphs all the abilities of the new form, including special attacks. Metamorphs cannot take giant-sized or monstrous forms. Forms available to metamorphs are amphibian, <a href=\"/appendix/bird\">bird</a>, <a href=\"/appendix/centiped\">centipede</a>, <a href=\"/appendix/crusgian\">crustacean</a>, <a href=\"/appendix/fish\">fish</a>, <a href=\"/appendix/insect\">insect</a>, <a href=\"/appendix/leech\">leech</a>, mammal, reptile, <a href=\"/appendix/spider\">spider</a>, and <a href=\"/appendix/worm\">worm</a>.</p><p>A metamorph can turn into a category of form only once per day. For example, a metamorph might transform into a <a href=\"/appendix/dog\">dog</a> one day and a <a href=\"/appendix/catsmall\">cat</a> the next day, but it can become only one mammal per day. Each form lasts up to an hour, but the metamorph can voluntarily change earlier.</p><p>Metamorphs reproduce like normal humans and live in clan strongholds away from normal human society, though they have good relations with elves, harflings, and druids. Each stronghold is led by a leader with 5+2 Hit Dice.</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Ecology:</b> Metamorphs act as self-appointed protectors of the environment within a five-mile radius of their stronghold.</p><h2>Polymar</h2><p class=\"f\">Polymars are modestly intelligent creatures that can change shape in order to lure prey. In their natural form, they are shapeless brown masses. The polymar is closely related to the mimic, and is apparently a more sociable version of the mimic.</p><p>Polvmars cannot communicate verbally, but seem to maintain a constant telepathic contact with other members of their pack. Some very rare packs have reportedly learned silent forms of communication, such as sign language or writing.</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Combat:</b> Polymars can look like any creature with 10 or fewer Hit Dice or any object smaller than 100 cubic feet. Polymars do not gain the special abilities of their new form. Polymars of the same pack have a psychic rapport with one another and cooperate very closely. The strongest pack member (the one with the most hit points) is the leader; when a polymar leader dies, the strongest living polymar becomes leader.</p><p>The form of the leader determines the form of each other pack member; if the leader imitates a piece of wooden furniture, so do the other pack members; if the leader takes the form of a humanoid, so do other pack members. Members of the same pack attempt to &ldquo;match&rdquo;, so that a pack imitating fumiture might resemble a couch, two chairs, a table, and a coat rack, all of the same apparent style.</p><p>A polymar's change is far from perfect; for example, polymars changed into humanoids tend to shamble about in a seemmgly random manner, and the wood grain of a polymar changed into a chair may not look quite right. Opponents notice something unusual on a roll of 1 on 1d6.</p><p>Regardless of form, a polymar that enters combat extrudes three pseudopods and attacks with them, causing 1d6 points of damage with each hit. Polymars coordinate their attacks, all striking at the same time; they all attack the same opponent if the leader decides it is appropriate.</p><p>A polymar pack feeds by engulfing dead plants or animals. An opponent slain by polymars will be completely dissolved in 2d4 hours, leaving only nonorganic material behind.</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Habitat/Society:</b> Polymars are very social creatures with others of the same pack. They cooperate completely, following the dictates of their leader.</p><p>Polymars reproduce by fission. All members of a pack reproduce at the same time after the pack has taken in sufficient nourishment. If the pack was small, all the polymars stay together; if the habitat cannot support increased numbers, half the polymars form their own pack and seek new territory.</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Ecology:</b> Alchemists and wizards covet polymar tissue for use in creating magical items and potions that involve shapeshifting or polymorphing.</p><h2>Randara</h2><p class=\"f\">Randaras are evil beings of legendary power. They delight in using their shapeshifting to trap innocent folks as food. Their true appearance is unknown. They most often appear as humans or humanoids, but can also take the shapes of small, cuddly animals. The form of the randara is always size S or M.</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Combat:</b> A randara's attack varies with its chosen form; for example, in human form, it uses weapons, but in the form of a dog, it bites. Damage is calculated for the creature imitated.</p><p>A randara can change its form in one round, but can take no other action in that round. It gains onIy the movement and normal attack abilities of its chosen form; the randara maintains its own natural Armor Class and gains none of the special abilities of its chosen form.</p><p>Randaras can cast <i>charm person</i> once per day and <i>ESP</i> at will, casting at the 11th level of ability. Randaras are immune to 1st through 3rd-level spells. They suffer only half damage from magical weapons. Nomnagical weapons do not harm them.</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Habitat/Society:</b> Randaras are very fond of human flesh. They often take forms designed to catch humans off-guard.</p><p>Usually, a randara seeks out a human settlement and looks for someone with modest power and respect. After stalking the victim for weeks, using ESP to learn about the individual, the randara murders its prey and impersonates the victim. Once established in a respectable position, the randara can use its new identity to lure more prey.</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Ecology:</b> Randaras are voracious hunters of human and demihuman flesh. They have no known natural enemies.</p><p></p><br clear=\"all\" style=\"clear:both; height:0;\">\r\n","images":["<img src=\"grf/ms.gif\" width=\"150\" height=\"75\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Mystara\" title=\"Mystara\" align=\"right\">","<img src=\"img/shapeshi.gif\" alt=\"Shapeshifter\" title=\"Shapeshifter\" border=\"0\" width=\"300\" height=\"360\" style=\"text-align:right;\" align=\"right\">","<img src=\"grf/add2_01.gif\" width=\"200\" height=\"56\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Advanced Dungeons & Dragons 2nd Edition\">"],"setting":"Mystara","statblock":{"Adaptor":{"Activity Cycle":"Any","Alignment":"Any","Armor Class":"9","Climate/Terrain":"Any","Damage/Attack":"By weapon +4","Diet":"Omnivore","Frequency":"Very rare","Hit Dice":"8","Intelligence":"<nobr>Genius (17-18)</nobr>","Magic Resistance":"Nil","Morale":"Champion (15)","Movement":"12","No. Appearing":"1d6","No. of Attacks":"2","Organization":"Cell","Size":"M (5-6' tall)","Special Attacks":"See below","Special Defenses":"See below","THAC0":"13","Treasure":"V","XP Value":"2,000"},"Metamorph":{"Activity Cycle":"Any","Alignment":"Chaotic neutral","Armor Class":"5","Climate/Terrain":"Temperate mountains and forests","Damage/Attack":"By weapon","Diet":"Omnivore","Frequency":"Rare","Hit Dice":"3+1","Intelligence":"High (13-14)","Magic Resistance":"Nil","Morale":"Average (10)","Movement":"12","No. Appearing":"1d20","No. of Attacks":"1","Organization":"Clan","Size":"M (6-7' tall)","Special Attacks":"Nil","Special Defenses":"Shapechange","THAC0":"17","Treasure":"W","XP Value":"270<br>Leader: 650"},"Polymar":{"Activity Cycle":"Any","Alignment":"Lawful neutral","Armor Class":"9","Climate/Terrain":"Any","Damage/Attack":"1d6 each (pseudopods)","Diet":"Omnivore","Frequency":"Rare","Hit Dice":"10","Intelligence":"Low (5-7)","Magic Resistance":"Nil","Morale":"Steady (11)","Movement":"6","No. Appearing":"1d3","No. of Attacks":"3","Organization":"Pack","Size":"S-L (3-10' across)","Special Attacks":"Nil","Special Defenses":"Nil","THAC0":"11","Treasure":"B","XP Value":"2,000"},"Randara":{"Activity Cycle":"Any","Alignment":"Neutral evil","Armor Class":"0","Climate/Terrain":"Any","Damage/Attack":"As chosen form","Diet":"Carnivore","Frequency":"Very rare","Hit Dice":"14","Intelligence":"High (13-14)","Magic Resistance":"Nil","Morale":"Steady (11)","Movement":"18","No. Appearing":"1","No. of Attacks":"As chosen form","Organization":"Solitary","Size":"S-M (2-7' tall)","Special Attacks":"Spell use","Special Defenses":"Hit only by +1 or better weapons","THAC0":"7","Treasure":"F&times;3","XP Value":"8,000"}},"title":"Shapeshifter"},"sources":["2501"],"statblock_names":[],"title":"Shapeshifter","prev_key":"shansao","next_key":"shargugh","monster_path":"/appendix/shapeshi"}},"staticQueryHashes":[],"slicesMap":{}}
