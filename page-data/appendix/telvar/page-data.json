While the powers listed above are the most common, some aarakocra have different or additional powers.</p><p class=\"f\">A race of intelligent, birdlike creatures living in the deepest deserts of Athas, the rare Athasian <a href=\"/appendix/aarakocr\">aarakocra</a> spends its time soaring on thermals in search of food.</p><p>The aarakocra is 7 to 8 feet tall with a wingspan of 20 feet or more. Because of its large wingspan, an aarakocra can carry as much as 75% of its own body weight and still fly easily. An aarakocra can fly a short distance carrying a burden equaling 125% of its own body weight. The average body weight of a full grown male is 100 pounds and a female is 85 pounds.</p><p>Each wing has a &ldquo;hand&rdquo; at its midpoint, consisting of three fingers and an opposable thumb. The fourth finger forms the rigid leading edge of the wing. In flight the hands cannot be used, but on the ground the aarakocra can use its hands almost as a human would. The aarakocra's body is protected by a thin bony plate on the chest, much like a solid rib cage. Talons on its legs can be used as claws and can be retracted to reveal a second set of hands, also with three fingers and an opposable thumb. Except for the chest plate, the entire skeleton is hollow and extremely fragile.</p><p>From a distance, the Athasian aarakocra resembles a huge <a href=\"/appendix/bird\">vulture</a>. Its black eyes, set in the front of the head, provide excellent vision over a long range. The plumage is generally black with a white collar for adult males and black or brown with a smaller white collar for females. Adolescents are a mixture of brown and black. The beak is large and covers most of the head. Plumage begins at the crown of the head and is darker near the head, except for the collar. Athasian aarakocra speak their own language and the languages of vultures and other large birds. Some speak the common tongue (5% to 10% chance depending on how deep in the wastelands a tribe lives).</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Combat:</b> Aarakocra can fight in the air or on the ground. They prefer aerial combat since their bones are too fragile to withstand a solid blow from a human-sized opponent. In combat against creatures on the ground, they prefer to fly over their victim and drop weighted nets. Some aarakocra use darts to harass ground-based opponents.</p><p>If their opponents can fly, the aarakocra generally forgo the use of the net, although large groups sometimes use nets on flying creatures. Normally, aarakocra attack flying creatures with long spears, diving from above and allowing the momentum to carry the spear through the target. Such an attack doubles the damage if the aarakocra have been able to dive at least 50 feet. Only the very largest aarakocra can carry more than one of these spears, they can attack with both at once with no penalty, causing double damage on each strike. All diving attacks are made at +4 and should be treated as a charge attack. All other penalties and restrictions of charge attacks apply.</p><p>The effect of the aarakocra's nets depends on if the opponent is flying at the time it becomes entangled. Creatures on the ground that are hit by a net are entangled and unable to participate in any combat until they make a successful Strength check to get free of the net. Flying creatures hit by a net can no longer fly and immediately begin falling. If they cannot escape the net or use some magical means to arrest the fall, normal falling damage applies.</p><p>Unless victims are entangled in nets, aarakocra are cautious in ground combat. If the aarakocra outnumber their opponents they advance in a straight line and thrust with their spears. If outnumbered, or the opponents are particularly tough, the aarakocra withdraw. Victims entangled in nets are killed or incapacitated for use as food or ransom.</p><p>Athasian aarakocra are mindful of their physical limitations as well as their comparatively low psionic abilities. They do not normally initiate psionic combat. At the first sign of psionic powers from any of their victims, however, all aarakocra that have some ability will use whatever attack and defense modes they can in an attempt to destroy the threat. Large groups of is or more aarakocra may initiate psionic combat if their leaders feel they can win quickly and avoid physical combat.</p><p>In desperation, an aarakocra can attempt to bite an opponent in combat. Because of the unwieldiness of its beak, the aarakocra has a THAC0 of 18 if attacking with this appendage. Further, the birdman causes only 1d2 points of damage with the beak.</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Habitat/Society:</b> Athasian aarakocra live in tribes with 6-20 (2d8+4) members, depending on the prestige of the leader. The largest tribe ever recorded had 50 members. The tribal hunting territory depends on the size of the tribe, usually about 500 square miles for a tribe of 10 members. There are no rigid boundaries between tribes and border disputes are not uncommon.</p><p>Alignments of tribe members are similar to the alignment of the leader. A tribe that has a leader who is neutral good may have neutral good, chaotic good, lawful good, and true neutral members. A predominantly evil tribe does not recognize boundaries with other tribes and treats other tribes as inferior beings to be eliminated.</p><p>Athasian aarakocra aren't happy in enclosed spaces, but they they take refuge in a cave or building if necessary.</p><p>Nonevil tribes live in rocky aeries in the highest peaks they can find. Evil tribes are normally nomadic and use an aerie made by another tribe if they need to remain in an area for a long time, even if they have to evict the tribe that made the nest.</p><p>Aarakocra aren't friendly toward intruders in their territory, especially caravans. They try to extract a toll from the caravan for passage through the desert. Good-aligned tribes allow unhindered passage of caravans that pay a tribute. If someone refuses to pay the tribute, the aarakocra try to capture scouts or outriders from the party and hold them until an even larger tribute is paid. The payment may be either livestock or shiny objects. Aarakocra are smart enough not to be taken in by glass baubles instead of gems, although they cannot tell the difference between the more common gems and the rare ones.</p><p>Evil tribes ask for tribute and often attack a caravan whether it pays or not. Aarakocra always demand shiny objects such as stones. These tribes find humans and demihumans to be quite tasty and prefer them to other food.</p><p>Good-aligned tribes of aarakocra sometimes return a lost traveler to the edge of the desert after first removing any valuables the traveler may be carrying. On very rare occasions a tribe might return a lost group of travelers to the more frequently traveled parts of the desert, again after first taking any valuables as payment.</p><p>The oldest male is the leader of the tribal hunting party and has 4+4 Hit Dice. The oldest female is in charge of the tribal aerie and has 3+3 HD. In tribes that have more than 15 members, the next oldest aarakocra serves as shaman and has 3+3 HD; the shaman completes the triumvirate necessary for proper worship and the summoning of elementals. (Interestingly, no magic-using aarakocra has ever been recorded.) Tribes without a shaman cannot summon <a href=\"/appendix/element1\">air elementals</a>, which is an important part of aarakocra culture.</p><p>The shaman is the leader of the daily sun worship. Aarakocra worship the sun because it provides them with the thermals they need to soar in search of food. The shaman also leads the mystic rituals used to summon an air elemental. Summoning an air elemental is usually done only in preparation for the tribe's most sacred ceremony, the hunt. Small tribes must band together for this ceremony to allow the triumvirate to be formed.</p><p>The ceremony to summon an air elemental must be conducted at dawn and requires the oldest male and female to emit a highpitched keening whistle. The shaman conducts an intricate dance around them, simultaneously chanting an ancient summoning mantra.</p><p>The hunt is the final part of the initiation of adolescent aarakocra to adulthood and often takes the tribe far from their normal teritory. The target is always a <a href=\"/appendix/drakalsi\">silt drake</a>. The hunt is the only time the females leave the relative safety of the nest. Even an evil tribe will not interfere with a tribe on a hunt. An air elemental is often summoned to help find the drake, but never takes part in the actual combat. Although the adult members of the tribe take part in the initial phases of the combat, it is the initiates who deliver the final, killing blows to me drake. Scars from the hunt are considered a mark of pride among all aarakocra.</p><p>The females spend about eight months of the year incubating their eggs. Athasian aarakocra mate for life and a pair normally produces as many as 10 offspring. A female lays one egg a year. Constant incubation is not required because of the high daytime temperatures, so the females can maintain the nest and keep the tribe's treasure in order.</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Ecology:</b> Athasian aarakocra are high on the food chain and have no natural enemies other than <a href=\"/appendix/drakatha\">drakes</a>. Unless evil, aarakocra leave their own territory only to hunt the silt drake and return as soon as possible when the hunt is over. (Evil aarakocra attack others, as noted above.) Aarakocra eggs and hatchlings are sought after by wealthy land owners who wish to use the creatures as scouts and sentries. An egg can bring as much as 10 cp in Tyr's marketplace. Tribes that have had eggs or hatchlings stolen have long memories and sometimes take revenge against the thief at a later date. Captive aarakocra join any tribe they come in contact with.</p><p>Athasian aarakocra have a natural life span of 21-30 years.</p><p></p><br clear=\"all\" style=\"clear:both; height:0;\">\r\n","images":["<img src=\"grf/ds.gif\" width=\"150\" height=\"75\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Dark Sun\" title=\"Dark Sun\" align=\"right\">","<img src=\"img/aarakath.gif\" alt=\"Aarakocra (Athas)\" title=\"Aarakocra (Athas)\" border=\"0\" width=\"300\" height=\"360\" style=\"text-align:right;\" align=\"right\">","<img src=\"grf/add2_01.gif\" width=\"200\" height=\"56\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Advanced Dungeons & Dragons 2nd Edition\">"],"setting":"Dark Sun","statblock":{"Aarakocra (Athas)":{"Activity Cycle":"Day","Alignment":"Any","Armor Class":"7","Climate/Terrain":"Deep desert","Damage/Attack":"1d3/1d3 or by weapon","Diet":"Carnivore","Frequency":"Rare","Hit Dice":"2+2","Intelligence":"Average (8-10)","Magic Resistance":"Nil","Morale":"Steady (11)","Movement":"6, Fl 36 (C)","No. Appearing":"1d10","No. of Attacks":"2","Organization":"Tribal","Size":"M (20'+ wingspan)","Special Attacks":"Nil","Special Defenses":"Nil","THAC0":"17","Treasure":"Varies","XP Value":"65"}},"title":"Aarakocra (Athas)"},"sources":["2433"],"statblock_names":[],"title":"Aarakocra (Athas)","prev_key":"zygraat","next_key":"aarakocr","monster_path":"/appendix/aarakath"}}},"pageContext":{"monster_key":"telvar","monster_data":{"TSR":["Dragon244"],"fullBody":"  <table cellspacing=\"0\" cellpadding=\"0\"><tr><th>Climate/Terrain:</th>  <td>Mountains</td></tr><tr><th>Frequency:</th>        <td>Rare</td></tr><tr><th>Organization:</th>     <td>Solitary</td></tr><tr><th>Activity Cycle:</th>   <td>Any</td></tr><tr><th>Diet:</th>             <td>Omnivore</td></tr><tr><th>Intelligence:</th>     <td>Medium</td></tr><tr><th>Treasure:</th>         <td>M,Q</td></tr><tr><th>Alignment:</th>        <td>Lawful Neutral</td></tr><tr><th>No. Appearing:</th>    <td>10-40</td></tr><tr><th>Armor Class:</th>      <td>6</td></tr><tr><th>Movement:</th>         <td>6, Fly 12 (B)</td></tr><tr><th>Hit Dice:</th>         <td>2</td></tr><tr><th>THAC0:</th>            <td>19</td></tr><tr><th>No. of Attacks:</th>   <td>2 or by weapon</td></tr><tr><th>Damage/Attack:</th>    <td>1-8 (+2)/1 -8 (+2) or by weapon</td></tr><tr><th>Special Attacks:</th>  <td>None</td></tr><tr><th>Special Defenses:</th> <td>None</td></tr><tr><th>Magic Resistance:</th> <td>Nil</td></tr><tr><th>Size:</th>             <td>L (8' tall)</td></tr><tr><th>Morale:</th>           <td>Fanatic (18)</td></tr><tr><th>XP Value:</th>         <td>65</td></tr></table><p class=\"f\">Telvar are aerial barbarians who live in mountainous regions far from civilized lands. They live in large clans and avoid contact with other races whenever possible.</p><p>Telvar are extremely tall, averaging almost 8 feet in height. They are quick and agile but not nearly as strong as humans or even <a href=\"/appendix/elf\">elves</a>. They have abnormally long fingers and toes, and they can use their feet to grip small objects. Telvar have large feathered wings that grow from their shoulders—pre-dominant colors are brown, gray, and white. Telvar have large, sharply pointed ears, as well as large eyes with two sets of eyelids. Telvar are usually heavily tattooed, the tattoos signifying important events such as the first hunt, a first kill, and family membership. Telvar dress in layers of loose-fitting clothing mostly the hides of various game animals.</p><p>Every male in each family is expected to be a proficient warrior and hunter; the weak do not usually survive childhood. Women are often trained as hunters and face the same rigorous training demands as the men. Women who aren't hunters either gather food or serve as family priests. All Telvar religious figures are women. While they cannot be the head of a family, they have great authority as spiritual and community advisors.</p><p>Telvar occasionally travel to cities for trade, but they feel uncomfortable when surrounded by multitudes of groundbased races. They are honorable in all their dealings and take extreme offense at being cheated or lied to. Telvar rarely develop strong relationships with other races, but they are staunch allies once they have committed themselves to an alliance. Of the four flying races detailed here, the Telvar are the least likely to be encountered as enemies of most bands of PCs.</p><p>Telvar have infravision to a range of 80 feet.</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Combat:</b> The Telvar are talented archers, able to fell their quarry from great distances while flying overhead. They are so skilled with the great bow that they gain a +2 bonus to damage for each successful bow attack. Telvar can never be specialized in melee weapons.</p><p>Telvar have very little magic to support combat operations. The priestly magic wielded by the females is used mainly for divination and healing, although female cleric/fighters are not unknown. Because of this lack of magic, Telvar consistently attack enemy spell-casters until they are neutralized. If they cannot defeat the spellcasters, they will withdraw until another opportunity presents itself.</p><p>If possible, and as long as their arrows hold out, Telvar attack ground-based enemies with missile fire. They do not engage in melee combat unless absolutely necessary or when an enemy has been severely weakened. Most Telvar wield long thin swords that inflict damage as short swords.</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Ecology:</b> The Telvar take great pains to live in harmony with the natural world. They realize that a balance must be maintained to ensure the long-term survival of each clan, so there is strict adherence to territorial hunting lands and no over-hunting within these lands. Travelers who pass through Telvar lands may do so without fear, provided they do not upset the balance that the Telvar have maintained for centuries.</p><p>Many races mistake the simple ways of the Telvar for a lack of intelligence. However, when necessary, the Telvar are capable of developing sophisticated military plans requiring complex co-ordination between clans. Those who have underestimated Telvar resolve have met with defeat, demonstrated by the fall of many humanoid bands that have tried to infringe upon Telvar territory.</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Habitat/Society:</b> Telvar are flying barbarians, building no cities and living off the land. They are fierce warriors, hardened by generations of subsistence living in harsh climates. The Telvar are nomads, traveling in large family groups that follow the yearly migrations of various herd animals.</p><p>The heads of every Telvar family meet every two years to settle disputes, discuss hunting strategies, and-on rare occasions-plan war against anyone infringing on their hunting grounds. Leadership in each Telvar family is determined by combat. Every three years, all warriors in each family are given the opportunity to challenge the current head of the family to ritual combat. Each battle lasts until one side concedes defeat. Defeated challengers often leave the family, either to start their own family or possibly to hire themselves out as mercenaries.</p><img src=\"/img/spc/telvar1.gif\" alt=\"Telvar\" title=\"Telvar\" style=\"float: right;\"><p class=\"f\"><b>Roleplaying Notes</b></p><p class=\"ni\">For some Telvar, the lure of the civilized world proves stronger than family ties. These young, idealistic individuals often leave the clan to find their fortune elsewhere. In addition, Telvar warriors who fail in their challenge for clan leadership almost always leave the family for a period of years, although many eventually return.</p><p>Telvar are comfortable with large groups and shared decision-making responsibilities. They can adapt their skill easily to the needs of a large adventuring group, but they prefer not to become involved in pitched battles. They often fulfill the role of scout and missile weapon specialist in a party. Telvar love to hunt, and they are masters of hit-andrun tactics and ambushes.</p><p>Telvar are used to hardship and the need to push themselves beyond their supposed physical limits. They expect similar sacrifices from their companions and have little patience for individuals who do not contribute to the common good. Their lack of tact in these situations can lead to tension with other members of an adventuring party.</p><p>Due to their difficulty in maneuvering in small spaces, Telvar have a great fear of being underground.</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Telvar Magical Items</b></p><p class=\"f\"><b>Hunter Cloaks</b></p><p class=\"ni\">The best hunter in each Telvar family wears a <i>hunter cloak</i>, a garment that is magically enhanced to make the wearer virtually invisible to creatures with animal intelligence. The wearer makes no sound when flying emits no smells, and absorbs any sound used by animals with echolocation. The <i>cloak</i> also gives the wearer <i>invisibility</i> to animals as long as the wearer is in the air; the <i>cloak</i> imparts no special benefits to wearers who are on the ground. The wearer can attack creatures with animal intelligence without losing the benefits of the <i>cloak</i>, but the <i>cloak</i> has no effect on any creatures with greater than animal intelligence.</p><p>XP Value: 1,500 GP Value: 3,000</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Cloak of the Telvar</b></p><p class=\"ni\">The Telvar excel at air-to-air combat. Their skills were put to the test against the <a href=\"/appendix/fainil\">Fainil</a>. To aid in these battles, the female clerics of each family created <i>concussion arrows</i>, specifically designed for use against the Fainil. The arrows have a +3 bonus to hit and damage, and a successful hit causes the arrow to explode, creating a shock wave that stuns anyone within 10 feet of the blast who fails a save vs. spells. The stun effect lasts for only one round.</p><p>XP Value: 300, GP Value: 650</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Shield of the Underdark</b></p><p class=\"ni\">The Fainil's most powerful item of defense against the Telvar is the <i>shield of the Underdark</i>. The <i>shield of the Underdark</i> is actually a normal appearing buckler and was often carried by an inconspicuous member of a Fainil combat unit. Once a day, by sacrificing all of his hit points but 1, the bearer of the shield can create a magical barrier in a 20' radius from his body that acts as <i>protection from normal missiles</i> spell and grants 15% magic resistance to everyone within the barrier. This protection lasts for 15 rounds or until the shield bearer is killed or rendered unconscious.</p><p>XP Value: 4,500, GP Value: 15,000</p>\n","images":["<img src=\"grf/dr.gif\" width=\"150\" height=\"75\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Dragon Magazine\" title=\"Dragon Magazine\" align=\"right\">","<img src=\"/img/spc/telvar1.gif\" alt=\"Telvar\" title=\"Telvar\" style=\"float: right;\">","<img src=\"grf/tsr_sm.png\" width=\"56\" height=\"59\" border=\"0\" alt=\"TSR\">"],"setting":"Dragon Magazine","statblock":{"Telvar":{"Activity Cycle":"Any","Alignment":"Lawful Neutral","Armor Class":"6","Climate/Terrain":"Mountains","Damage/Attack":"1-8 (+2)/1 -8 (+2) or by weapon","Diet":"Omnivore","Frequency":"Rare","Hit Dice":"2","Intelligence":"Medium","Magic Resistance":"Nil","Morale":"Fanatic (18)","Movement":"6, Fly 12 (B)","No. Appearing":"10-40","No. of Attacks":"2 or by weapon","Organization":"Solitary","Size":"L (8' tall)","Special Attacks":"None","Special Defenses":"None","THAC0":"19","Treasure":"M,Q","XP Value":"65"}},"title":"Telvar"},"sources":["Dragon244"],"statblock_names":[],"title":"Telvar","prev_key":"tchowb","next_key":"tembo","monster_path":"/appendix/telvar"}},"staticQueryHashes":[],"slicesMap":{}}
