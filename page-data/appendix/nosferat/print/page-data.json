While the powers listed above are the most common, some aarakocra have different or additional powers.</p><p class=\"f\">A race of intelligent, birdlike creatures living in the deepest deserts of Athas, the rare Athasian <a href=\"/appendix/aarakocr\">aarakocra</a> spends its time soaring on thermals in search of food.</p><p>The aarakocra is 7 to 8 feet tall with a wingspan of 20 feet or more. Because of its large wingspan, an aarakocra can carry as much as 75% of its own body weight and still fly easily. An aarakocra can fly a short distance carrying a burden equaling 125% of its own body weight. The average body weight of a full grown male is 100 pounds and a female is 85 pounds.</p><p>Each wing has a &ldquo;hand&rdquo; at its midpoint, consisting of three fingers and an opposable thumb. The fourth finger forms the rigid leading edge of the wing. In flight the hands cannot be used, but on the ground the aarakocra can use its hands almost as a human would. The aarakocra's body is protected by a thin bony plate on the chest, much like a solid rib cage. Talons on its legs can be used as claws and can be retracted to reveal a second set of hands, also with three fingers and an opposable thumb. Except for the chest plate, the entire skeleton is hollow and extremely fragile.</p><p>From a distance, the Athasian aarakocra resembles a huge <a href=\"/appendix/bird\">vulture</a>. Its black eyes, set in the front of the head, provide excellent vision over a long range. The plumage is generally black with a white collar for adult males and black or brown with a smaller white collar for females. Adolescents are a mixture of brown and black. The beak is large and covers most of the head. Plumage begins at the crown of the head and is darker near the head, except for the collar. Athasian aarakocra speak their own language and the languages of vultures and other large birds. Some speak the common tongue (5% to 10% chance depending on how deep in the wastelands a tribe lives).</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Combat:</b> Aarakocra can fight in the air or on the ground. They prefer aerial combat since their bones are too fragile to withstand a solid blow from a human-sized opponent. In combat against creatures on the ground, they prefer to fly over their victim and drop weighted nets. Some aarakocra use darts to harass ground-based opponents.</p><p>If their opponents can fly, the aarakocra generally forgo the use of the net, although large groups sometimes use nets on flying creatures. Normally, aarakocra attack flying creatures with long spears, diving from above and allowing the momentum to carry the spear through the target. Such an attack doubles the damage if the aarakocra have been able to dive at least 50 feet. Only the very largest aarakocra can carry more than one of these spears, they can attack with both at once with no penalty, causing double damage on each strike. All diving attacks are made at +4 and should be treated as a charge attack. All other penalties and restrictions of charge attacks apply.</p><p>The effect of the aarakocra's nets depends on if the opponent is flying at the time it becomes entangled. Creatures on the ground that are hit by a net are entangled and unable to participate in any combat until they make a successful Strength check to get free of the net. Flying creatures hit by a net can no longer fly and immediately begin falling. If they cannot escape the net or use some magical means to arrest the fall, normal falling damage applies.</p><p>Unless victims are entangled in nets, aarakocra are cautious in ground combat. If the aarakocra outnumber their opponents they advance in a straight line and thrust with their spears. If outnumbered, or the opponents are particularly tough, the aarakocra withdraw. Victims entangled in nets are killed or incapacitated for use as food or ransom.</p><p>Athasian aarakocra are mindful of their physical limitations as well as their comparatively low psionic abilities. They do not normally initiate psionic combat. At the first sign of psionic powers from any of their victims, however, all aarakocra that have some ability will use whatever attack and defense modes they can in an attempt to destroy the threat. Large groups of is or more aarakocra may initiate psionic combat if their leaders feel they can win quickly and avoid physical combat.</p><p>In desperation, an aarakocra can attempt to bite an opponent in combat. Because of the unwieldiness of its beak, the aarakocra has a THAC0 of 18 if attacking with this appendage. Further, the birdman causes only 1d2 points of damage with the beak.</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Habitat/Society:</b> Athasian aarakocra live in tribes with 6-20 (2d8+4) members, depending on the prestige of the leader. The largest tribe ever recorded had 50 members. The tribal hunting territory depends on the size of the tribe, usually about 500 square miles for a tribe of 10 members. There are no rigid boundaries between tribes and border disputes are not uncommon.</p><p>Alignments of tribe members are similar to the alignment of the leader. A tribe that has a leader who is neutral good may have neutral good, chaotic good, lawful good, and true neutral members. A predominantly evil tribe does not recognize boundaries with other tribes and treats other tribes as inferior beings to be eliminated.</p><p>Athasian aarakocra aren't happy in enclosed spaces, but they they take refuge in a cave or building if necessary.</p><p>Nonevil tribes live in rocky aeries in the highest peaks they can find. Evil tribes are normally nomadic and use an aerie made by another tribe if they need to remain in an area for a long time, even if they have to evict the tribe that made the nest.</p><p>Aarakocra aren't friendly toward intruders in their territory, especially caravans. They try to extract a toll from the caravan for passage through the desert. Good-aligned tribes allow unhindered passage of caravans that pay a tribute. If someone refuses to pay the tribute, the aarakocra try to capture scouts or outriders from the party and hold them until an even larger tribute is paid. The payment may be either livestock or shiny objects. Aarakocra are smart enough not to be taken in by glass baubles instead of gems, although they cannot tell the difference between the more common gems and the rare ones.</p><p>Evil tribes ask for tribute and often attack a caravan whether it pays or not. Aarakocra always demand shiny objects such as stones. These tribes find humans and demihumans to be quite tasty and prefer them to other food.</p><p>Good-aligned tribes of aarakocra sometimes return a lost traveler to the edge of the desert after first removing any valuables the traveler may be carrying. On very rare occasions a tribe might return a lost group of travelers to the more frequently traveled parts of the desert, again after first taking any valuables as payment.</p><p>The oldest male is the leader of the tribal hunting party and has 4+4 Hit Dice. The oldest female is in charge of the tribal aerie and has 3+3 HD. In tribes that have more than 15 members, the next oldest aarakocra serves as shaman and has 3+3 HD; the shaman completes the triumvirate necessary for proper worship and the summoning of elementals. (Interestingly, no magic-using aarakocra has ever been recorded.) Tribes without a shaman cannot summon <a href=\"/appendix/element1\">air elementals</a>, which is an important part of aarakocra culture.</p><p>The shaman is the leader of the daily sun worship. Aarakocra worship the sun because it provides them with the thermals they need to soar in search of food. The shaman also leads the mystic rituals used to summon an air elemental. Summoning an air elemental is usually done only in preparation for the tribe's most sacred ceremony, the hunt. Small tribes must band together for this ceremony to allow the triumvirate to be formed.</p><p>The ceremony to summon an air elemental must be conducted at dawn and requires the oldest male and female to emit a highpitched keening whistle. The shaman conducts an intricate dance around them, simultaneously chanting an ancient summoning mantra.</p><p>The hunt is the final part of the initiation of adolescent aarakocra to adulthood and often takes the tribe far from their normal teritory. The target is always a <a href=\"/appendix/drakalsi\">silt drake</a>. The hunt is the only time the females leave the relative safety of the nest. Even an evil tribe will not interfere with a tribe on a hunt. An air elemental is often summoned to help find the drake, but never takes part in the actual combat. Although the adult members of the tribe take part in the initial phases of the combat, it is the initiates who deliver the final, killing blows to me drake. Scars from the hunt are considered a mark of pride among all aarakocra.</p><p>The females spend about eight months of the year incubating their eggs. Athasian aarakocra mate for life and a pair normally produces as many as 10 offspring. A female lays one egg a year. Constant incubation is not required because of the high daytime temperatures, so the females can maintain the nest and keep the tribe's treasure in order.</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Ecology:</b> Athasian aarakocra are high on the food chain and have no natural enemies other than <a href=\"/appendix/drakatha\">drakes</a>. Unless evil, aarakocra leave their own territory only to hunt the silt drake and return as soon as possible when the hunt is over. (Evil aarakocra attack others, as noted above.) Aarakocra eggs and hatchlings are sought after by wealthy land owners who wish to use the creatures as scouts and sentries. An egg can bring as much as 10 cp in Tyr's marketplace. Tribes that have had eggs or hatchlings stolen have long memories and sometimes take revenge against the thief at a later date. Captive aarakocra join any tribe they come in contact with.</p><p>Athasian aarakocra have a natural life span of 21-30 years.</p>\n","images":["<img src=\"grf/ds.gif\" width=\"150\" height=\"75\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Dark Sun\" title=\"Dark Sun\" align=\"right\">","<img src=\"img/aarakath.gif\" alt=\"Aarakocra (Athas)\" title=\"Aarakocra (Athas)\" border=\"0\" width=\"300\" height=\"360\" style=\"text-align:right;\" align=\"right\">","<img src=\"grf/add2_01.gif\" width=\"200\" height=\"56\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Advanced Dungeons & Dragons 2nd Edition\">"],"setting":"Dark Sun","statblock":{"Aarakocra (Athas)":{"Activity Cycle":"Day","Alignment":"Any","Armor Class":"7","Climate/Terrain":"Deep desert","Damage/Attack":"1d3/1d3 or by weapon","Diet":"Carnivore","Frequency":"Rare","Hit Dice":"2+2","Intelligence":"Average (8-10)","Magic Resistance":"Nil","Morale":"Steady (11)","Movement":"6, Fl 36 (C)","No. Appearing":"1d10","No. of Attacks":"2","Organization":"Tribal","Size":"M (20'+ wingspan)","Special Attacks":"Nil","Special Defenses":"Nil","THAC0":"17","Treasure":"Varies","XP Value":"65"}},"title":"Aarakocra (Athas)"},"sources":["2433"],"statblock_names":[],"title":"Aarakocra (Athas)","prev_key":"zygraat","next_key":"aarakocr","monster_path":"/appendix/aarakath"}}},"pageContext":{"monster_key":"nosferat","monster_data":{"TSR":["2524"],"fullBody":"  <table cellspacing=\"0\" cellpadding=\"0\"><tr><th>Climate/Terrain:</th><td>Any</td></tr><tr><th>Frequency:</th><td>Very rare</td></tr><tr><th>Organization:</th><td>Solitary</td></tr><tr><th>Activity Cycle:</th><td>Any</td></tr><tr><th>Diet:</th><td>Blood</td></tr><tr><th>Intelligence:</th><td>Average to Genius (8-18)</td></tr><tr><th>Treasure:</th><td>F</td></tr><tr><th>Alignment:</th><td>Any, usually evil</td></tr><tr><th>No. Appearing:</th><td>1</td></tr><tr><th>Armor Class:</th><td>2</td></tr><tr><th>Movement:</th><td>12, Fl 18 (C)</td></tr><tr><th>Hit Dice:</th><td>7-9</td></tr><tr><th>THAC0:</th><td>As per equivalent class and level</td></tr><tr><th>No. of Attacks:</th><td>1 (bite)</td></tr><tr><th>Damage/Attack:</th><td>1d4 or by weapon</td></tr><tr><th>Special Attacks:</th><td>Charm, class abilities</td></tr><tr><th>Special Defenses:</th><td>Hit only by +1 or better magical weapons, regeneration, spell immunities</td></tr><tr><th>Magic Resistance:</th><td>Nil</td></tr><tr><th>Size:</th><td>M (5-7')</td></tr><tr><th>Morale:</th><td>Champion (15-16)</td></tr><tr><th>XP Value:</th><td>8,000 (minimum)</td></tr></table><p class=\"f\">A <a href=\"/appendix/vampnosf\">nosferatu</a> is a powerful and fearsome undead creature that strongly resembles a <a href=\"/appendix/vampire\">vampire</a>. Unlike its dark cousin, the nosferatu neither drains levels nor fears sunlight. However, most people fear nosferatu despite the fact that some nosferatu are not necessarily evil. These creatures are the victims of a dark fate, torn between pain, thirst, and disgust. Though nosferatu hunger for blood, they occasionally show compassion.</p><p>These undead creatures are not easily detectible. A nosferatu can easily mingle with mortals since its true nature is not obvious. It retains the abilities of its former class, as well as its new undead powers. It appears monstrous only when attacking. Like a vampire, however, a nosferatu has no shadow or reflection.</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Combat:</b> Its undead nature makes a nosferatu abnormally strong. At worst, a nosferatu has a Strength of 16. Its Strength otherwise remains what it was when the nosferatu was alive. Because nosferatu do not possess the ability to drain levels, they often rely on weapons or spells for combat.</p><p>A nosferatu can charm anyone foolish enough to stare into its eyes, as per the <i>charm person</i> spell. Victims may attempt a saving throw with a -2 penalty to avoid being charmed. Once it has entranced a victim in this manner, a nosferatu may make a suggestion, as per the spell. This often allows a nosferatu to get past guards without raising an alarm.</p><p>Weapons of less than +1 enchantment remain harmless to nosferatu, and if wounded, a nosferatu regenerates 1 hit point per round. If reduced to zero hit points, a nosferatu adopts a <i>gaseous form</i> and flees to its coffin. After eight hours in its coffin, the nosferatu regains its corporeal form. A nosferatu will die if it fails to return to its coffin within 12 turns of being defeated in combat.</p><p><i>Sleep</i>, <i>charm</i>, and <i>hold</i> spells, along with poisons and paralysis, do not affect nosferatu. Spells based upon cold or electricity cause only half damage.</p><p>A nosferatu can assume a <i>gaseous form</i> at will, during which time it is immune to physical attacks. In addition, nosferatu can <i>shape change</i> into a <a href=\"/appendix/bat\">large bat</a> at night or a <a href=\"/appendix/raven\">raven</a> during the day. All nosferatu have the ability to <i>spider climb</i>. Nosferatu can also <i>summon animals</i> - 1d100 <a href=\"/appendix/rat\">rats</a> or bats in a subterranean environment or 3d6 <a href=\"/appendix/wolf\">wolves</a> in the wilderness. Summoned animals arrive in 2d6 rounds.</p><p>A strong garlic smell will keep a nosferatu at bay. They are unaffected by the sight of clerical symbols, and only clerics of the opposite alignment or those specialized in hunting undead can turn nosferatu. These undead creatures suffer no ill effects from contact with clerical symbols or holy water.</p><p>Nosferatu generally avoid running water, because like their vampire kin, being immersed in running water for three consecutive rounds will destroy them. A wooden stake through its heart will accomplish the same result, although if the stake is removed, the nosferatu begins regenerating hit points. To completely destroy a staked nosferatu, it must be beheaded and have its mouth stuffed with dirt taken from ground dedicated to a good deity. Vampirism is an evil curse, and even the rare good-aligned nosferatu is vulnerable to the cleansing power of a good deity. In this case, the deity is not necessarily acting against the nosferatu, but against its evil curse.</p><p>Nosferatu cannot enter a personal residence without an invitation from a resident, but once invited, the nosferatu may come and go freely. Magical charm, disguise, or any other trickery used to obtain the invitation is still enough to allow nosferatu entrance to someone's home.</p><p>Human or humanoid victims may later become a nosferatu <i>only if the original undead wishes it</i>. If so, the victim rises from the dead three days after being drained of blood, unless its body was burned or totally destroyed. The victim remains under its killer's control. If the latter is killed, all the victims become self-willed.</p><p>Nosferatu always retain all the memories, abilities, skills, and restrictions of their former character class and level. A character of higher level than the maximum Hit Dice drops to the maximum. A character with fewer than the minimum Hit Dice increases to the minimum. For example, a 12th-level mage would return as a 9 Hit Die nosferatu with spells appropriate to a 9th-level mage; likewise, a 5th-level cleric would rise to a 7 Hit Die nosferatu with clerical spells equivalent to a 7th-level cleric. After this change has taken place, the nosferatu can continue to gain experience and levels. It is difficult for a nosferatu to change and grow, however, so it must earn three times the normal number of experience points in order to advance a level. Clerical spells no longer come from the original Immortal patron, unless the nosferatu has the same alignment.</p><p>Most ability scores remain the same, but Strength must be at least 16. A Constitution score is no longer required. Clerical and warrior nosferatu may wear armor, although it will not improve their Armor Class. Weapons used in combat must be appropriate to the former character class.</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Habitat/Society:</b> Nosferatu can dwell anywhere. They are found especially in the Eastern City-States like Slagovich, Zvornik, etc. Most often, a nosferatu will be a person of some importance in the region (a dashing nobleman, a reclusive wizard, the lord of a domain, etc.). These undead do not feel the morbid need of their vampire kin to dwell in cemeteries and other sinister places of death. Nosferatu seek the living whose blood they crave.</p><p>Being close to the world of the living, nosferatu feel at ease with unsuspecting mortals. In relative terms, nosferatu also tend to think less and act more compared to the vampire. While a vampire might spend a century brooding and scheming, a nosferatu will spend perhaps a decade. Nosferatu often need to change identities to hide the fact that they do not age or die. Clever disguises to modify the nosferatu's apparent age or impersonating its own offspring remain common tactics. If all else fails, disappearing for a decade also remains a valid option.</p><p>Nosferatu enjoy keeping company with others of their kind. An evil or neutral nosferatu and its lesser followers enjoy toying with the living even more. The rare nosferatu of good alignment, however, only occasionally interferes with the affairs of the living in order to preserve its existence or to save loved ones.</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Ecology:</b> Each nosferatu makes itself a secret place among the living. Evil nosferatu act more like their vampire kin, while the good-aligned nosferatu exist more as unfortunate victims. Good-aligned nosferatu create other undead only if the victim consents (i.e. a loved one), in which case, the victim's original alignment is preserved.</p><p>Evil nosferatu often twist a victim's alignment to reflect its own, but not always. An evil nosferatu could decide to preserve a victim's alignment as a form of torment. Good-aligned victims often seek to destroy themselves or their evil masters. The living always fear a nosferatu, regardless of its alignment.</p><p>All nosferatu crave the blood of the living. A nosferatu can go without blood for no more than a week before pain begins to twist its body. The pain causes all of its ability scores to drop 1 point per day after the first week of fasting, down to a minimum of 9. A nosferatu must drain at least 9 hit points worth of mortal blood per week to avoid this pain. To recover lost ability score points, a nosferatu must drink another 1d4 hit points worth of fresh blood. Nonhumanoid blood serves only to numb the pain for a day, but it cannot restore lessened ability scores.</p>\n","images":["<img src=\"grf/rs.gif\" width=\"150\" height=\"75\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Red Steel (Mystara)\" title=\"Red Steel (Mystara)\" align=\"right\">","<img src=\"img/nosferat.gif\" alt=\"Nosferatu\" title=\"Nosferatu\" border=\"0\" width=\"300\" height=\"360\" style=\"text-align:right;\" align=\"right\">","<img src=\"grf/add2_01.gif\" width=\"200\" height=\"56\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Advanced Dungeons & Dragons 2nd Edition\">"],"setting":"Red Steel (Mystara)","statblock":{"Nosferatu":{"Activity Cycle":"Any","Alignment":"Any, usually evil","Armor Class":"2","Climate/Terrain":"Any","Damage/Attack":"1d4 or by weapon","Diet":"Blood","Frequency":"Very rare","Hit Dice":"7-9","Intelligence":"Average to Genius (8-18)","Magic Resistance":"Nil","Morale":"Champion (15-16)","Movement":"12, Fl 18 (C)","No. Appearing":"1","No. of Attacks":"1 (bite)","Organization":"Solitary","Size":"M (5-7')","Special Attacks":"Charm, class abilities","Special Defenses":"Hit only by +1 or better magical weapons, regeneration, spell immunities","THAC0":"As per equivalent class and level","Treasure":"F","XP Value":"8,000 (minimum)"}},"title":"Nosferatu"},"sources":["2524"],"statblock_names":[],"title":"Nosferatu","prev_key":"noran","next_key":"nuckalav","monster_path":"/appendix/nosferat"}},"staticQueryHashes":[],"slicesMap":{}}
