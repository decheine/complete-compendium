While the powers listed above are the most common, some aarakocra have different or additional powers.</p><p class=\"f\">A race of intelligent, birdlike creatures living in the deepest deserts of Athas, the rare Athasian <a href=\"/appendix/aarakocr\">aarakocra</a> spends its time soaring on thermals in search of food.</p><p>The aarakocra is 7 to 8 feet tall with a wingspan of 20 feet or more. Because of its large wingspan, an aarakocra can carry as much as 75% of its own body weight and still fly easily. An aarakocra can fly a short distance carrying a burden equaling 125% of its own body weight. The average body weight of a full grown male is 100 pounds and a female is 85 pounds.</p><p>Each wing has a &ldquo;hand&rdquo; at its midpoint, consisting of three fingers and an opposable thumb. The fourth finger forms the rigid leading edge of the wing. In flight the hands cannot be used, but on the ground the aarakocra can use its hands almost as a human would. The aarakocra's body is protected by a thin bony plate on the chest, much like a solid rib cage. Talons on its legs can be used as claws and can be retracted to reveal a second set of hands, also with three fingers and an opposable thumb. Except for the chest plate, the entire skeleton is hollow and extremely fragile.</p><p>From a distance, the Athasian aarakocra resembles a huge <a href=\"/appendix/bird\">vulture</a>. Its black eyes, set in the front of the head, provide excellent vision over a long range. The plumage is generally black with a white collar for adult males and black or brown with a smaller white collar for females. Adolescents are a mixture of brown and black. The beak is large and covers most of the head. Plumage begins at the crown of the head and is darker near the head, except for the collar. Athasian aarakocra speak their own language and the languages of vultures and other large birds. Some speak the common tongue (5% to 10% chance depending on how deep in the wastelands a tribe lives).</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Combat:</b> Aarakocra can fight in the air or on the ground. They prefer aerial combat since their bones are too fragile to withstand a solid blow from a human-sized opponent. In combat against creatures on the ground, they prefer to fly over their victim and drop weighted nets. Some aarakocra use darts to harass ground-based opponents.</p><p>If their opponents can fly, the aarakocra generally forgo the use of the net, although large groups sometimes use nets on flying creatures. Normally, aarakocra attack flying creatures with long spears, diving from above and allowing the momentum to carry the spear through the target. Such an attack doubles the damage if the aarakocra have been able to dive at least 50 feet. Only the very largest aarakocra can carry more than one of these spears, they can attack with both at once with no penalty, causing double damage on each strike. All diving attacks are made at +4 and should be treated as a charge attack. All other penalties and restrictions of charge attacks apply.</p><p>The effect of the aarakocra's nets depends on if the opponent is flying at the time it becomes entangled. Creatures on the ground that are hit by a net are entangled and unable to participate in any combat until they make a successful Strength check to get free of the net. Flying creatures hit by a net can no longer fly and immediately begin falling. If they cannot escape the net or use some magical means to arrest the fall, normal falling damage applies.</p><p>Unless victims are entangled in nets, aarakocra are cautious in ground combat. If the aarakocra outnumber their opponents they advance in a straight line and thrust with their spears. If outnumbered, or the opponents are particularly tough, the aarakocra withdraw. Victims entangled in nets are killed or incapacitated for use as food or ransom.</p><p>Athasian aarakocra are mindful of their physical limitations as well as their comparatively low psionic abilities. They do not normally initiate psionic combat. At the first sign of psionic powers from any of their victims, however, all aarakocra that have some ability will use whatever attack and defense modes they can in an attempt to destroy the threat. Large groups of is or more aarakocra may initiate psionic combat if their leaders feel they can win quickly and avoid physical combat.</p><p>In desperation, an aarakocra can attempt to bite an opponent in combat. Because of the unwieldiness of its beak, the aarakocra has a THAC0 of 18 if attacking with this appendage. Further, the birdman causes only 1d2 points of damage with the beak.</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Habitat/Society:</b> Athasian aarakocra live in tribes with 6-20 (2d8+4) members, depending on the prestige of the leader. The largest tribe ever recorded had 50 members. The tribal hunting territory depends on the size of the tribe, usually about 500 square miles for a tribe of 10 members. There are no rigid boundaries between tribes and border disputes are not uncommon.</p><p>Alignments of tribe members are similar to the alignment of the leader. A tribe that has a leader who is neutral good may have neutral good, chaotic good, lawful good, and true neutral members. A predominantly evil tribe does not recognize boundaries with other tribes and treats other tribes as inferior beings to be eliminated.</p><p>Athasian aarakocra aren't happy in enclosed spaces, but they they take refuge in a cave or building if necessary.</p><p>Nonevil tribes live in rocky aeries in the highest peaks they can find. Evil tribes are normally nomadic and use an aerie made by another tribe if they need to remain in an area for a long time, even if they have to evict the tribe that made the nest.</p><p>Aarakocra aren't friendly toward intruders in their territory, especially caravans. They try to extract a toll from the caravan for passage through the desert. Good-aligned tribes allow unhindered passage of caravans that pay a tribute. If someone refuses to pay the tribute, the aarakocra try to capture scouts or outriders from the party and hold them until an even larger tribute is paid. The payment may be either livestock or shiny objects. Aarakocra are smart enough not to be taken in by glass baubles instead of gems, although they cannot tell the difference between the more common gems and the rare ones.</p><p>Evil tribes ask for tribute and often attack a caravan whether it pays or not. Aarakocra always demand shiny objects such as stones. These tribes find humans and demihumans to be quite tasty and prefer them to other food.</p><p>Good-aligned tribes of aarakocra sometimes return a lost traveler to the edge of the desert after first removing any valuables the traveler may be carrying. On very rare occasions a tribe might return a lost group of travelers to the more frequently traveled parts of the desert, again after first taking any valuables as payment.</p><p>The oldest male is the leader of the tribal hunting party and has 4+4 Hit Dice. The oldest female is in charge of the tribal aerie and has 3+3 HD. In tribes that have more than 15 members, the next oldest aarakocra serves as shaman and has 3+3 HD; the shaman completes the triumvirate necessary for proper worship and the summoning of elementals. (Interestingly, no magic-using aarakocra has ever been recorded.) Tribes without a shaman cannot summon <a href=\"/appendix/element1\">air elementals</a>, which is an important part of aarakocra culture.</p><p>The shaman is the leader of the daily sun worship. Aarakocra worship the sun because it provides them with the thermals they need to soar in search of food. The shaman also leads the mystic rituals used to summon an air elemental. Summoning an air elemental is usually done only in preparation for the tribe's most sacred ceremony, the hunt. Small tribes must band together for this ceremony to allow the triumvirate to be formed.</p><p>The ceremony to summon an air elemental must be conducted at dawn and requires the oldest male and female to emit a highpitched keening whistle. The shaman conducts an intricate dance around them, simultaneously chanting an ancient summoning mantra.</p><p>The hunt is the final part of the initiation of adolescent aarakocra to adulthood and often takes the tribe far from their normal teritory. The target is always a <a href=\"/appendix/drakalsi\">silt drake</a>. The hunt is the only time the females leave the relative safety of the nest. Even an evil tribe will not interfere with a tribe on a hunt. An air elemental is often summoned to help find the drake, but never takes part in the actual combat. Although the adult members of the tribe take part in the initial phases of the combat, it is the initiates who deliver the final, killing blows to me drake. Scars from the hunt are considered a mark of pride among all aarakocra.</p><p>The females spend about eight months of the year incubating their eggs. Athasian aarakocra mate for life and a pair normally produces as many as 10 offspring. A female lays one egg a year. Constant incubation is not required because of the high daytime temperatures, so the females can maintain the nest and keep the tribe's treasure in order.</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Ecology:</b> Athasian aarakocra are high on the food chain and have no natural enemies other than <a href=\"/appendix/drakatha\">drakes</a>. Unless evil, aarakocra leave their own territory only to hunt the silt drake and return as soon as possible when the hunt is over. (Evil aarakocra attack others, as noted above.) Aarakocra eggs and hatchlings are sought after by wealthy land owners who wish to use the creatures as scouts and sentries. An egg can bring as much as 10 cp in Tyr's marketplace. Tribes that have had eggs or hatchlings stolen have long memories and sometimes take revenge against the thief at a later date. Captive aarakocra join any tribe they come in contact with.</p><p>Athasian aarakocra have a natural life span of 21-30 years.</p><p></p><br clear=\"all\" style=\"clear:both; height:0;\">\r\n","images":["<img src=\"grf/ds.gif\" width=\"150\" height=\"75\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Dark Sun\" title=\"Dark Sun\" align=\"right\">","<img src=\"img/aarakath.gif\" alt=\"Aarakocra (Athas)\" title=\"Aarakocra (Athas)\" border=\"0\" width=\"300\" height=\"360\" style=\"text-align:right;\" align=\"right\">","<img src=\"grf/add2_01.gif\" width=\"200\" height=\"56\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Advanced Dungeons & Dragons 2nd Edition\">"],"setting":"Dark Sun","statblock":{"Aarakocra (Athas)":{"Activity Cycle":"Day","Alignment":"Any","Armor Class":"7","Climate/Terrain":"Deep desert","Damage/Attack":"1d3/1d3 or by weapon","Diet":"Carnivore","Frequency":"Rare","Hit Dice":"2+2","Intelligence":"Average (8-10)","Magic Resistance":"Nil","Morale":"Steady (11)","Movement":"6, Fl 36 (C)","No. Appearing":"1d10","No. of Attacks":"2","Organization":"Tribal","Size":"M (20'+ wingspan)","Special Attacks":"Nil","Special Defenses":"Nil","THAC0":"17","Treasure":"Varies","XP Value":"65"}},"title":"Aarakocra (Athas)"},"sources":["2433"],"statblock_names":[],"title":"Aarakocra (Athas)","prev_key":"zygraat","next_key":"aarakocr","monster_path":"/appendix/aarakath"}}},"pageContext":{"monster_key":"wildhunt","monster_data":{"TSR":["3140"],"fullBody":"  <table cellspacing=\"0\" cellpadding=\"0\"><tr><th>Climate/Terrain:</th>   <td>Forests, primarily in Shadow World</td></tr><tr><th>Frequency:</th>         <td>Very rare</td></tr><tr><th>Organization:</th>      <td>Unique</td></tr><tr><th>Activity Cycle:</th>    <td>Any</td></tr><tr><th>Diet:</th>              <td>Nil</td></tr><tr><th>Intelligence:</th>      <td>Low (6—mob mentality)</td></tr><tr><th>Treasure:</th>          <td>Nil</td></tr><tr><th>Alignment:</th>         <td>Chaotic neutral</td></tr><tr><th>No. Appearing:</th>     <td>1 (200 members)</td></tr><tr><th>Armor Class:</th>       <td>2</td></tr><tr><th>Movement:</th>          <td>24</td></tr><tr><th>Hit Dice:</th>          <td>50</td></tr><tr><th>THAC0:</th>             <td>5</td></tr><tr><th>No. of Attacks:</th>    <td>20</td></tr><tr><th>Damage/Attack:</th>     <td>1d6</td></tr><tr><th>Special Attacks:</th>   <td>Trample</td></tr><tr><th>Special Defenses:</th>  <td>Immune to illusions, slow, walls</td></tr><tr><th>Magic Resistance:</th>  <td>10%</td></tr><tr><th>Size:</th>              <td>Gargantuan (150' long)</td></tr><tr><th>Morale:</th>            <td>Fearless (19-20)</td></tr><tr><th>Bloodline:</th>         <td>None</td></tr><tr><th>Blood Abilities:</th>   <td>None</td></tr><tr><th>Perception/Seeming:</th><td>None/Greater</td></tr><tr><th>XP Value:</th>          <td>46,000</td></tr></table><p class=\"f\">The Wild Hunt is a fearsome party of <a href=\"/appendix/faerunse\">unseelie faeries</a>, undead, <a href=\"/appendix/shadstee\">shadow steeds</a>, and <a href=\"/appendix/cwnannwn\">cwn annwn</a> that stampedes through forests in a never-ending hunt for elves. Most often encountered in the Shadow World, the hunters have been known to enter Cerilia in their quest for prey. </p><p>The Wild Hunt is truly a spectacle to behold. Hunters of all shapes and sizes, sporting gruesome visages, charge forth on shadow steeds in fierce pursuit of fleeing elves. Baying cwn annwn add their howls to the clamor of shouting riders and thundering hooves as the din echoes for miles. The Hunt cuts a merciless swath through the forest, sparing not trees, nor plants, nor stray creatures in its path.</p><p>And after this violent fury has passed through the Shadow World terrain—not a trace of the Hunt remains. </p><p>An appearance of the Wild Hunt is always an event, even in its home terrain of the Shadow World.</p><p>Appearances in Cerilia occur rarely—perhaps once every five centuries—and are considered bad omens. In its aftermath, humans and dwarves probably won’t know what happened (their memories don’t extend far enough). But the elves will become very uneasy, particularly if the frequency of occurrences increases. Not only does the Wild Hunt present a danger to the safety of the Sidhe, but it signifies an intrusion of the Shadow World’s power into Cerilia.</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Combat:</b> This section discusses the Wild Hunt as a single entity. For information about the creatures that compose it, see their individual entries in this book and in the <i>MONSTROUS MANUAL</i> tome. </p><p>The Wild Hunt creates such a cacophony as it charges through the forest that it cannot gain surprise against potential prey. Even the deaf can sense it coming through reverberations in the ground.</p><p>The hunters use bows to attack from a distance. Though about 200 individual creatures make up the Hunt, only about 20 (10%) of them can get off a clear shot in a single round. Each arrow inflicts 1d6 points of damage. </p><p>Once the hunt closes in on its prey, either the cwn annwn rush in to attack (see separate entry) of the riders use their momentum to trample their quarry beneath the shadow steeds' hooves. Trample victims suffer 4d10 points of damage and must pass a system shock roll or die.</p><p>The Wild Hunt is immune to illusions and phantasms, slow and other movement-affecting spells, and walls. Only a <i>globe of invulnerability</i>, <i>limited wish</i>, or <i>wish</i> can divert the Hunt off its path </p><p>Though the sum of 200 hunters’ Hit Dice would exceed 50, that number has been listed as a guideline for “defeating” the Wild Hunt. Should characters manage to bring the Hunt down to 0 hit points, the Hunt disbands and regroups in 6d8 hours.</p><p>Though the Hunt ignores any creatures but elves, it does not divert its path to avoid them. Therefore, even non-elf player characters had better dive out of its way to avoid being trampled.</p><p>The Master of the Hunt, as an unseelie faerie, has the ability to cloak the Wild Hunt in the Seeming. He generally does not bother to do so, however, for it makes a fearsome enough spectacle all by itself. </p><p>The Hunt itself has no perception score, though individual members might. </p><p class=\"f\"><b>Habitat/Society:</b> The deep-rooted fear elves harbor toward the Shadow World derives in no small part from ancestral memories of the Wild Hunt. The how and why of its origin have been lost to time. Some believe it stems from the war between the <a href=\"/appendix/faerseel\">Seelie</a> and Unseelie Courts (refer to the “Faerie, Unseelie” entry), while others think it goes back further, to the time when the seelie and Sidhe people were one (see the “Faerie, Seelie” entry). Regardless, it has been pursuing and persecuting elves as long as anyone can remember</p><p>Comprising supernatural creatures who can go on living—or unliving—forever if not defeated in combat, the Wild Hunt is a tireless, ongoing pursuit. As members fall, others join the quest. The Hunt never stops. Sometimes it doesn’t even pause to slay its quarry, but simply tramples the elf to death in its endless drive. </p><p>The entourage is led by the Master of the Hunt, an evil faerie from the Unseelie Court. The Huntmaster is a tall, gaunt figure with large black eyes and a sinister, toothy grin. His harsh voice, often shouting out in pursuit, echoes loudly enough to be heard above the thundering hooves of the Hunt’s shadow steeds. </p><p>The Master of the Hunt is considered a favored noble of the Unseelie Court, though he never breaks from the Hunt to visit it. Should he ever fall in battle, the Dark Queen would appoint another of her courtiers to take his place.</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Ecology:</b> Like a speeding train, the Wild Hunt charges ahead rega rdless of what lies in its path—including portals. Occasionally, the Wild Hunt, in hot pursuit of its prey, lunges right through an open portal and storms into Cerilia. When this occurs, the Hunt leaves behind evidence of its passing (unlike in the Shadow World) </p><p>Huge swaths of trees are felled, crops and fields are trampled. The region is left looking like a tornado has blown through it.</p><p>The Wild Hunt is believed to have inspired the <i>ghaellie Sidhe</i>. Searching for a way to drive humans from their land, the elves created their own Hunt. </p>\n","images":["<img src=\"grf/br.gif\" width=\"150\" height=\"75\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Birthright\" title=\"Birthright\" align=\"right\">","<img src=\"grf/tsr_sm.png\" width=\"56\" height=\"59\" border=\"0\" alt=\"TSR\">"],"setting":"Birthright","statblock":{"Wild Hunt":{"Activity Cycle":"Any","Alignment":"Chaotic neutral","Armor Class":"2","Blood Abilities":"None","Bloodline":"None","Climate/Terrain":"Forests, primarily in Shadow World","Damage/Attack":"1d6","Diet":"Nil","Frequency":"Very rare","Hit Dice":"50","Intelligence":"Low (6—mob mentality)","Magic Resistance":"10%","Morale":"Fearless (19-20)","Movement":"24","No. Appearing":"1 (200 members)","No. of Attacks":"20","Organization":"Unique","Perception/Seeming":"None/Greater","Size":"Gargantuan (150' long)","Special Attacks":"Trample","Special Defenses":"Immune to illusions, slow, walls","THAC0":"5","Treasure":"Nil","XP Value":"46,000"}},"title":"Wild Hunt"},"sources":["3140"],"statblock_names":[],"title":"Wild Hunt","prev_key":"wight","next_key":"willblee","monster_path":"/appendix/wildhunt"}},"staticQueryHashes":[],"slicesMap":{}}
