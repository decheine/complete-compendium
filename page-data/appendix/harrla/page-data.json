While the powers listed above are the most common, some aarakocra have different or additional powers.</p><p class=\"f\">A race of intelligent, birdlike creatures living in the deepest deserts of Athas, the rare Athasian <a href=\"/appendix/aarakocr\">aarakocra</a> spends its time soaring on thermals in search of food.</p><p>The aarakocra is 7 to 8 feet tall with a wingspan of 20 feet or more. Because of its large wingspan, an aarakocra can carry as much as 75% of its own body weight and still fly easily. An aarakocra can fly a short distance carrying a burden equaling 125% of its own body weight. The average body weight of a full grown male is 100 pounds and a female is 85 pounds.</p><p>Each wing has a &ldquo;hand&rdquo; at its midpoint, consisting of three fingers and an opposable thumb. The fourth finger forms the rigid leading edge of the wing. In flight the hands cannot be used, but on the ground the aarakocra can use its hands almost as a human would. The aarakocra's body is protected by a thin bony plate on the chest, much like a solid rib cage. Talons on its legs can be used as claws and can be retracted to reveal a second set of hands, also with three fingers and an opposable thumb. Except for the chest plate, the entire skeleton is hollow and extremely fragile.</p><p>From a distance, the Athasian aarakocra resembles a huge <a href=\"/appendix/bird\">vulture</a>. Its black eyes, set in the front of the head, provide excellent vision over a long range. The plumage is generally black with a white collar for adult males and black or brown with a smaller white collar for females. Adolescents are a mixture of brown and black. The beak is large and covers most of the head. Plumage begins at the crown of the head and is darker near the head, except for the collar. Athasian aarakocra speak their own language and the languages of vultures and other large birds. Some speak the common tongue (5% to 10% chance depending on how deep in the wastelands a tribe lives).</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Combat:</b> Aarakocra can fight in the air or on the ground. They prefer aerial combat since their bones are too fragile to withstand a solid blow from a human-sized opponent. In combat against creatures on the ground, they prefer to fly over their victim and drop weighted nets. Some aarakocra use darts to harass ground-based opponents.</p><p>If their opponents can fly, the aarakocra generally forgo the use of the net, although large groups sometimes use nets on flying creatures. Normally, aarakocra attack flying creatures with long spears, diving from above and allowing the momentum to carry the spear through the target. Such an attack doubles the damage if the aarakocra have been able to dive at least 50 feet. Only the very largest aarakocra can carry more than one of these spears, they can attack with both at once with no penalty, causing double damage on each strike. All diving attacks are made at +4 and should be treated as a charge attack. All other penalties and restrictions of charge attacks apply.</p><p>The effect of the aarakocra's nets depends on if the opponent is flying at the time it becomes entangled. Creatures on the ground that are hit by a net are entangled and unable to participate in any combat until they make a successful Strength check to get free of the net. Flying creatures hit by a net can no longer fly and immediately begin falling. If they cannot escape the net or use some magical means to arrest the fall, normal falling damage applies.</p><p>Unless victims are entangled in nets, aarakocra are cautious in ground combat. If the aarakocra outnumber their opponents they advance in a straight line and thrust with their spears. If outnumbered, or the opponents are particularly tough, the aarakocra withdraw. Victims entangled in nets are killed or incapacitated for use as food or ransom.</p><p>Athasian aarakocra are mindful of their physical limitations as well as their comparatively low psionic abilities. They do not normally initiate psionic combat. At the first sign of psionic powers from any of their victims, however, all aarakocra that have some ability will use whatever attack and defense modes they can in an attempt to destroy the threat. Large groups of is or more aarakocra may initiate psionic combat if their leaders feel they can win quickly and avoid physical combat.</p><p>In desperation, an aarakocra can attempt to bite an opponent in combat. Because of the unwieldiness of its beak, the aarakocra has a THAC0 of 18 if attacking with this appendage. Further, the birdman causes only 1d2 points of damage with the beak.</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Habitat/Society:</b> Athasian aarakocra live in tribes with 6-20 (2d8+4) members, depending on the prestige of the leader. The largest tribe ever recorded had 50 members. The tribal hunting territory depends on the size of the tribe, usually about 500 square miles for a tribe of 10 members. There are no rigid boundaries between tribes and border disputes are not uncommon.</p><p>Alignments of tribe members are similar to the alignment of the leader. A tribe that has a leader who is neutral good may have neutral good, chaotic good, lawful good, and true neutral members. A predominantly evil tribe does not recognize boundaries with other tribes and treats other tribes as inferior beings to be eliminated.</p><p>Athasian aarakocra aren't happy in enclosed spaces, but they they take refuge in a cave or building if necessary.</p><p>Nonevil tribes live in rocky aeries in the highest peaks they can find. Evil tribes are normally nomadic and use an aerie made by another tribe if they need to remain in an area for a long time, even if they have to evict the tribe that made the nest.</p><p>Aarakocra aren't friendly toward intruders in their territory, especially caravans. They try to extract a toll from the caravan for passage through the desert. Good-aligned tribes allow unhindered passage of caravans that pay a tribute. If someone refuses to pay the tribute, the aarakocra try to capture scouts or outriders from the party and hold them until an even larger tribute is paid. The payment may be either livestock or shiny objects. Aarakocra are smart enough not to be taken in by glass baubles instead of gems, although they cannot tell the difference between the more common gems and the rare ones.</p><p>Evil tribes ask for tribute and often attack a caravan whether it pays or not. Aarakocra always demand shiny objects such as stones. These tribes find humans and demihumans to be quite tasty and prefer them to other food.</p><p>Good-aligned tribes of aarakocra sometimes return a lost traveler to the edge of the desert after first removing any valuables the traveler may be carrying. On very rare occasions a tribe might return a lost group of travelers to the more frequently traveled parts of the desert, again after first taking any valuables as payment.</p><p>The oldest male is the leader of the tribal hunting party and has 4+4 Hit Dice. The oldest female is in charge of the tribal aerie and has 3+3 HD. In tribes that have more than 15 members, the next oldest aarakocra serves as shaman and has 3+3 HD; the shaman completes the triumvirate necessary for proper worship and the summoning of elementals. (Interestingly, no magic-using aarakocra has ever been recorded.) Tribes without a shaman cannot summon <a href=\"/appendix/element1\">air elementals</a>, which is an important part of aarakocra culture.</p><p>The shaman is the leader of the daily sun worship. Aarakocra worship the sun because it provides them with the thermals they need to soar in search of food. The shaman also leads the mystic rituals used to summon an air elemental. Summoning an air elemental is usually done only in preparation for the tribe's most sacred ceremony, the hunt. Small tribes must band together for this ceremony to allow the triumvirate to be formed.</p><p>The ceremony to summon an air elemental must be conducted at dawn and requires the oldest male and female to emit a highpitched keening whistle. The shaman conducts an intricate dance around them, simultaneously chanting an ancient summoning mantra.</p><p>The hunt is the final part of the initiation of adolescent aarakocra to adulthood and often takes the tribe far from their normal teritory. The target is always a <a href=\"/appendix/drakalsi\">silt drake</a>. The hunt is the only time the females leave the relative safety of the nest. Even an evil tribe will not interfere with a tribe on a hunt. An air elemental is often summoned to help find the drake, but never takes part in the actual combat. Although the adult members of the tribe take part in the initial phases of the combat, it is the initiates who deliver the final, killing blows to me drake. Scars from the hunt are considered a mark of pride among all aarakocra.</p><p>The females spend about eight months of the year incubating their eggs. Athasian aarakocra mate for life and a pair normally produces as many as 10 offspring. A female lays one egg a year. Constant incubation is not required because of the high daytime temperatures, so the females can maintain the nest and keep the tribe's treasure in order.</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Ecology:</b> Athasian aarakocra are high on the food chain and have no natural enemies other than <a href=\"/appendix/drakatha\">drakes</a>. Unless evil, aarakocra leave their own territory only to hunt the silt drake and return as soon as possible when the hunt is over. (Evil aarakocra attack others, as noted above.) Aarakocra eggs and hatchlings are sought after by wealthy land owners who wish to use the creatures as scouts and sentries. An egg can bring as much as 10 cp in Tyr's marketplace. Tribes that have had eggs or hatchlings stolen have long memories and sometimes take revenge against the thief at a later date. Captive aarakocra join any tribe they come in contact with.</p><p>Athasian aarakocra have a natural life span of 21-30 years.</p>\n","images":["<img src=\"grf/ds.gif\" width=\"150\" height=\"75\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Dark Sun\" title=\"Dark Sun\" align=\"right\">","<img src=\"img/aarakath.gif\" alt=\"Aarakocra (Athas)\" title=\"Aarakocra (Athas)\" border=\"0\" width=\"300\" height=\"360\" style=\"text-align:right;\" align=\"right\">","<img src=\"grf/add2_01.gif\" width=\"200\" height=\"56\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Advanced Dungeons & Dragons 2nd Edition\">"],"setting":"Dark Sun","statblock":{"Aarakocra (Athas)":{"Activity Cycle":"Day","Alignment":"Any","Armor Class":"7","Climate/Terrain":"Deep desert","Damage/Attack":"1d3/1d3 or by weapon","Diet":"Carnivore","Frequency":"Rare","Hit Dice":"2+2","Intelligence":"Average (8-10)","Magic Resistance":"Nil","Morale":"Steady (11)","Movement":"6, Fl 36 (C)","No. Appearing":"1d10","No. of Attacks":"2","Organization":"Tribal","Size":"M (20'+ wingspan)","Special Attacks":"Nil","Special Defenses":"Nil","THAC0":"17","Treasure":"Varies","XP Value":"65"}},"title":"Aarakocra (Athas)"},"sources":["2433"],"statblock_names":[],"title":"Aarakocra (Athas)","prev_key":"zygraat","next_key":"aarakocr","monster_path":"/appendix/aarakath"}}},"pageContext":{"monster_key":"harrla","monster_data":{"TSR":["2125"],"fullBody":"  <table cellspacing=\"0\" cellpadding=\"0\"><tr><th>Climate/Terrain:</th><td>Any urban area</td></tr><tr><th>Frequency:</th><td>Very rare</td></tr><tr><th>Organization:</th><td>Solitary</td></tr><tr><th>Activity Cycle:</th><td>Night</td></tr><tr><th>Diet:</th><td>Life energy</td></tr><tr><th>Intelligence:</th><td>Very (11-12)</td></tr><tr><th>Treasure:</th><td>Nil</td></tr><tr><th>Alignment:</th><td>Chaotic evil</td></tr><tr><th>No. Appearing:</th><td>1</td></tr><tr><th>Armor Class:</th><td>0</td></tr><tr><th>Movement:</th><td>Fl 15 (A)</td></tr><tr><th>Hit Dice:</th><td>4+3</td></tr><tr><th>THAC0:</th><td>15</td></tr><tr><th>No. of Attacks:</th><td>0</td></tr><tr><th>Damage/Attack:</th><td>Nil</td></tr><tr><th>Special Attacks:</th><td>Emotion control</td></tr><tr><th>Special Defenses:</th><td>See below</td></tr><tr><th>Magic Resistance:</th><td>Nil</td></tr><tr><th>Size:</th><td>M (6' tall)</td></tr><tr><th>Morale:</th><td>Fearless (20)</td></tr><tr><th>XP Value:</th><td>5,000</td></tr></table><p class=\"f\">Every culture has reports of unusual behavior by otherwise normal people. Perhaps a wife who has been true and faithful for many years suddenly seeks passion in the arms of a stranger. Maybe a man who has been good and kind his entire life suddenly lashes out and kills several of his best friends. Sometimes this sudden change is the result of natural psychological stress or madness, but often it is the work of the dreaded harrla.</p><p>The harrla is naturally and permanently invisible. Those capable of sensing invisible objects see it as a humanoid figure, the height of a man. Its edges shimmer and fluctuate, making it impossible to determine if the form is a man or a woman.</p><p>The harrla has no known language, and seems unable to communicate. Some scholars say that a harrla can communicate with others of its kind, but there is certainly no proof of this. As they are almost never encountered in pairs or groups, however, language is all but unnecessary for them.</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Combat:</b> The harrla does not enter physical combat the way that many creatures do. It has no capacity to inflict physical damage and takes whatever steps it must to avoid placing itself in danger of physical or mystical assault. Of course, it is aware that most material weapons and spells cannot harm it, so its judgment is affected by these considerations.</p><p>The main &ldquo;attack&rdquo; mode of the harrla is its ability to infuse a living creature with an overpowering emotion. Each harrla is able to project only a single emotion. Although there are, in theory, as many types of harrla as there are emotional states, some common examples include hate, passion, and fear.</p><p><i>Hate:</i> This type of harrla is capable of inducing hate in its victims that causes them to be overwhelmed with the desire to kill and destroy. While they do not simply attack anyone that they see, the slightest provocation results in a violent outburst. Thus, someone at the breakfast table might go into a killing frenzy upon finding that his meal was improperly prepared.</p><p><i>Passion:</i> Those infused with passion find themselves unable to control their romantic desires. They fall into the arms of the nearest person of the appropriate sex and behave in a most wanton manner. The effects of this infusion are similar to those of the <i>philter of love</i>, only more intense and of shorter duration.</p><p><i>Fear:</i> Persons overcome with fear flee from anything that presents itself to them in a frightening manner. Because the victims lose control of basic common sense, however, even persons reaching out to or walking toward the characters will take on menacing overtones.</p><p>The harrla is naturally drawn to those who are struggling to keep the emotion that it generates in check. Once it finds such persons, it begins to stimulate the emotional centers of the victims' subconscious minds. Within a few seconds, the victims become consumed by the false emotions of the harrla and act purely according to their new emotional state. While in this condition, the characters are under the control of the Dungeon Master, just as if they were NPCs.</p><p>The victims have no memory of what they have done while under the influence of the harrla and are often shocked to learn what has transpired during the missing minutes of their life. The harrla's influence remains for 30 minutes, minus 1 minute per point of the victim's Wisdom score. A saving throw vs. spells is permitted to avoid the influences of this creature, with success indicating that the victims are safe for 24 hours. This save is permitted only when the harrla first attempts to dominate an individual.</p><p>Those under the influence of the harrla can be freed by a magical spell that counters the emotional effect of the creature. Thus, someone who was under the influence of a harrla that projected mindless happiness could be released by the casting of an <i>emotion</i> spell that induced sadness.</p><p>It is also possible to break the power of the creature through forceful persuasion and Charisma. In order for characters to drive out the influence of the harrla they must be a true and trusted friend of the dominated character. If this is the case, the individuals must try to convince the victims that things are not as they perceive them. The chance of this working is 1% per Charisma point of the person trying to break the enchantment.</p><p>Persons under the emotional influence of a harrla lose 1 point of Charisma. This loss is permanent, remaining even after the victims throw off the effects of the harrla's emotion controlling power. When the victims. Charisma scores are reduced to 0, the victims lose all vitality and will to live, dying in 1-6 rounds. Only restoring lost Charisma points prevents death.</p><p>When a harrla is dominating a specific person, it cannot travel more than 75 feet away from him. The creature retains its natural ability to fly, however, and often drifts above him as he moves through crowds and the like.</p><p>As an example of the harrla's dark and evil power, consider the following situation. A cleric of lawful good alignment is walking along the street when he is confronted by several members of another faith. They exchange cordial greetings and some brief conversation. During the chat, the priest is offended by several of the comments made about his church. This causes him to subconsciously resent the others, but he does not wish to make a public scene and says nothing about the insults. A passing harrla that induces rage senses his buried anger and begins to manipulate the priest's psyche. Fifteen minutes later, the priest suddenly finds that he has slain half a dozen innocent men and is now a wanted criminal. The harrla has done its evil work well.</p><p>The harrla is composed of nothing but emotional energy and is immune to damage from any manner of non-magical weapon. Further, even magical weapons inflict only half their normal damage to the creature. Of course, the weapon gains the traditional bonuses associated with an invisible opponent (-2 surprise modifier, etc.).</p><p>Magical spells have a reduced effectiveness against the harrla, because of its unusual form. It is immune to all spells that inflict damage based on heat or fire, cold or ice, electricity or lightning, and those that affect a biological function, such as <i>sleep</i> or <i>cause light wounds</i>. Emotion controlling spells, such as <i>charm</i>, have been known to affect the creature, although it gains a +4 bonus to any saving throw it makes against them.</p><p>The harrla's energy nature gives it the ability to pass through any solid objects with ease. The only known barriers through which a harrla cannot pass are those of a magical nature, such as a <i>protection from evil</i> or similar spell.</p><p>When a harrla passes through an individual, it momentarily infuses the individual with the emotion of the creature. The harrla does not actually feed upon the character's emotional energy, and the victim is entitled to a saving throw vs. spells with a +2 bonus to avoid its influence. If the save fails, the victim is consumed by the emotion for 1d4 rounds. Because the creature is not actually feeding when it does this, the harrla does not drain someone of a Charisma point.</p><p>While the harrla is indeed a dangerous adversary, it is not without weaknesses. Experience has shown that each and every harrla has a special weakness related to the emotion that it projects. For example, one scholar, a noted authority on paranormal creatures, reports that he once encountered a harrla that induced an utterly consuming depression in its victims. This despair was so great as to be life threatening. Upon researching the local rumors, he found ancient writings that convinced him that the tears of one of its victims would be damaging to the harrla. Sure enough, when the sage sprinkled such tears upon the harrla, it let out an audible shriek of agony and fled the area, never to be &ldquo;seen&rdquo; again.</p><p>In addition to its special weakness, a harrla can be driven away for 10-100 days with a <i>dismissal</i> spell or utterly destroyed with a <i>banishment</i> spell. The harrla is also vulnerable to spells such as <i>trap the soul</i>. An <i>emotion control</i> spell cast upon the creature stuns it for 1d4 rounds, during which time it can attempt no actions at all and is utterly helpless.</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Habitat/Society:</b> The harrla is a strange and solitary creature. It has no social organization, but drifts like a hunting <a href=\"/appendix/shark\">shark</a> through the sea of humanity in search of a victim. When it finds a target, it strikes.</p><p>Harrla seem to develop some sort of psychological attachment to their victims. They become fascinated with the character's ability to &ldquo;feel&rdquo; and the intensity of its emotions. They tend to linger near past victims, waiting for a chance to dominate them again. It is not uncommon for an individual to fall into repeated periods of domination over the course of several days until, exhausted by the feedings of the harrla and drained of all Charisma, he dies.</p><p>On the average, a harrla drives its victims into a superemotional state and feeds upon them once or twice a week. A harrla returns to a victim in its need to feed upon emotional energy every 2d4 days.</p><p>The harrla seldom remains in one place after exhausting a victim. It seems to be drawn to travel from place to place for some unknown reason. Those who would stalk these creatures are often placed in a situation where they must defeat it quickly or it escapes them. It is often possible, however, to track a harrla from town to town simply by keeping records of unusual events. For example, if a party of adventurers suspects that a hate-causing harrla is in their area, they might locate it by making a map and marking places where unusual acts of violence have occurred.</p><p>Of course, this method of tracking a harrla does not work for those that infuse less obvious emotions. A harrla that causes its victims to experience passion or fear, for example, might be much harder to track since reports of its activities would be far less likely to surface.</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Ecology:</b> The harrla seems to be a natural creature. While some speculate that it is undead or of extraplanar origin, there seems to be little proof of this. Most sages agree that the harrla is not a product of the negative material plane, as most undead are. It appears to be a natural creature that stalks mankind in much the same way that <a href=\"/appendix/wolf\">wolves</a> might hunt sheep who have wandered from the flock.</p><p>Although little is understood about the harrla's need for emotional energy, several theories have been put forth to account for the creature's behavior. Perhaps the most convincing of these is that the harrla stimulates emotions in others because it lacks them itself. According to this school of thought, the harrla's soul is barren and without happiness. In order to experience the joys of emotion, such as the warm touch of a lover's kiss, the stimulating fury of an angry rage, or the vibrant excitement of terror, the creature must make use of proxies.</p><p>If true, this theory explains much, including the creature's apparent attraction to those who do not normally display the emotion that it stimulates, for it desires to share the thrill of these emotions with those who also, in its mind, lack them. Whether this is true or not, only further studies of the creature's tragic influence will tell.</p>\n","images":["<img src=\"grf/fr.gif\" width=\"150\" height=\"75\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Forgotten Realms\" title=\"Forgotten Realms\" align=\"right\">","<img src=\"img/harrla.gif\" alt=\"Harrla\" title=\"Harrla\" border=\"0\" width=\"300\" height=\"360\" style=\"text-align:right;\" align=\"right\">","<img src=\"grf/add2_01.gif\" width=\"200\" height=\"56\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Advanced Dungeons & Dragons 2nd Edition\">"],"setting":"Forgotten Realms","statblock":{"Harrla":{"Activity Cycle":"Night","Alignment":"Chaotic evil","Armor Class":"0","Climate/Terrain":"Any urban area","Damage/Attack":"Nil","Diet":"Life energy","Frequency":"Very rare","Hit Dice":"4+3","Intelligence":"Very (11-12)","Magic Resistance":"Nil","Morale":"Fearless (20)","Movement":"Fl 15 (A)","No. Appearing":"1","No. of Attacks":"0","Organization":"Solitary","Size":"M (6' tall)","Special Attacks":"Emotion control","Special Defenses":"See below","THAC0":"15","Treasure":"Nil","XP Value":"5,000"}},"title":"Harrla"},"sources":["2125"],"statblock_names":[],"title":"Harrla","prev_key":"harrier","next_key":"hatori","monster_path":"/appendix/harrla"}},"staticQueryHashes":[],"slicesMap":{}}
