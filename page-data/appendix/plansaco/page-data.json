While the powers listed above are the most common, some aarakocra have different or additional powers.</p><p class=\"f\">A race of intelligent, birdlike creatures living in the deepest deserts of Athas, the rare Athasian <a href=\"/appendix/aarakocr\">aarakocra</a> spends its time soaring on thermals in search of food.</p><p>The aarakocra is 7 to 8 feet tall with a wingspan of 20 feet or more. Because of its large wingspan, an aarakocra can carry as much as 75% of its own body weight and still fly easily. An aarakocra can fly a short distance carrying a burden equaling 125% of its own body weight. The average body weight of a full grown male is 100 pounds and a female is 85 pounds.</p><p>Each wing has a &ldquo;hand&rdquo; at its midpoint, consisting of three fingers and an opposable thumb. The fourth finger forms the rigid leading edge of the wing. In flight the hands cannot be used, but on the ground the aarakocra can use its hands almost as a human would. The aarakocra's body is protected by a thin bony plate on the chest, much like a solid rib cage. Talons on its legs can be used as claws and can be retracted to reveal a second set of hands, also with three fingers and an opposable thumb. Except for the chest plate, the entire skeleton is hollow and extremely fragile.</p><p>From a distance, the Athasian aarakocra resembles a huge <a href=\"/appendix/bird\">vulture</a>. Its black eyes, set in the front of the head, provide excellent vision over a long range. The plumage is generally black with a white collar for adult males and black or brown with a smaller white collar for females. Adolescents are a mixture of brown and black. The beak is large and covers most of the head. Plumage begins at the crown of the head and is darker near the head, except for the collar. Athasian aarakocra speak their own language and the languages of vultures and other large birds. Some speak the common tongue (5% to 10% chance depending on how deep in the wastelands a tribe lives).</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Combat:</b> Aarakocra can fight in the air or on the ground. They prefer aerial combat since their bones are too fragile to withstand a solid blow from a human-sized opponent. In combat against creatures on the ground, they prefer to fly over their victim and drop weighted nets. Some aarakocra use darts to harass ground-based opponents.</p><p>If their opponents can fly, the aarakocra generally forgo the use of the net, although large groups sometimes use nets on flying creatures. Normally, aarakocra attack flying creatures with long spears, diving from above and allowing the momentum to carry the spear through the target. Such an attack doubles the damage if the aarakocra have been able to dive at least 50 feet. Only the very largest aarakocra can carry more than one of these spears, they can attack with both at once with no penalty, causing double damage on each strike. All diving attacks are made at +4 and should be treated as a charge attack. All other penalties and restrictions of charge attacks apply.</p><p>The effect of the aarakocra's nets depends on if the opponent is flying at the time it becomes entangled. Creatures on the ground that are hit by a net are entangled and unable to participate in any combat until they make a successful Strength check to get free of the net. Flying creatures hit by a net can no longer fly and immediately begin falling. If they cannot escape the net or use some magical means to arrest the fall, normal falling damage applies.</p><p>Unless victims are entangled in nets, aarakocra are cautious in ground combat. If the aarakocra outnumber their opponents they advance in a straight line and thrust with their spears. If outnumbered, or the opponents are particularly tough, the aarakocra withdraw. Victims entangled in nets are killed or incapacitated for use as food or ransom.</p><p>Athasian aarakocra are mindful of their physical limitations as well as their comparatively low psionic abilities. They do not normally initiate psionic combat. At the first sign of psionic powers from any of their victims, however, all aarakocra that have some ability will use whatever attack and defense modes they can in an attempt to destroy the threat. Large groups of is or more aarakocra may initiate psionic combat if their leaders feel they can win quickly and avoid physical combat.</p><p>In desperation, an aarakocra can attempt to bite an opponent in combat. Because of the unwieldiness of its beak, the aarakocra has a THAC0 of 18 if attacking with this appendage. Further, the birdman causes only 1d2 points of damage with the beak.</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Habitat/Society:</b> Athasian aarakocra live in tribes with 6-20 (2d8+4) members, depending on the prestige of the leader. The largest tribe ever recorded had 50 members. The tribal hunting territory depends on the size of the tribe, usually about 500 square miles for a tribe of 10 members. There are no rigid boundaries between tribes and border disputes are not uncommon.</p><p>Alignments of tribe members are similar to the alignment of the leader. A tribe that has a leader who is neutral good may have neutral good, chaotic good, lawful good, and true neutral members. A predominantly evil tribe does not recognize boundaries with other tribes and treats other tribes as inferior beings to be eliminated.</p><p>Athasian aarakocra aren't happy in enclosed spaces, but they they take refuge in a cave or building if necessary.</p><p>Nonevil tribes live in rocky aeries in the highest peaks they can find. Evil tribes are normally nomadic and use an aerie made by another tribe if they need to remain in an area for a long time, even if they have to evict the tribe that made the nest.</p><p>Aarakocra aren't friendly toward intruders in their territory, especially caravans. They try to extract a toll from the caravan for passage through the desert. Good-aligned tribes allow unhindered passage of caravans that pay a tribute. If someone refuses to pay the tribute, the aarakocra try to capture scouts or outriders from the party and hold them until an even larger tribute is paid. The payment may be either livestock or shiny objects. Aarakocra are smart enough not to be taken in by glass baubles instead of gems, although they cannot tell the difference between the more common gems and the rare ones.</p><p>Evil tribes ask for tribute and often attack a caravan whether it pays or not. Aarakocra always demand shiny objects such as stones. These tribes find humans and demihumans to be quite tasty and prefer them to other food.</p><p>Good-aligned tribes of aarakocra sometimes return a lost traveler to the edge of the desert after first removing any valuables the traveler may be carrying. On very rare occasions a tribe might return a lost group of travelers to the more frequently traveled parts of the desert, again after first taking any valuables as payment.</p><p>The oldest male is the leader of the tribal hunting party and has 4+4 Hit Dice. The oldest female is in charge of the tribal aerie and has 3+3 HD. In tribes that have more than 15 members, the next oldest aarakocra serves as shaman and has 3+3 HD; the shaman completes the triumvirate necessary for proper worship and the summoning of elementals. (Interestingly, no magic-using aarakocra has ever been recorded.) Tribes without a shaman cannot summon <a href=\"/appendix/element1\">air elementals</a>, which is an important part of aarakocra culture.</p><p>The shaman is the leader of the daily sun worship. Aarakocra worship the sun because it provides them with the thermals they need to soar in search of food. The shaman also leads the mystic rituals used to summon an air elemental. Summoning an air elemental is usually done only in preparation for the tribe's most sacred ceremony, the hunt. Small tribes must band together for this ceremony to allow the triumvirate to be formed.</p><p>The ceremony to summon an air elemental must be conducted at dawn and requires the oldest male and female to emit a highpitched keening whistle. The shaman conducts an intricate dance around them, simultaneously chanting an ancient summoning mantra.</p><p>The hunt is the final part of the initiation of adolescent aarakocra to adulthood and often takes the tribe far from their normal teritory. The target is always a <a href=\"/appendix/drakalsi\">silt drake</a>. The hunt is the only time the females leave the relative safety of the nest. Even an evil tribe will not interfere with a tribe on a hunt. An air elemental is often summoned to help find the drake, but never takes part in the actual combat. Although the adult members of the tribe take part in the initial phases of the combat, it is the initiates who deliver the final, killing blows to me drake. Scars from the hunt are considered a mark of pride among all aarakocra.</p><p>The females spend about eight months of the year incubating their eggs. Athasian aarakocra mate for life and a pair normally produces as many as 10 offspring. A female lays one egg a year. Constant incubation is not required because of the high daytime temperatures, so the females can maintain the nest and keep the tribe's treasure in order.</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Ecology:</b> Athasian aarakocra are high on the food chain and have no natural enemies other than <a href=\"/appendix/drakatha\">drakes</a>. Unless evil, aarakocra leave their own territory only to hunt the silt drake and return as soon as possible when the hunt is over. (Evil aarakocra attack others, as noted above.) Aarakocra eggs and hatchlings are sought after by wealthy land owners who wish to use the creatures as scouts and sentries. An egg can bring as much as 10 cp in Tyr's marketplace. Tribes that have had eggs or hatchlings stolen have long memories and sometimes take revenge against the thief at a later date. Captive aarakocra join any tribe they come in contact with.</p><p>Athasian aarakocra have a natural life span of 21-30 years.</p><p></p><br clear=\"all\" style=\"clear:both; height:0;\">\r\n","images":["<img src=\"grf/ds.gif\" width=\"150\" height=\"75\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Dark Sun\" title=\"Dark Sun\" align=\"right\">","<img src=\"img/aarakath.gif\" alt=\"Aarakocra (Athas)\" title=\"Aarakocra (Athas)\" border=\"0\" width=\"300\" height=\"360\" style=\"text-align:right;\" align=\"right\">","<img src=\"grf/add2_01.gif\" width=\"200\" height=\"56\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Advanced Dungeons & Dragons 2nd Edition\">"],"setting":"Dark Sun","statblock":{"Aarakocra (Athas)":{"Activity Cycle":"Day","Alignment":"Any","Armor Class":"7","Climate/Terrain":"Deep desert","Damage/Attack":"1d3/1d3 or by weapon","Diet":"Carnivore","Frequency":"Rare","Hit Dice":"2+2","Intelligence":"Average (8-10)","Magic Resistance":"Nil","Morale":"Steady (11)","Movement":"6, Fl 36 (C)","No. Appearing":"1d10","No. of Attacks":"2","Organization":"Tribal","Size":"M (20'+ wingspan)","Special Attacks":"Nil","Special Defenses":"Nil","THAC0":"17","Treasure":"Varies","XP Value":"65"}},"title":"Aarakocra (Athas)"},"sources":["2433"],"statblock_names":[],"title":"Aarakocra (Athas)","prev_key":"zygraat","next_key":"aarakocr","monster_path":"/appendix/aarakath"}}},"pageContext":{"monster_key":"plansaco","monster_data":{"TSR":["2524"],"fullBody":"  <table cellspacing=\"0\" cellpadding=\"0\"><tr class=\"bk\"><th> </th><th class=\"cn\">Amber Lotus</th><th class=\"cn\">Eyeweed</th><th class=\"cn\">Vermeil Fungus</th><th class=\"cn\">Scarlet Pimpernel</th><th class=\"cn\">Gargoan Rose</th></tr><tr><th>Climate/Terrain:</th><td>River</td><td>Aquatic</td><td>Any</td><td>Any</td><td>Forest</td></tr><tr><th>Frequency:</th><td>Common</td><td>Rare</td><td>Rare</td><td>Rare</td><td>Rare</td></tr><tr><th>Organization:</th><td>Bed</td><td>Solitary</td><td>Multicellular</td><td>Bed</td><td>Solitary</td></tr><tr><th>Activity Cycle:</th><td>Any</td><td>Any</td><td>Any</td><td>Day</td><td>Day</td></tr><tr><th>Diet:</th><td>Nil</td><td>Carnivore</td><td>Scavenger</td><td>Special</td><td>Nil</td></tr><tr><th>Intelligence:</th><td>Non- (0)</td><td>Animal (1)</td><td>Non- (0)</td><td>Semi- (2-4)</td><td>Low (5-7)</td></tr><tr><th>Treasure:</th><td>Nil</td><td>Nil</td><td>Nil</td><td>Nil</td><td>Nil</td></tr><tr><th>Alignment:</th><td>Neutral</td><td>Neutral</td><td>Neutral</td><td>Neutral</td><td>Chaotic good</td></tr><tr><th>No. Appearing:</th><td>1</td><td>1</td><td>2d4</td><td>2d4</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><th>Armor Class:</th><td>10</td><td>7</td><td>7</td><td>10</td><td>10</td></tr><tr><th>Movement:</th><td>Nil</td><td>1</td><td>1</td><td>Nil</td><td>Nil</td></tr><tr><th>Hit Dice:</th><td>1 hp</td><td>8</td><td>3</td><td>1</td><td>2</td></tr><tr><th>THAC0:</th><td>20</td><td>13</td><td>17</td><td>19</td><td>19</td></tr><tr><th>No. of Attacks:</th><td>0</td><td>2d4 (feelers)</td><td>0</td><td>0</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><th>Damage/Attack:</th><td>Nil</td><td>1d3</td><td>Nil</td><td>Nil</td><td>Nil</td></tr><tr><th>Special Attacks:</th><td>Sleep</td><td>Nil</td><td>Detonating cloud</td><td>Legacies</td><td>Legacies</td></tr><tr><th>Special Defenses:</th><td>Nil</td><td>Nil</td><td>Nil</td><td>Legacies</td><td>Singing</td></tr><tr><th>Magic Resistance:</th><td>Nil</td><td>Nil</td><td>Nil</td><td>Nil</td><td>Nil</td></tr><tr><th>Size:</th><td>S (1' diameter)</td><td>L <nobr>(10' diameter)</nobr></td><td>M (4-7' tall)</td><td>T (2-3' tall)</td><td>T (2-3' tall)</td></tr><tr><th>Morale:</th><td>Average <nobr>(8-10)</nobr></td><td>Steady (11-12)</td><td>Steady (11-12)</td><td>Steady (11-12)</td><td>Steady (11-12)</td></tr><tr><th>XP Value:</th><td>35/1,400</td><td>975</td><td>175</td><td>65</td><td>35</td></tr></table><p class=\"f\"><b>Amber Lotus</b></p>  <p class=\"ni\">The amber lotus is a variety of aquatic plant thriving in the Dream River marking the eastern border of Renardy. The amber lotus has wide, circular leaves, much like those found on a water lily. Depending on the winds, amber lotus pollen can travel for miles, sticking to everything it touches (grass, trees, creatures, etc.). Amber lotus pollen acts as a powerful sleeping poison. Anyone who comes in contact with the pollen must make a successful saving throw vs. poison with a -2 penalty or fall asleep for a minimum 1d4+1 days. If the wind does not shift, the victim will never wake up. The victims of the sleeping pollen often die from attacks by other creatures while asleep. Their bodies then decay and provide nourishment for the plants.</p><p>The powerful sleeping effect of the amber lotus has so far prevented both Eusdrian and Renardois expansion to the north. <a href=\"/appendix/batracin\">Batracines</a> are immune to amber lotus and can often be found hiding underneath or sitting on the lotus pads.</p><p>A bed of amber lotus contains 3d100+100 plants. Anyone approaching closer to the bed than 1 yard per plant is affected by the sleeping spores.</p><p>A victim who survives an encounter with the amber lotus receives 35 experience points. Actually wiping out a bed of these plants earns characters an additional award of 1,400 experience points.</p><p></p><p class=\"f\"><b>Eyeweed</b></p>  <p class=\"ni\">Eyeweed is a hideous semi-aquatic plant that grows on the on the seashores and in the rivers of the Savage Coast, usually near otherwise safe harbors. Eyeweed appears as either seaweed or a large collection of algae.</p><p>Eyeweed, when hunting prey, sends out long feelers (up to 100 feet in length) along the coastline to look for food. The feelers resemble long vines or stalks - except that the ends appear to be bulbous, unblinking eyes. In actuality, the eyeweed hunts by touch and smell; the unblinking &ldquo;eyes&rdquo; are actually closed mouths that attack by biting and then sucking meat, blood, and even bone into the eyeweed's body.</p><p>Once it locates potential prey, the eyeweed attacks with 2d4 feelers. Each feeler does 1d3 points of damage per attack. Each feeler can sustain 6 hit points of damage before being severed. The eyeweed will regrow lost feelers within a week. Damage to the feelers does no damage to the eyeweed itself; only damage to the central body will kill the eyeweed.</p><p>Eyeweeds will feed on wounded or exhausted <a href=\"/appendix/echyan\">echyans</a> if given the opportunity.</p><p></p><p class=\"f\"><b>Vermeil Fungus</b></p>  <p class=\"ni\">Vermeil fungi are relatives of the <a href=\"/appendix/fungus\">gas spores</a>. When attacked or disturbed, these large, crimson mushrooms release a thick red cloud that resembles <i>vermeil</i>. This cloud has the same effect on <i>cinnabryl</i> as detonating smokepowder (see the section on &ldquo;Depletion of <i>Cinnabryl</i>&rdquo; in <i>The Savage Coast Campaign Book</i>). All vulnerable creatures within a 30-foot radius are affected. Vermeil fungus feeds on deposits of <i>steel seed</i> or the decaying bodies of Legacy-using creatures. It is often found along with <a href=\"/appendix/parasaco\">vermilia</a>.</p><p></p><p class=\"f\"><b>Scarlet Pimpernel</b></p>  <p class=\"ni\">This elegant-looking orchid grows on <i>cinnabryl</i> deposits and the graves of dead, Legacy-using creatures, often along with vermilia. When eaten, scarlet pimpernel temporarily boosts the effects of Legacies. The effect lasts one turn, during which time all Legacy effects (duration, range, damage, etc.) are boosted by 10%. The dried form is three times stronger (lasts three turns, boosts Legacy effects by 30%) than the fresh form, but it also causes delirium. Anyone who eats dried scarlet pimpernel must make a successful saving throw vs. poison with a -3 penalty or suffer a hallucination. This hallucination lasts for 1d6 turns, during which time the victim is unable to respond to events in the real world, even those that are potentially deadly.</p><p>The crimson delight, on the other hand, is an identical-looking plant often found mixed in with scarlet pimpernels. The crimson delight is deadly in its fresh form; anyone who eats fresh crimson delight must make a successful saving throw vs. poison or die. In its dried form, it prevents the use of Legacies for 24 hours. <a href=\"/appendix/voat\">Voats</a> can also be found near scarlet pimpernels.</p><p>Each bed of these plants has a Legacy appropriate to the region where it is found; they can be offensive or defensive. These plants use their dim intelligence to control the Legacy. If its Legacy is used more than three times in one day, the pimpernel acquires a different Legacy (selected randomly from the list), which it can use it up to three times, and so on. A bed of scarlet pimpernels can continue to use its Legacy-of-the-moment as long as at least one plant is left.</p><p>A bed of plants depletes <i>cinnabryl</i> at the normal speed (one ounce per week). Without <i>cinnabryl</i>, the plants quickly dry up. If this happens, they release spores that ride the wind in search of new deposits.</p><p></p><p class=\"f\"><b>Gargoan Rose</b></p>  <p class=\"ni\">This white rose has the ability to temporarily freeze the effects of the Red Curse. When plucked from its bush, the rose acts as one ounce of <i>cinnabryl</i>, wilting as it depletes. At the end of the seventh day, the last petal drops and its protection ceases. Anyone currently protected by a Gargoan rose cannot use his Legacies.</p><p>The Gargoan rose bush is a sentient being, with senses based on smell and empathy. The Immortal Valerias originally created its species as a gesture of compassion toward the poor and the Afflicted.</p><p>The bush allows only one rose to be plucked each week. If more than one rose is removed or if someone attempts to dig it out of the ground, the bush activates its own Legacy defenses: Acid Touch, Entangle, Poison, and Weaken. In addition, the Gargoan rose bush has the ability to Sing. Its melody can <i>charm monsters</i> within a one mile radius, which it then uses to defend itself against foes.</p><p>The bushes grow in Shazak and Herathian forests, in the hallowed forests of Robrenn, as well as in Gargoa near places where the Afflicted have died. Gargoans consider these bushes sacred gifts from the Immortals; tampering with one (attempting to uproot the bush or take more than one rose) is a capital crime in Gargoa.</p><p>A person who encounters a Gargoan rose bush or uses one of the special roses should receive a one-time award of 35 experience points. No experience points are awarded for destroying one of these bushes.</p><p></p><br clear=\"all\" style=\"clear:both; height:0;\">\r\n","images":["<img src=\"grf/rs.gif\" width=\"150\" height=\"75\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Red Steel (Mystara)\" title=\"Red Steel (Mystara)\" align=\"right\">","<img src=\"img/plansaco.gif\" alt=\"Plant (Savage Coast)\" title=\"Plant (Savage Coast)\" border=\"0\" width=\"300\" height=\"360\" style=\"text-align:right;\" align=\"right\">","<img src=\"grf/add2_01.gif\" width=\"200\" height=\"56\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Advanced Dungeons & Dragons 2nd Edition\">"],"setting":"Red Steel (Mystara)","statblock":{"Amber Lotus":{"Activity Cycle":"Any","Alignment":"Neutral","Armor Class":"10","Climate/Terrain":"River","Damage/Attack":"Nil","Diet":"Nil","Frequency":"Common","Hit Dice":"1 hp","Intelligence":"Non- (0)","Magic Resistance":"Nil","Morale":"Average <nobr>(8-10)</nobr>","Movement":"Nil","No. Appearing":"1","No. of Attacks":"0","Organization":"Bed","Size":"S (1' diameter)","Special Attacks":"Sleep","Special Defenses":"Nil","THAC0":"20","Treasure":"Nil","XP Value":"35/1,400"},"Eyeweed":{"Activity Cycle":"Any","Alignment":"Neutral","Armor Class":"7","Climate/Terrain":"Aquatic","Damage/Attack":"1d3","Diet":"Carnivore","Frequency":"Rare","Hit Dice":"8","Intelligence":"Animal (1)","Magic Resistance":"Nil","Morale":"Steady (11-12)","Movement":"1","No. Appearing":"1","No. of Attacks":"2d4 (feelers)","Organization":"Solitary","Size":"L <nobr>(10' diameter)</nobr>","Special Attacks":"Nil","Special Defenses":"Nil","THAC0":"13","Treasure":"Nil","XP Value":"975"},"Gargoan Rose":{"Activity Cycle":"Day","Alignment":"Chaotic good","Armor Class":"10","Climate/Terrain":"Forest","Damage/Attack":"Nil","Diet":"Nil","Frequency":"Rare","Hit Dice":"2","Intelligence":"Low (5-7)","Magic Resistance":"Nil","Morale":"Steady (11-12)","Movement":"Nil","No. Appearing":"1","No. of Attacks":"0","Organization":"Solitary","Size":"T (2-3' tall)","Special Attacks":"Legacies","Special Defenses":"Singing","THAC0":"19","Treasure":"Nil","XP Value":"35"},"Scarlet Pimpernel":{"Activity Cycle":"Day","Alignment":"Neutral","Armor Class":"10","Climate/Terrain":"Any","Damage/Attack":"Nil","Diet":"Special","Frequency":"Rare","Hit Dice":"1","Intelligence":"Semi- (2-4)","Magic Resistance":"Nil","Morale":"Steady (11-12)","Movement":"Nil","No. Appearing":"2d4","No. of Attacks":"0","Organization":"Bed","Size":"T (2-3' tall)","Special Attacks":"Legacies","Special Defenses":"Legacies","THAC0":"19","Treasure":"Nil","XP Value":"65"},"Vermeil Fungus":{"Activity Cycle":"Any","Alignment":"Neutral","Armor Class":"7","Climate/Terrain":"Any","Damage/Attack":"Nil","Diet":"Scavenger","Frequency":"Rare","Hit Dice":"3","Intelligence":"Non- (0)","Magic Resistance":"Nil","Morale":"Steady (11-12)","Movement":"1","No. Appearing":"2d4","No. of Attacks":"0","Organization":"Multicellular","Size":"M (4-7' tall)","Special Attacks":"Detonating cloud","Special Defenses":"Nil","THAC0":"17","Treasure":"Nil","XP Value":"175"}},"title":"Plant (Savage Coast)"},"sources":["2524"],"statblock_names":[],"title":"Plant (Savage Coast)","prev_key":"planinte","next_key":"planvamo","monster_path":"/appendix/plansaco"}},"staticQueryHashes":[],"slicesMap":{}}
