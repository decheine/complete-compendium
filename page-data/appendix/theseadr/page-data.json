While the powers listed above are the most common, some aarakocra have different or additional powers.</p><p class=\"f\">A race of intelligent, birdlike creatures living in the deepest deserts of Athas, the rare Athasian <a href=\"/appendix/aarakocr\">aarakocra</a> spends its time soaring on thermals in search of food.</p><p>The aarakocra is 7 to 8 feet tall with a wingspan of 20 feet or more. Because of its large wingspan, an aarakocra can carry as much as 75% of its own body weight and still fly easily. An aarakocra can fly a short distance carrying a burden equaling 125% of its own body weight. The average body weight of a full grown male is 100 pounds and a female is 85 pounds.</p><p>Each wing has a &ldquo;hand&rdquo; at its midpoint, consisting of three fingers and an opposable thumb. The fourth finger forms the rigid leading edge of the wing. In flight the hands cannot be used, but on the ground the aarakocra can use its hands almost as a human would. The aarakocra's body is protected by a thin bony plate on the chest, much like a solid rib cage. Talons on its legs can be used as claws and can be retracted to reveal a second set of hands, also with three fingers and an opposable thumb. Except for the chest plate, the entire skeleton is hollow and extremely fragile.</p><p>From a distance, the Athasian aarakocra resembles a huge <a href=\"/appendix/bird\">vulture</a>. Its black eyes, set in the front of the head, provide excellent vision over a long range. The plumage is generally black with a white collar for adult males and black or brown with a smaller white collar for females. Adolescents are a mixture of brown and black. The beak is large and covers most of the head. Plumage begins at the crown of the head and is darker near the head, except for the collar. Athasian aarakocra speak their own language and the languages of vultures and other large birds. Some speak the common tongue (5% to 10% chance depending on how deep in the wastelands a tribe lives).</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Combat:</b> Aarakocra can fight in the air or on the ground. They prefer aerial combat since their bones are too fragile to withstand a solid blow from a human-sized opponent. In combat against creatures on the ground, they prefer to fly over their victim and drop weighted nets. Some aarakocra use darts to harass ground-based opponents.</p><p>If their opponents can fly, the aarakocra generally forgo the use of the net, although large groups sometimes use nets on flying creatures. Normally, aarakocra attack flying creatures with long spears, diving from above and allowing the momentum to carry the spear through the target. Such an attack doubles the damage if the aarakocra have been able to dive at least 50 feet. Only the very largest aarakocra can carry more than one of these spears, they can attack with both at once with no penalty, causing double damage on each strike. All diving attacks are made at +4 and should be treated as a charge attack. All other penalties and restrictions of charge attacks apply.</p><p>The effect of the aarakocra's nets depends on if the opponent is flying at the time it becomes entangled. Creatures on the ground that are hit by a net are entangled and unable to participate in any combat until they make a successful Strength check to get free of the net. Flying creatures hit by a net can no longer fly and immediately begin falling. If they cannot escape the net or use some magical means to arrest the fall, normal falling damage applies.</p><p>Unless victims are entangled in nets, aarakocra are cautious in ground combat. If the aarakocra outnumber their opponents they advance in a straight line and thrust with their spears. If outnumbered, or the opponents are particularly tough, the aarakocra withdraw. Victims entangled in nets are killed or incapacitated for use as food or ransom.</p><p>Athasian aarakocra are mindful of their physical limitations as well as their comparatively low psionic abilities. They do not normally initiate psionic combat. At the first sign of psionic powers from any of their victims, however, all aarakocra that have some ability will use whatever attack and defense modes they can in an attempt to destroy the threat. Large groups of is or more aarakocra may initiate psionic combat if their leaders feel they can win quickly and avoid physical combat.</p><p>In desperation, an aarakocra can attempt to bite an opponent in combat. Because of the unwieldiness of its beak, the aarakocra has a THAC0 of 18 if attacking with this appendage. Further, the birdman causes only 1d2 points of damage with the beak.</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Habitat/Society:</b> Athasian aarakocra live in tribes with 6-20 (2d8+4) members, depending on the prestige of the leader. The largest tribe ever recorded had 50 members. The tribal hunting territory depends on the size of the tribe, usually about 500 square miles for a tribe of 10 members. There are no rigid boundaries between tribes and border disputes are not uncommon.</p><p>Alignments of tribe members are similar to the alignment of the leader. A tribe that has a leader who is neutral good may have neutral good, chaotic good, lawful good, and true neutral members. A predominantly evil tribe does not recognize boundaries with other tribes and treats other tribes as inferior beings to be eliminated.</p><p>Athasian aarakocra aren't happy in enclosed spaces, but they they take refuge in a cave or building if necessary.</p><p>Nonevil tribes live in rocky aeries in the highest peaks they can find. Evil tribes are normally nomadic and use an aerie made by another tribe if they need to remain in an area for a long time, even if they have to evict the tribe that made the nest.</p><p>Aarakocra aren't friendly toward intruders in their territory, especially caravans. They try to extract a toll from the caravan for passage through the desert. Good-aligned tribes allow unhindered passage of caravans that pay a tribute. If someone refuses to pay the tribute, the aarakocra try to capture scouts or outriders from the party and hold them until an even larger tribute is paid. The payment may be either livestock or shiny objects. Aarakocra are smart enough not to be taken in by glass baubles instead of gems, although they cannot tell the difference between the more common gems and the rare ones.</p><p>Evil tribes ask for tribute and often attack a caravan whether it pays or not. Aarakocra always demand shiny objects such as stones. These tribes find humans and demihumans to be quite tasty and prefer them to other food.</p><p>Good-aligned tribes of aarakocra sometimes return a lost traveler to the edge of the desert after first removing any valuables the traveler may be carrying. On very rare occasions a tribe might return a lost group of travelers to the more frequently traveled parts of the desert, again after first taking any valuables as payment.</p><p>The oldest male is the leader of the tribal hunting party and has 4+4 Hit Dice. The oldest female is in charge of the tribal aerie and has 3+3 HD. In tribes that have more than 15 members, the next oldest aarakocra serves as shaman and has 3+3 HD; the shaman completes the triumvirate necessary for proper worship and the summoning of elementals. (Interestingly, no magic-using aarakocra has ever been recorded.) Tribes without a shaman cannot summon <a href=\"/appendix/element1\">air elementals</a>, which is an important part of aarakocra culture.</p><p>The shaman is the leader of the daily sun worship. Aarakocra worship the sun because it provides them with the thermals they need to soar in search of food. The shaman also leads the mystic rituals used to summon an air elemental. Summoning an air elemental is usually done only in preparation for the tribe's most sacred ceremony, the hunt. Small tribes must band together for this ceremony to allow the triumvirate to be formed.</p><p>The ceremony to summon an air elemental must be conducted at dawn and requires the oldest male and female to emit a highpitched keening whistle. The shaman conducts an intricate dance around them, simultaneously chanting an ancient summoning mantra.</p><p>The hunt is the final part of the initiation of adolescent aarakocra to adulthood and often takes the tribe far from their normal teritory. The target is always a <a href=\"/appendix/drakalsi\">silt drake</a>. The hunt is the only time the females leave the relative safety of the nest. Even an evil tribe will not interfere with a tribe on a hunt. An air elemental is often summoned to help find the drake, but never takes part in the actual combat. Although the adult members of the tribe take part in the initial phases of the combat, it is the initiates who deliver the final, killing blows to me drake. Scars from the hunt are considered a mark of pride among all aarakocra.</p><p>The females spend about eight months of the year incubating their eggs. Athasian aarakocra mate for life and a pair normally produces as many as 10 offspring. A female lays one egg a year. Constant incubation is not required because of the high daytime temperatures, so the females can maintain the nest and keep the tribe's treasure in order.</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Ecology:</b> Athasian aarakocra are high on the food chain and have no natural enemies other than <a href=\"/appendix/drakatha\">drakes</a>. Unless evil, aarakocra leave their own territory only to hunt the silt drake and return as soon as possible when the hunt is over. (Evil aarakocra attack others, as noted above.) Aarakocra eggs and hatchlings are sought after by wealthy land owners who wish to use the creatures as scouts and sentries. An egg can bring as much as 10 cp in Tyr's marketplace. Tribes that have had eggs or hatchlings stolen have long memories and sometimes take revenge against the thief at a later date. Captive aarakocra join any tribe they come in contact with.</p><p>Athasian aarakocra have a natural life span of 21-30 years.</p>\n","images":["<img src=\"grf/ds.gif\" width=\"150\" height=\"75\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Dark Sun\" title=\"Dark Sun\" align=\"right\">","<img src=\"img/aarakath.gif\" alt=\"Aarakocra (Athas)\" title=\"Aarakocra (Athas)\" border=\"0\" width=\"300\" height=\"360\" style=\"text-align:right;\" align=\"right\">","<img src=\"grf/add2_01.gif\" width=\"200\" height=\"56\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Advanced Dungeons & Dragons 2nd Edition\">"],"setting":"Dark Sun","statblock":{"Aarakocra (Athas)":{"Activity Cycle":"Day","Alignment":"Any","Armor Class":"7","Climate/Terrain":"Deep desert","Damage/Attack":"1d3/1d3 or by weapon","Diet":"Carnivore","Frequency":"Rare","Hit Dice":"2+2","Intelligence":"Average (8-10)","Magic Resistance":"Nil","Morale":"Steady (11)","Movement":"6, Fl 36 (C)","No. Appearing":"1d10","No. of Attacks":"2","Organization":"Tribal","Size":"M (20'+ wingspan)","Special Attacks":"Nil","Special Defenses":"Nil","THAC0":"17","Treasure":"Varies","XP Value":"65"}},"title":"Aarakocra (Athas)"},"sources":["2433"],"statblock_names":[],"title":"Aarakocra (Athas)","prev_key":"zygraat","next_key":"aarakocr","monster_path":"/appendix/aarakath"}}},"pageContext":{"monster_key":"theseadr","monster_data":{"TSR":["3100"],"fullBody":"  <table cellspacing=\"0\" cellpadding=\"0\"><tr><th>Climate/Terrain:</th>  <td>The Straits of Aerele/Baerghos Island</td></tr><tr><th>Frequency:</th>        <td>Unique</td></tr><tr><th>Organization:</th>     <td>Solitary/Regent</td></tr><tr><th>Activity Cycle:</th>   <td>Any</td></tr><tr><th>Diet:</th>             <td>Omnivorous</td></tr><tr><th>Intelligence:</th>     <td>Average (10)</td></tr><tr><th>Treasure:</th>         <td>Domain Treasure (50 GB+ from sunken ships)</td></tr><tr><th>Alignment:</th>        <td>Neutral</td></tr><tr><th>No. Appearing:</th>    <td>1</td></tr><tr><th>Armor Class:</th>      <td>0</td></tr><tr><th>Movement:</th>         <td>6, Sw 24</td></tr><tr><th>Hit Dice:</th>         <td>15 (100hp)</td></tr><tr><th>THAC0:</th>            <td>5</td></tr><tr><th>No. of Attacks:</th>   <td>1 (bite) or 2 (flukes)</td></tr><tr><th>Damage/Attack:</th>    <td>3d10 or 2d8/2d8</td></tr><tr><th>Special Attacks:</th>  <td>Crushing coils, swallow</td></tr><tr><th>Special Defenses:</th> <td>Regeneration, ink cloud</td></tr><tr><th>Magic Resistance:</th> <td>Nil</td></tr><tr><th>Size:</th>             <td>L (50' long)</td></tr><tr><th>Morale:</th>           <td>Fanatic ( 17)</td></tr><tr><th>Blood:</th>            <td>Great (Azrai): 80</td></tr><tr><th>Blood Abilities:</th>  <td>Bloodform (great), Major Regeneration (great), Regeneration (great)</td></tr><tr><th>XP Value:</th>         <td>14,000</td></tr></table><p class=\"f\">About 600 years ago, when the Roeles still lived to rule Anuire, an Anuirean merchant named Garrilein Suliere sailed the Stra its of Aerele, selling grains, steel, and fabrics from Anuire in Mieres, and ret urning with a cargo hold full of gold and spices. It was a good life; he profited from the trade and helped make others wealthy as well.</p><p>Occasionally, he would supplement his cargo with passengers. One mysterious passenger, who paid his weight in gold, proved to be Garrilein's undoing. Though the passage across the Straits lasts only a day, this day would irrevocably change Garrilein's life.</p><p>A storm boiled up, and the passenger's cloak was blown from his face. He was scaled and horned, a horrible lizardlike creature, and he began to slaughter the crew where they stood. Though Garrilein was only an average warrior, he couldn't stand idle while his crew was slaughtered. Summoning all his meager courage, he crept up behind the beast and drove a harpoon through its back. It expired on the harpoon, cursing him all the while.</p><p>Whether it was the curse, or whether the slaying awoke Garrilein's latent blood, he gradually took on the beast's scales over the next few years. He soon could not show his face in public and was forced to deal through intermediaries and couriers. His appearance continued to worsen, until at last he slipped into the sea in an attempt to kill himself.</p><p>He found that immersion in water couldn't kill him; instead, the salt water of the Straits hastened his transformation and he eventually became a small sea serpent. The years have rendered him larger and more powerful; and although he is not actively evil, his transformation continues without cease.</p><p>Although he now has little use for it, the Seadrake still collects treasure. Though he can no longer increase his fortune through honest work, he can now take it from the captains of the vessels that ply the Straits of Aerele. He has terrorized ships for the past 500 years, and after the first few decades, few dared deny him the treasure he seeks.</p><p>However, the Seadrake does not take lives unless forced to do so in self-defense. He makes an exception for the pirate ships that attempt to steal what would be his. Apparently, he feels some obligation to earn the money he takes from the merchants; killing the pirates is his trade-off.</p><p>The Seadrake appears as a SO-foot-long serpent with a large, fanlike crest adorning his back. He is mottled green and blue, and he blends easily into the sometimes turbulent waters of the Straits. Fangs fill his mouth, and the flukes on his forequarters propel him powerfully through the water. He bears no trace of his former humanity except for his morals and his ability to understand all human speech.</p><p>The Seadrake can breathe both water and air without difficulty, but he has trouble moving on land. Although he has been known to pursue enemies onto dry land, he prefers the water, where he's more maneuverable and more dangerous.</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Combat:</b> Ship captains give tribute to the Seadrake with little fuss for good reason. His bite causes 3d10 damage, enough to rend a normal man in a single pass of razor-sharp teeth. Alternatively, he can make a crushing attack with his two tremendous flukes, each causing 2d8 damage. Any breakable object must save vs. crushing blow when hit by his flippers or be shattered.</p><p>The Seadrake has recently discovered that his great size confers two additional forms of attack. He is now of a size such that he can swallow man-sized enemies; when he attacks with his bite, a roll of a natural 19 or 20 means that his victim has been swallowed whole. The victim suffers 1d20 damage passing over rows of teeth and into the Seadrake's gullet, then has 1d6 rounds to cut himself free (by causing 20 points of damage to AC 5) before he drowns and burns to death in powerful stomach bile. Only weapons of size S can be used to cut him; there is no room to wield larger weapons.</p><p>The creature's other newly found attack is his crushing coil. He can wrap his length around any ship with a deck width of 20 feet or less and crush it. If the ship's wood fails a save vs. crushing blow, the hull splinters and the ship slowly sinks.</p><p>The Seadrake can spit an inkcloud from under his flukes to assist his escape. The ink acts as a <i>darkness</i> spell with a SOfoot radius underwater; it is ineffective above water.</p><p>The Seadrake regenerates 2 hp per round while his wounds are underwater. If a wound is exposed to air for more than 3 rounds, it must heal normally. If reduced to -10 hit points, the Seadrake dies.</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Habitat/Society:</b> The Seadrake has no society. He lives alone in a grotto under Baerghos Isle, gazing upon his treasure. A primitive tribe is said to live on the isle and worship the Seadrake as a god, but no one has set foot on the island in over two centuries to verify this.</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Ecology:</b> The Seadrake patrols the Straits of Aerele, eating sharks and whales. If these are not available, he can survive on plankton or seaweed. He drags the tribute donated to him by sailors eager to avoid his wrath to his underwater grotto. A few reckless adventurers have pilfered from. this grotto over the years, and many more plan carefully to enter when the Seadrake is away, but this is a foolish venture, for the Seadrake keeps no schedule, and can return at any instant. Despite his generally passive nature, he will kill anyone who tampers with his treasure. Although he has no use for the treasure, he enjoys its company and guards it jealously.</p><p>A theory has been offered that the Seadrake collects treasure to remind him of his lost humanity. Some say he would do anything to regain that life, or to end this one. They're wrong in one respect-he fights viciously when attacked, as if he were afraid of death.</p><p>Travelers on the Straits should be warned: Though the Seadrake can be bargained with, he demands tribute. He is nothing less than unreasonable if denied. No one has lived to tell a tale of escaping the Seadrake by promising to return with more gold. Though he is greedy, he is not stupid. No one escapes an encounter with the Seadrake with a full purse.</p><img src=\"/img/spc/theseadr.gif\" alt=\"The Seadrake\" title=\"The Seadrake\" border=\"0\">\n","images":["<img src=\"grf/br.gif\" width=\"150\" height=\"75\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Birthright\" title=\"Birthright\" align=\"right\">","<img src=\"/img/spc/theseadr.gif\" alt=\"The Seadrake\" title=\"The Seadrake\" border=\"0\">","<img src=\"grf/tsr_sm.png\" width=\"56\" height=\"59\" border=\"0\" alt=\"TSR\">"],"setting":"Birthright","statblock":{"The Seadrake":{"Activity Cycle":"Any","Alignment":"Neutral","Armor Class":"0","Blood":"Great (Azrai): 80","Blood Abilities":"Bloodform (great), Major Regeneration (great), Regeneration (great)","Climate/Terrain":"The Straits of Aerele/Baerghos Island","Damage/Attack":"3d10 or 2d8/2d8","Diet":"Omnivorous","Frequency":"Unique","Hit Dice":"15 (100hp)","Intelligence":"Average (10)","Magic Resistance":"Nil","Morale":"Fanatic ( 17)","Movement":"6, Sw 24","No. Appearing":"1","No. of Attacks":"1 (bite) or 2 (flukes)","Organization":"Solitary/Regent","Size":"L (50' long)","Special Attacks":"Crushing coils, swallow","Special Defenses":"Regeneration, ink cloud","THAC0":"5","Treasure":"Domain Treasure (50 GB+ from sunken ships)","XP Value":"14,000"}},"title":"The Seadrake"},"sources":["3100"],"statblock_names":[],"title":"The Seadrake","prev_key":"thegorg","next_key":"thesmons","monster_path":"/appendix/theseadr"}},"staticQueryHashes":[],"slicesMap":{}}
