A wemic's body consists of a leonine body with a humanoid torso extending from what would be a <a href=\"/appendix/catgreat\">lion's</a> neck. The typical wemic measures ten feet from head to rump. When standing erect in centaurian posture, the wemic stands 6 to 7 feet tall. Most of the body is covered in dusky golden fur. The tail is tipped by a brush of long, black hair. Adult males also have a mane of long black hair; the mane covers the top and back of the head and extends to the neck and shoulders. Male cubs develop this mane in their third year. The underbelly is covered in short, white fur. The nose may be black or russet. The eyes are gold with vertically slit pupils. The digits on all limbs end in claws. The claws on the forelegs are retractable.</p><p>Wemics speak their own leonine language and a highly accented dialect of the common tongue.</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Combat:</b> Wemics use forepaws and weapons to attack. A claw delivers a vicious swipe that inflicts 1d4 points of damage. Normally the wemic uses his forelegs to claw and employs his hands to wield a weapon.</p><p>Wemic males carry javelins and either a stone club or short sword. They often carry a tough leather shield (AC 5) for protection. Females are AC 7 and do not use weapons; however, they gain a +2 bonus to attack rolls if their cubs are attacked. Cubs under 2 years do not attack.</p><p>Wemics possess keen senses. They are masters of ambushes and hunting strategy. If they cannot surprise an intended victim, 1-3 wemics move to outflank prey.</p><p>Wemics possess powerful leg muscles. They can leap 10 feet upward or 30 feet forward.</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Habitat/Society:</b> Wemic society is a blend of leonine and aboriginal human cultures. They live in groups called prides. A typical pride consists of 4d4 adult males, 2d12 adult females, and 1d12 cubs. Up to 3d10 prides often band together into a tribe that is led by a chief. The chief has an Armor Class of 5, 6+4 Hit Dice, and its claws inflict 1d6 points of damage. It gains a +1 bonus to its attack rolls with any weapon.</p><p>Sometimes 2d4 tribes join together into a clan or nation. Such a grand gathering is led by a king and 2d4 chieftains. The king has an Armor Class of 3, 9 Hit Dice, and claws that inflict 1d8 points of damage. It has a +2 bonus to its attack rolls with any weapon.</p><p>Some wemics are able to use magic. There is a 70% chance that any tribe includes a witch doctor. Such wemics may attain a maximum level of 7th-level priest and 4th-level wizard.</p><p>Mating occurs at any time of year. The female bears a litter of one to three cubs in ten months. The cubs are born with a camouflage pattern of black spots; these fade within two months. Wemic cubs are playful and curious; they possess few instincts and thus must learn everything. Cubs are born with 1 HD and gain 2 HD each year. They reach maturity at age 3.</p><p>Wemics have human-level intelligence. They possess a Stone age culture, using fire and possessing modest manufacturing skills with which they can create stone weaponry, pottery, and ornaments. They can be taught more complex skills. They are excellent trackers and guides. They may hire out their services in exchange for treasure and tools, such as weapons and magical items. They may also charge travelers a toll for safe passage through their nation's territory.</p><br clear=\"all\" style=\"clear:both; height:0;\">\r\n","images":["<img src=\"grf/xx.gif\" width=\"150\" height=\"75\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Advanced Dungeons & Dragons 2nd Edition\" title=\"Advanced Dungeons & Dragons 2nd Edition\" align=\"right\">","<img src=\"img/wemic.gif\" alt=\"Wemic\" title=\"Wemic\" border=\"0\" width=\"300\" height=\"360\" style=\"text-align:right;\" align=\"right\">","<img src=\"grf/tsr_sm.png\" width=\"56\" height=\"59\" border=\"0\" alt=\"TSR\">"],"setting":"Advanced Dungeons & Dragons 2nd Edition","statblock":{"Wemic":{"Activity Cycle":"Day","Alignment":"Neutral","Armor Class":"Males 6 (5), females 7","Climate/Terrain":"Temperate plains","Damage/Attack":"1-4/1-4 and weapon","Diet":"Carnivore","Frequency":"Very rare","Hit Dice":"5+8","Intelligence":"Average (8-10)","Magic Resistance":"Nil","Morale":"Steady (11-12)","Movement":"12","No. Appearing":"2-16","No. of Attacks":"2 or 3","Organization":"Prides","Size":"L (7')","Special Attacks":"Nil","Special Defenses":"-2 initiative modifier","THAC0":"15","Treasure":"B","XP Value":"Normal: 270<br>Chief/Chieftain: 420<br>Witch Doctor/King: 975"}},"title":"Wemic"},"sources":["2140"],"statblock_names":[],"title":"Wemic","prev_key":"weisshun","next_key":"weredrag","monster_path":"/appendix/wemic"}},"staticQueryHashes":[],"slicesMap":{}}
