While the powers listed above are the most common, some aarakocra have different or additional powers.</p><p class=\"f\">A race of intelligent, birdlike creatures living in the deepest deserts of Athas, the rare Athasian <a href=\"/appendix/aarakocr\">aarakocra</a> spends its time soaring on thermals in search of food.</p><p>The aarakocra is 7 to 8 feet tall with a wingspan of 20 feet or more. Because of its large wingspan, an aarakocra can carry as much as 75% of its own body weight and still fly easily. An aarakocra can fly a short distance carrying a burden equaling 125% of its own body weight. The average body weight of a full grown male is 100 pounds and a female is 85 pounds.</p><p>Each wing has a &ldquo;hand&rdquo; at its midpoint, consisting of three fingers and an opposable thumb. The fourth finger forms the rigid leading edge of the wing. In flight the hands cannot be used, but on the ground the aarakocra can use its hands almost as a human would. The aarakocra's body is protected by a thin bony plate on the chest, much like a solid rib cage. Talons on its legs can be used as claws and can be retracted to reveal a second set of hands, also with three fingers and an opposable thumb. Except for the chest plate, the entire skeleton is hollow and extremely fragile.</p><p>From a distance, the Athasian aarakocra resembles a huge <a href=\"/appendix/bird\">vulture</a>. Its black eyes, set in the front of the head, provide excellent vision over a long range. The plumage is generally black with a white collar for adult males and black or brown with a smaller white collar for females. Adolescents are a mixture of brown and black. The beak is large and covers most of the head. Plumage begins at the crown of the head and is darker near the head, except for the collar. Athasian aarakocra speak their own language and the languages of vultures and other large birds. Some speak the common tongue (5% to 10% chance depending on how deep in the wastelands a tribe lives).</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Combat:</b> Aarakocra can fight in the air or on the ground. They prefer aerial combat since their bones are too fragile to withstand a solid blow from a human-sized opponent. In combat against creatures on the ground, they prefer to fly over their victim and drop weighted nets. Some aarakocra use darts to harass ground-based opponents.</p><p>If their opponents can fly, the aarakocra generally forgo the use of the net, although large groups sometimes use nets on flying creatures. Normally, aarakocra attack flying creatures with long spears, diving from above and allowing the momentum to carry the spear through the target. Such an attack doubles the damage if the aarakocra have been able to dive at least 50 feet. Only the very largest aarakocra can carry more than one of these spears, they can attack with both at once with no penalty, causing double damage on each strike. All diving attacks are made at +4 and should be treated as a charge attack. All other penalties and restrictions of charge attacks apply.</p><p>The effect of the aarakocra's nets depends on if the opponent is flying at the time it becomes entangled. Creatures on the ground that are hit by a net are entangled and unable to participate in any combat until they make a successful Strength check to get free of the net. Flying creatures hit by a net can no longer fly and immediately begin falling. If they cannot escape the net or use some magical means to arrest the fall, normal falling damage applies.</p><p>Unless victims are entangled in nets, aarakocra are cautious in ground combat. If the aarakocra outnumber their opponents they advance in a straight line and thrust with their spears. If outnumbered, or the opponents are particularly tough, the aarakocra withdraw. Victims entangled in nets are killed or incapacitated for use as food or ransom.</p><p>Athasian aarakocra are mindful of their physical limitations as well as their comparatively low psionic abilities. They do not normally initiate psionic combat. At the first sign of psionic powers from any of their victims, however, all aarakocra that have some ability will use whatever attack and defense modes they can in an attempt to destroy the threat. Large groups of is or more aarakocra may initiate psionic combat if their leaders feel they can win quickly and avoid physical combat.</p><p>In desperation, an aarakocra can attempt to bite an opponent in combat. Because of the unwieldiness of its beak, the aarakocra has a THAC0 of 18 if attacking with this appendage. Further, the birdman causes only 1d2 points of damage with the beak.</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Habitat/Society:</b> Athasian aarakocra live in tribes with 6-20 (2d8+4) members, depending on the prestige of the leader. The largest tribe ever recorded had 50 members. The tribal hunting territory depends on the size of the tribe, usually about 500 square miles for a tribe of 10 members. There are no rigid boundaries between tribes and border disputes are not uncommon.</p><p>Alignments of tribe members are similar to the alignment of the leader. A tribe that has a leader who is neutral good may have neutral good, chaotic good, lawful good, and true neutral members. A predominantly evil tribe does not recognize boundaries with other tribes and treats other tribes as inferior beings to be eliminated.</p><p>Athasian aarakocra aren't happy in enclosed spaces, but they they take refuge in a cave or building if necessary.</p><p>Nonevil tribes live in rocky aeries in the highest peaks they can find. Evil tribes are normally nomadic and use an aerie made by another tribe if they need to remain in an area for a long time, even if they have to evict the tribe that made the nest.</p><p>Aarakocra aren't friendly toward intruders in their territory, especially caravans. They try to extract a toll from the caravan for passage through the desert. Good-aligned tribes allow unhindered passage of caravans that pay a tribute. If someone refuses to pay the tribute, the aarakocra try to capture scouts or outriders from the party and hold them until an even larger tribute is paid. The payment may be either livestock or shiny objects. Aarakocra are smart enough not to be taken in by glass baubles instead of gems, although they cannot tell the difference between the more common gems and the rare ones.</p><p>Evil tribes ask for tribute and often attack a caravan whether it pays or not. Aarakocra always demand shiny objects such as stones. These tribes find humans and demihumans to be quite tasty and prefer them to other food.</p><p>Good-aligned tribes of aarakocra sometimes return a lost traveler to the edge of the desert after first removing any valuables the traveler may be carrying. On very rare occasions a tribe might return a lost group of travelers to the more frequently traveled parts of the desert, again after first taking any valuables as payment.</p><p>The oldest male is the leader of the tribal hunting party and has 4+4 Hit Dice. The oldest female is in charge of the tribal aerie and has 3+3 HD. In tribes that have more than 15 members, the next oldest aarakocra serves as shaman and has 3+3 HD; the shaman completes the triumvirate necessary for proper worship and the summoning of elementals. (Interestingly, no magic-using aarakocra has ever been recorded.) Tribes without a shaman cannot summon <a href=\"/appendix/element1\">air elementals</a>, which is an important part of aarakocra culture.</p><p>The shaman is the leader of the daily sun worship. Aarakocra worship the sun because it provides them with the thermals they need to soar in search of food. The shaman also leads the mystic rituals used to summon an air elemental. Summoning an air elemental is usually done only in preparation for the tribe's most sacred ceremony, the hunt. Small tribes must band together for this ceremony to allow the triumvirate to be formed.</p><p>The ceremony to summon an air elemental must be conducted at dawn and requires the oldest male and female to emit a highpitched keening whistle. The shaman conducts an intricate dance around them, simultaneously chanting an ancient summoning mantra.</p><p>The hunt is the final part of the initiation of adolescent aarakocra to adulthood and often takes the tribe far from their normal teritory. The target is always a <a href=\"/appendix/drakalsi\">silt drake</a>. The hunt is the only time the females leave the relative safety of the nest. Even an evil tribe will not interfere with a tribe on a hunt. An air elemental is often summoned to help find the drake, but never takes part in the actual combat. Although the adult members of the tribe take part in the initial phases of the combat, it is the initiates who deliver the final, killing blows to me drake. Scars from the hunt are considered a mark of pride among all aarakocra.</p><p>The females spend about eight months of the year incubating their eggs. Athasian aarakocra mate for life and a pair normally produces as many as 10 offspring. A female lays one egg a year. Constant incubation is not required because of the high daytime temperatures, so the females can maintain the nest and keep the tribe's treasure in order.</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Ecology:</b> Athasian aarakocra are high on the food chain and have no natural enemies other than <a href=\"/appendix/drakatha\">drakes</a>. Unless evil, aarakocra leave their own territory only to hunt the silt drake and return as soon as possible when the hunt is over. (Evil aarakocra attack others, as noted above.) Aarakocra eggs and hatchlings are sought after by wealthy land owners who wish to use the creatures as scouts and sentries. An egg can bring as much as 10 cp in Tyr's marketplace. Tribes that have had eggs or hatchlings stolen have long memories and sometimes take revenge against the thief at a later date. Captive aarakocra join any tribe they come in contact with.</p><p>Athasian aarakocra have a natural life span of 21-30 years.</p><br clear=\"all\" style=\"clear:both; height:0;\">\r\n","images":["<img src=\"grf/ds.gif\" width=\"150\" height=\"75\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Dark Sun\" title=\"Dark Sun\" align=\"right\">","<img src=\"img/aarakath.gif\" alt=\"Aarakocra (Athas)\" title=\"Aarakocra (Athas)\" border=\"0\" width=\"300\" height=\"360\" style=\"text-align:right;\" align=\"right\">","<img src=\"grf/add2_01.gif\" width=\"200\" height=\"56\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Advanced Dungeons & Dragons 2nd Edition\">"],"setting":"Dark Sun","statblock":{"Aarakocra (Athas)":{"Activity Cycle":"Day","Alignment":"Any","Armor Class":"7","Climate/Terrain":"Deep desert","Damage/Attack":"1d3/1d3 or by weapon","Diet":"Carnivore","Frequency":"Rare","Hit Dice":"2+2","Intelligence":"Average (8-10)","Magic Resistance":"Nil","Morale":"Steady (11)","Movement":"6, Fl 36 (C)","No. Appearing":"1d10","No. of Attacks":"2","Organization":"Tribal","Size":"M (20'+ wingspan)","Special Attacks":"Nil","Special Defenses":"Nil","THAC0":"17","Treasure":"Varies","XP Value":"65"}},"title":"Aarakocra (Athas)"},"sources":["2433"],"statblock_names":[],"title":"Aarakocra (Athas)","prev_key":"zygraat","next_key":"aarakocr","monster_path":"/appendix/aarakath"}}},"pageContext":{"monster_key":"behoobse","monster_data":{"TSR":["2613"],"fullBody":"  <table cellspacing=\"0\" cellpadding=\"0\"><tr><th>Climate/Terrain:</th><td>Acheron, Mechanus, Outlands</td></tr><tr><th>Frequency:</th><td>Very rare</td></tr><tr><th>Organization:</th><td>Solitary</td></tr><tr><th>Activity Cycle:</th><td>Any</td></tr><tr><th>Diet:</th><td>Carnivore</td></tr><tr><th>Intelligence:</th><td>Genius (17-18)</td></tr><tr><th>Treasure:</th><td>E,R,T</td></tr><tr><th>Alignment:</th><td>Lawful neutral (evil)</td></tr><tr><th>No. Appearing:</th><td>1</td></tr><tr><th>Armor Class:</th><td>-2 (body)/2 (eyestalks)</td></tr><tr><th>Movement:</th><td>Fl 3 (A)</td></tr><tr><th>Hit Dice:</th><td>8+8</td></tr><tr><th>THAC0:</th><td>9</td></tr><tr><th>No. of Attacks:</th><td>3</td></tr><tr><th>Damage/Attack:</th><td>1d8/1d8/1d8</td></tr><tr><th>Special Attacks:</th><td>Blood drain, gaze, psionics</td></tr><tr><th>Special Defenses:</th><td>Nil</td></tr><tr><th>Magic Resistance:</th><td>25%</td></tr><tr><th>Size:</th><td>L (6' diameter)</td></tr><tr><th>Morale:</th><td>Champion (15-16)</td></tr><tr><th>XP Value:</th><td>15,000</td></tr></table><p class=\"f\"><b>Psionics Summary</b></p><table class=\"ip\"><tr class=\"bk\"><th>Level</th><th>Dis/Sci/Dev</th><th>Attack/Defense</th><th>Score</th><th>PSPs</th></tr><tr class=\"cn\"><td>10</td><td>4/5/15</td><td>All/All</td><td>16</td><td>230</td></tr></table><p class=\"ni\"><b>Psychokinesis -</b> <i>Science:</i> telekinesis; <i>Devotions:</i> animate object, inertial barrier.</p><p class=\"ni\"><b>Psychometabolism -</b> <i>Sciences:</i> nil; <i>Devotions:</i> body control, cause decay, chameleon power, double pain.</p><p class=\"ni\"><b>Telepathy -</b> <i>Sciences:</i> domination, mind link, probe; <i>Devotions:</i> attraction, aversion, contact, ESP, invisibility, mind bar, phobia amplification.</p><p class=\"ni\"><b>Metapsionics -</b> <i>Science:</i> psychic surgery; <i>Devotions:</i> psionic sense, psionic drain.</p><p class=\"f\">Primes always seem surprised to learn that there are observers that lair on the Outlands and lawful planes, but it only stands to reason that a monster so widespread as the <a href=\"/appendix/beholde1\">beholder</a> would've spawned planar offspring. Observers are a lot like the other beholder-kin, concealing a frightening alien intelligence and fearsome magical powers behind a chitinous body. Unlike their more rapacious prime-material kin, observers adhere to a cool neutrality and are often content to leave well enough alone. ('Course, that doesn't help the Clueless sod who attacks one of these things, taking it to be a beholder.)</p><p>An observer has a spherical body about 6 to 7 feet in diameter, covered with a tough, chitinous shell. The shell's a mottled purple and pinkish color, and can be 2 to 3 inches thick in places. Unlike beholders, observers have three mouths spaced evenly around their lower hemisphere, and three main eyes spaced evenly around their equator. Six minor eyes on stalks ring their dorsal surfaces. Observers support their bodies by means of an innate <i>levitation</i> ability.</p><p>Observers often create small empires or tyrannies, using their magical and psionic abilities to take control of regions and order them to their own will. Observers are generally more passive than their beholder cousins, and fight only when directly attacked. Unless it's physically threatened, an observer's usually content to use negotiation and manipulation to achieve its ends.</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Combat:</b> The observer's main body is AC -2, but its mouths, main eyes, and eyestalks are not as well-armored; they're only AC 2. The loss of these organs doesn't count against the obewer's own hit points. The main eyes can withstand 10 points of damage each, the eyestalks 5 points of damage, and the mouths 15 points of damage before being destroyed.</p><p>The observer's mouths actually consist of powerful, reractable stalks that can reach things up to 5 feet from the main body. If the observer's mouth hits with a roll 4 or more greater than the attack roll needed, it fastens to the victim and begins to drain blood at the rate of 2 hit points per round. When possible, the observer will divide its attacks to drair as nany victims as it can.</p><p>Although the observer's attacks are formidable, they pale in comparison to its magical abilities. Each of the creature's main eyes projects a powerhl ray of telekinetic force that can have one of three effects: First, it can simulate <i>Bigby's forceful hand</i>, driving back one creature at the rate of 20 feet per round. Creatures weighing up to 500 pounds can be so affected, and creatures between 500 and 1,000 pounds cannot advance closer to the observer while its gaze remains on them. Creatures over 1,000 pounds can advance only at the speed of 10 feet per round. Second, the gaze of the main eyes can be used to strike telekinetic blows inflicting damage equal to 1d12 points plus the victim's AC. Third, it can automatically deflect all physical missiles fired at the creature from the 120 degree arc in front of the eye. The main eyes have a range of 100 yards.</p><p>Each of the six smaller eyes can create the following effects against a single target:</p><ul><li><i>domination</i> (30-yard range)</li><li><i>enervation</i> (30-yard range)</li><li><i>fear</i> (50-yard range)</li><li><i>finger of death</i> (30-yard range)</li><li><i>magic missile</i> (3 missiles, 50-yard range)</li><li><i>Otiluke's freezing sphere</i> (cold ray inflicts 8d4+16 points of damage)</li></ul><p>The powerful eyes of observers are the equivalent of a <i>true seeing</i> spell to a range of 100 yards, except that the monster can't determine alignment by sight. This means they can't be deceived by <i>illusions</i> or invisibility.</p><p>As if these weren't enough to lay any sod in the deadlook, observers are also powerful psionicists, in possession of potent telepathic and psychokinetic abilities. An observer usually relies on its magical abilities first, but should those fail or a subtler means of attack be required, it'll fall back on mental attacks. Observers enjoy experimenting with telepathic attacks against nonpsionic creatures and take a fiendish pleasure in permanently wrecking a foolish opponent's psyche.</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Habitat/Society:</b> Fortunately, observers aren't social creatures. They can't stand each other and avoid contact with others of their kind. It's rare for observers' rivalries to break out into open conflict, but it's not unheard of. Unlike the xenophobia that forms the basis of prime-material beholders' conflicts, territoriality and fierce competition for the same resources are the main sources of friction between observers.</p><p>Observers divide their time between maintaining a realm ordered to their exacting specifications and wandering the cosmos in search of knowledge and power necessary to expand their domains. When an observer's abroad on the planes, it's far more passive and less likely to attack cutters who have something it wants (That's why they call it an observer, berk.) However, its attitude changes once it's back on its own home turf. Patience and tolerance have no places in the observer's territory, and it ruthlessly attacks and eliminates competititors or intruders.</p><p>So, what's an observer's domain like? Observers have a strange, alien set of values and ideals. They'll dominate or psionically alter any living thing in their territory to make it their slave. This means that an observer in its home is likely to be defended by a small army of mind-wiped minions. The creature is also fascinated by wealth and spends much of its time encouraging its slaves to add to its hoard. Despite this, it's not necessarily interested in malice for its own sake - it's just supremely selfish and paranoid.</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Ecology:</b> Observers are near the top of the food chain anywhere they go. Only the most powerful fiends can defeat an eye tyrant. Observers are hoarders of arcane objects and knowledge, and can be an excellent source of information if a cutter's willing to risk dealing with one.She'll need to be able to offer the monster something it wants in exchange for any darks she wants the observer to part with; observers don't give anything away for free.</p><p>It's not known how observers reproduce, but some cutters've speculated that observers spawn by selecting one of their slaves to carry a parasitic egg. The young observer devours its host from the inside out before emerging to contest its parent's dominion. The parent drives the young creature out of its territory and ignores it from that point on.</p><br clear=\"all\" style=\"clear:both; height:0;\">\r\n","images":["<img src=\"grf/ps.gif\" width=\"150\" height=\"75\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Planescape\" title=\"Planescape\" align=\"right\">","<img src=\"img/behoobse.gif\" alt=\"Beholder-kin, Observer\" title=\"Beholder-kin, Observer\" border=\"0\" width=\"300\" height=\"360\" style=\"text-align:right;\" align=\"right\">","<img src=\"grf/beh.gif\" width=\"59\" height=\"57\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Beholder\">"],"setting":"Planescape","statblock":{"Beholder-kin, Observer":{"Activity Cycle":"Any","Alignment":"Lawful neutral (evil)","Armor Class":"-2 (body)/2 (eyestalks)","Climate/Terrain":"Acheron, Mechanus, Outlands","Damage/Attack":"1d8/1d8/1d8","Diet":"Carnivore","Frequency":"Very rare","Hit Dice":"8+8","Intelligence":"Genius (17-18)","Magic Resistance":"25%","Morale":"Champion (15-16)","Movement":"Fl 3 (A)","No. Appearing":"1","No. of Attacks":"3","Organization":"Solitary","Size":"L (6' diameter)","Special Attacks":"Blood drain, gaze, psionics","Special Defenses":"Nil","THAC0":"9","Treasure":"E,R,T","XP Value":"15,000"}},"title":"Beholder-kin, Observer"},"sources":["2613"],"statblock_names":[],"title":"Beholder-kin, Observer","prev_key":"beholde2","next_key":"behundea","monster_path":"/appendix/behoobse"}},"staticQueryHashes":[],"slicesMap":{}}
