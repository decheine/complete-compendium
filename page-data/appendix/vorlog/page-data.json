While the powers listed above are the most common, some aarakocra have different or additional powers.</p><p class=\"f\">A race of intelligent, birdlike creatures living in the deepest deserts of Athas, the rare Athasian <a href=\"/appendix/aarakocr\">aarakocra</a> spends its time soaring on thermals in search of food.</p><p>The aarakocra is 7 to 8 feet tall with a wingspan of 20 feet or more. Because of its large wingspan, an aarakocra can carry as much as 75% of its own body weight and still fly easily. An aarakocra can fly a short distance carrying a burden equaling 125% of its own body weight. The average body weight of a full grown male is 100 pounds and a female is 85 pounds.</p><p>Each wing has a &ldquo;hand&rdquo; at its midpoint, consisting of three fingers and an opposable thumb. The fourth finger forms the rigid leading edge of the wing. In flight the hands cannot be used, but on the ground the aarakocra can use its hands almost as a human would. The aarakocra's body is protected by a thin bony plate on the chest, much like a solid rib cage. Talons on its legs can be used as claws and can be retracted to reveal a second set of hands, also with three fingers and an opposable thumb. Except for the chest plate, the entire skeleton is hollow and extremely fragile.</p><p>From a distance, the Athasian aarakocra resembles a huge <a href=\"/appendix/bird\">vulture</a>. Its black eyes, set in the front of the head, provide excellent vision over a long range. The plumage is generally black with a white collar for adult males and black or brown with a smaller white collar for females. Adolescents are a mixture of brown and black. The beak is large and covers most of the head. Plumage begins at the crown of the head and is darker near the head, except for the collar. Athasian aarakocra speak their own language and the languages of vultures and other large birds. Some speak the common tongue (5% to 10% chance depending on how deep in the wastelands a tribe lives).</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Combat:</b> Aarakocra can fight in the air or on the ground. They prefer aerial combat since their bones are too fragile to withstand a solid blow from a human-sized opponent. In combat against creatures on the ground, they prefer to fly over their victim and drop weighted nets. Some aarakocra use darts to harass ground-based opponents.</p><p>If their opponents can fly, the aarakocra generally forgo the use of the net, although large groups sometimes use nets on flying creatures. Normally, aarakocra attack flying creatures with long spears, diving from above and allowing the momentum to carry the spear through the target. Such an attack doubles the damage if the aarakocra have been able to dive at least 50 feet. Only the very largest aarakocra can carry more than one of these spears, they can attack with both at once with no penalty, causing double damage on each strike. All diving attacks are made at +4 and should be treated as a charge attack. All other penalties and restrictions of charge attacks apply.</p><p>The effect of the aarakocra's nets depends on if the opponent is flying at the time it becomes entangled. Creatures on the ground that are hit by a net are entangled and unable to participate in any combat until they make a successful Strength check to get free of the net. Flying creatures hit by a net can no longer fly and immediately begin falling. If they cannot escape the net or use some magical means to arrest the fall, normal falling damage applies.</p><p>Unless victims are entangled in nets, aarakocra are cautious in ground combat. If the aarakocra outnumber their opponents they advance in a straight line and thrust with their spears. If outnumbered, or the opponents are particularly tough, the aarakocra withdraw. Victims entangled in nets are killed or incapacitated for use as food or ransom.</p><p>Athasian aarakocra are mindful of their physical limitations as well as their comparatively low psionic abilities. They do not normally initiate psionic combat. At the first sign of psionic powers from any of their victims, however, all aarakocra that have some ability will use whatever attack and defense modes they can in an attempt to destroy the threat. Large groups of is or more aarakocra may initiate psionic combat if their leaders feel they can win quickly and avoid physical combat.</p><p>In desperation, an aarakocra can attempt to bite an opponent in combat. Because of the unwieldiness of its beak, the aarakocra has a THAC0 of 18 if attacking with this appendage. Further, the birdman causes only 1d2 points of damage with the beak.</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Habitat/Society:</b> Athasian aarakocra live in tribes with 6-20 (2d8+4) members, depending on the prestige of the leader. The largest tribe ever recorded had 50 members. The tribal hunting territory depends on the size of the tribe, usually about 500 square miles for a tribe of 10 members. There are no rigid boundaries between tribes and border disputes are not uncommon.</p><p>Alignments of tribe members are similar to the alignment of the leader. A tribe that has a leader who is neutral good may have neutral good, chaotic good, lawful good, and true neutral members. A predominantly evil tribe does not recognize boundaries with other tribes and treats other tribes as inferior beings to be eliminated.</p><p>Athasian aarakocra aren't happy in enclosed spaces, but they they take refuge in a cave or building if necessary.</p><p>Nonevil tribes live in rocky aeries in the highest peaks they can find. Evil tribes are normally nomadic and use an aerie made by another tribe if they need to remain in an area for a long time, even if they have to evict the tribe that made the nest.</p><p>Aarakocra aren't friendly toward intruders in their territory, especially caravans. They try to extract a toll from the caravan for passage through the desert. Good-aligned tribes allow unhindered passage of caravans that pay a tribute. If someone refuses to pay the tribute, the aarakocra try to capture scouts or outriders from the party and hold them until an even larger tribute is paid. The payment may be either livestock or shiny objects. Aarakocra are smart enough not to be taken in by glass baubles instead of gems, although they cannot tell the difference between the more common gems and the rare ones.</p><p>Evil tribes ask for tribute and often attack a caravan whether it pays or not. Aarakocra always demand shiny objects such as stones. These tribes find humans and demihumans to be quite tasty and prefer them to other food.</p><p>Good-aligned tribes of aarakocra sometimes return a lost traveler to the edge of the desert after first removing any valuables the traveler may be carrying. On very rare occasions a tribe might return a lost group of travelers to the more frequently traveled parts of the desert, again after first taking any valuables as payment.</p><p>The oldest male is the leader of the tribal hunting party and has 4+4 Hit Dice. The oldest female is in charge of the tribal aerie and has 3+3 HD. In tribes that have more than 15 members, the next oldest aarakocra serves as shaman and has 3+3 HD; the shaman completes the triumvirate necessary for proper worship and the summoning of elementals. (Interestingly, no magic-using aarakocra has ever been recorded.) Tribes without a shaman cannot summon <a href=\"/appendix/element1\">air elementals</a>, which is an important part of aarakocra culture.</p><p>The shaman is the leader of the daily sun worship. Aarakocra worship the sun because it provides them with the thermals they need to soar in search of food. The shaman also leads the mystic rituals used to summon an air elemental. Summoning an air elemental is usually done only in preparation for the tribe's most sacred ceremony, the hunt. Small tribes must band together for this ceremony to allow the triumvirate to be formed.</p><p>The ceremony to summon an air elemental must be conducted at dawn and requires the oldest male and female to emit a highpitched keening whistle. The shaman conducts an intricate dance around them, simultaneously chanting an ancient summoning mantra.</p><p>The hunt is the final part of the initiation of adolescent aarakocra to adulthood and often takes the tribe far from their normal teritory. The target is always a <a href=\"/appendix/drakalsi\">silt drake</a>. The hunt is the only time the females leave the relative safety of the nest. Even an evil tribe will not interfere with a tribe on a hunt. An air elemental is often summoned to help find the drake, but never takes part in the actual combat. Although the adult members of the tribe take part in the initial phases of the combat, it is the initiates who deliver the final, killing blows to me drake. Scars from the hunt are considered a mark of pride among all aarakocra.</p><p>The females spend about eight months of the year incubating their eggs. Athasian aarakocra mate for life and a pair normally produces as many as 10 offspring. A female lays one egg a year. Constant incubation is not required because of the high daytime temperatures, so the females can maintain the nest and keep the tribe's treasure in order.</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Ecology:</b> Athasian aarakocra are high on the food chain and have no natural enemies other than <a href=\"/appendix/drakatha\">drakes</a>. Unless evil, aarakocra leave their own territory only to hunt the silt drake and return as soon as possible when the hunt is over. (Evil aarakocra attack others, as noted above.) Aarakocra eggs and hatchlings are sought after by wealthy land owners who wish to use the creatures as scouts and sentries. An egg can bring as much as 10 cp in Tyr's marketplace. Tribes that have had eggs or hatchlings stolen have long memories and sometimes take revenge against the thief at a later date. Captive aarakocra join any tribe they come in contact with.</p><p>Athasian aarakocra have a natural life span of 21-30 years.</p><br clear=\"all\" style=\"clear:both; height:0;\">\r\n","images":["<img src=\"grf/ds.gif\" width=\"150\" height=\"75\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Dark Sun\" title=\"Dark Sun\" align=\"right\">","<img src=\"img/aarakath.gif\" alt=\"Aarakocra (Athas)\" title=\"Aarakocra (Athas)\" border=\"0\" width=\"300\" height=\"360\" style=\"text-align:right;\" align=\"right\">","<img src=\"grf/add2_01.gif\" width=\"200\" height=\"56\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Advanced Dungeons & Dragons 2nd Edition\">"],"setting":"Dark Sun","statblock":{"Aarakocra (Athas)":{"Activity Cycle":"Day","Alignment":"Any","Armor Class":"7","Climate/Terrain":"Deep desert","Damage/Attack":"1d3/1d3 or by weapon","Diet":"Carnivore","Frequency":"Rare","Hit Dice":"2+2","Intelligence":"Average (8-10)","Magic Resistance":"Nil","Morale":"Steady (11)","Movement":"6, Fl 36 (C)","No. Appearing":"1d10","No. of Attacks":"2","Organization":"Tribal","Size":"M (20'+ wingspan)","Special Attacks":"Nil","Special Defenses":"Nil","THAC0":"17","Treasure":"Varies","XP Value":"65"}},"title":"Aarakocra (Athas)"},"sources":["2433"],"statblock_names":[],"title":"Aarakocra (Athas)","prev_key":"zygraat","next_key":"aarakocr","monster_path":"/appendix/aarakath"}}},"pageContext":{"monster_key":"vorlog","monster_data":{"TSR":["2153"],"fullBody":"  <table cellspacing=\"0\" cellpadding=\"0\"><tr><th>Climate/Terrain:</th><td>Any land</td></tr><tr><th>Frequency:</th><td>Very rare</td></tr><tr><th>Organization:</th><td>Solitary</td></tr><tr><th>Activity Cycle:</th><td>Night</td></tr><tr><th>Diet:</th><td>Special</td></tr><tr><th>Intelligence:</th><td>High (13-14)</td></tr><tr><th>Treasure:</th><td>C</td></tr><tr><th>Alignment:</th><td>Chaotic evil</td></tr><tr><th>No. Appearing:</th><td>1</td></tr><tr><th>Armor Class:</th><td>3</td></tr><tr><th>Movement:</th><td>12</td></tr><tr><th>Hit Dice:</th><td>6</td></tr><tr><th>THAC0:</th><td>15</td></tr><tr><th>No. of Attacks:</th><td>1</td></tr><tr><th>Damage/Attack:</th><td>5-10</td></tr><tr><th>Special Attacks:</th><td><i>Charm</i>, sap Wisdom</td></tr><tr><th>Special Defenses:</th><td>+1 weapon to hit; immune to poison, <i>sleep</i>, <i>charm</i>, and <i>hold</i> spells; regeneration</td></tr><tr><th>Magic Resistance:</th><td>Nil</td></tr><tr><th>Size:</th><td>M (5-6' tall)</td></tr><tr><th>Morale:</th><td>Steady (11)</td></tr><tr><th>XP Value:</th><td>3,000</td></tr></table><p class=\"f\">One of a <a href=\"/appendix/vampire\">vampire's</a> most vulnerable moments is when the evil creature is attempting to complete its <i>dark kiss</i>, its bonding with a new vampire companion, creating a vampiric &ldquo;bride&rdquo; or &ldquo;groom&rdquo;. As elaborated upon by Doctor Rudolph van Richten in his great treatise on vampires, the process of creating a vampire bride or groom is quite elaborate, involving a great expenditure of both passion and blood on the part of the monster. For approximately one hour after the monster has poured all of its energy into the erstwhile companion, the vampire lies helpless beside the bride's or groom's transforming body. If the vampire is slain during this time period, its victim does not complete the transformation, but becomes a creature caught between the world of the living and that of the dead - a sorry being known as a vorlog.</p><p>Physically the vorlog appears no different from a normal human, save for the budding fangs visible when the monster speaks. A vorlog has pale skin and always wears an expression of terrible pain and longing on its ashen face. Although the vorlog casts a shadow (unlike a true vampire), the monster can be recognized by a careful observer who notes that the creature appears translucent in mirrors and makes no noise when it moves.</p><p>Vorlogs speak the languages they knew in life. Those who have existed for a long time may have acquired other tongues as well.</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Combat:</b> Vorlogs have the same raw physical strength as their vampiric creators. A vorlog enjoys a Strength score of 18/76 and thus receives a bonus of +2 on its attack rolls and +4 on its damage rolls. The blows of a vorlog's hands inflict 1d6+4 points of damage to opponents.</p><p>The vorlog also gains the ability to use <i>charm person</i>, although the vorlog's charm inevitably causes its victims to feel something more akin to pity and sympathy. Otherwise, the ability is identical to the 1st level wizard spell of the same name. The vorlog can charm at will, and often employs the power to convince its chosen victims to visit its lair.</p><p>Although it is incapable of draining energy (experience) levels, the vorlog taps into its victim's spiritual energies. Each time a vorlog strikes a character, the victim must make a saving throw vs. spell. Failure indicates the character loses 2 points of Wisdom. This loss is temporary, and the victim will regain Wisdom points at the rate of 1 per hour. Characters whose Wisdom scores fall below 3 become so dazed that they perceive the vorlog to be a powerful protector. Such characters desire nothing more than to rest in the supposed sanctuary of the vorlog's embrace.</p><p>The vorlog is not actually an undead creature, nor is it truly alive. Thus, neither spells that detect the undead nor spells that detect life will sense the vorlog. The vorlog cannot be turned by a cleric, either. However, as with a true vampire, the vorlog is unaffected by poison, <i>sleep</i>, <i>charm</i>, and <i>hold</i> spells. Furthermore, the vorlog is immune to normal weapons, being harmed only by those of +1 or greater enchantment.</p><p>Vorlogs are capable of regeneration. While this ability is much less potent than that of a vampire, it is still a useful defense. When resting, they regenerate at the rate of 1 hit point per hour. However, while in the company of a charmed <i>surrogate</i> (see below), vorlogs regenerate far more rapidly, at the rate of 1 point per melee round.</p><p>If a vorlog is reduced to 0 hit points, it issues a mournful wail and melts into a pool of its own tears. The vorlog then attempts to flee the area and return to its lair to recuperate. In this form, the vorlog can climb wails and seep through any crack, no matter how small. The vorlog cannot assume this form at will.</p><p>After eight hours of rest, the vorlog again assumes a human form. Unlike a vampire, the vorlog is capable of recuperating in any dark haven, yet it prefers the safety of its own lair.</p><p>A vorlog can, at will, touch the minds of any beast within 50 feet. The vorlog's mind is filled with such intense anguish and loss that mental contact drives animals into berserk rages. Affected animals either attempt to flee from the vorlog (50%) or violently attack the nearest creature (50%).</p><p>Garlic and holy water have no effect on a vorlog. A vorlog will not approach a character presenting a lawful good holy symbol with courage and conviction. Although it is a nocturnal creature, a vorlog is not destroyed by the sun's rays. Sunlight does, however, cause intense pain, and the vorlog suffers 1d6 points of damage per round of direct exposure. If reduced to 0 hit points by such contact, the vorlog immediately collapses into a pool of tears and seeks shelter from the sun's rays. If unable to do so, the creature quickly dehydrates and dies within 1d4 hours.</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Habitat/Society:</b> Vorlogs are often left alive by vampire hunters, for the creatures initially appear human. Many valiant hunters have falsely congratulated themselves for saving a poor wretch when they have actually condemned him to a semilife of eternal torment.</p><p>The focus of the vorlog's entire existence centers on its utter anguish and bereavement at the death of its vampire lover. The creature had already given itself over to the vampire, body and mind, when the newly wrought bonds were ripped away by the creature's sudden demise. The shattering combination of psychic and physical blows is so devastating that the creature can never truly recover. Instead, it spends its eternal existence attempting to recreate its lost companion.</p><p>A vorlog spends much of its time searching for humans who resemble - even in only a remote fashion - its vampiric creator. Once a vorlog fixates on a particular individual, the monster becomes more and more convinced that the person actually is the vampire, reincarnated or otherwise restored. This fixation becomes so powerful that the vorlog will attempt anything to have the object of its obsession.</p><p>Once the vorlog has captured or charmed the individual in question, it makes the new &ldquo;companion&rdquo; dress and act like the yearned-for vampire lover. The vorlog also exchanges a small amount of blood with its new companion for three consecutive running, attempting to re-create the original and satisfying bond. At this point, the companion becomes the vorlog's surrogate. The surrogate gains no advantages from this bonding, although the vorlog can regenerate faster (see &ldquo;Combat&rdquo;) while in the presence of a surrogate. The vorlog also feeds on its surrogate's Wisdom regularly, so that the poor thing never has more than half of his or her normal Wlsdom score at any time.</p><p>A vorlog can survive no more than three months without a surrogate to feed upon, and it is loathe to go for even a month without such a companion, as the loneliness of its existence is almost unbearable.</p><p>The vorlog can sense the location of its surrogate, no matter where he or she hides. Only an <i>amulet of proof against detection and location</i>, or a similar magical charm, can keep a vorlog from discovering its surrogate's whereabouts.</p><p>Over the course of a few weeks, or at most months, the vorlog grows dissatisfied with the hollow mockery of its original bonding. This dissatisfaction is inevitable, as no being can ever recreate the powerful relationship between the vorlog and its creator. The miserable creature grows bitter and anguished as it begins to restlessly search anew for its creator. Eventually, the creature finds a new object for its obsession, at which point the vorlog returns to its current surrogate and destroys him or her.</p><p>A vorlog is capable of bonding with only one surrogate at a time. It cannot create new vampires or even other vorlogs to ease the utter desolation of its existence.</p><p>Interestingly, when two or more vorlogs confront each other, they find no comfort in mutual commiseration or empathy. Instead, the creatures tend to f1y into rages and attack one another or their surrogates. Even if such a fight does not occur, the vorlogs spend the bulk of their energies comparing their dead vampire masters, with each vorlog insisting that its beloved was far superior. Such petty and pointless rivalries consume the vorlogs, causing them to remain distant from the only other beings that might truly understand the anguish of their own existence.</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Ecology:</b> Only a mortal in the final stages of the transformation into a vampiric bride or groom (see <i>Van Richten's Guide to to Vampires</i> - TSR product stock #9345) can ever become a vorlog. Other potential vampires merely recover or die as a result of the injuries inflicted upon them by their vampire attacker.</p><p>The vorlog must feed on both normal food and psychic energy to survive. The creature's body needs only one-tenth the amount of food it required while alive, and it can go months without being seriously affected by starvation. More important to the creature is the psychic energy it draws from its surrogates. Without such a surrogate, the vampire dies in three months.</p><p>The vorlog is a creature that was never meant to be. Caught on the razor's edge between life and undeath, the vorlog is trapped in a world of horror which no other being can truly understand. There is no known way to cure a vorlog; only death grants monster any the measure of release. The vorlog is a creature to be both pitied and feared.</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Surrogate</b></p>  <p class=\"ni\">Once bonded to a vorlog, a surrogate automatically becomes charmed by the creature. Once so affected, the pitiful minion is unable to escape its master's essence on its own. No additional saving throws or the like are possible unless an outsider interferes with the foul relationship.</p><p>While serving a vorlog, a surrogate serves as both a companion and a source of psychic sustenance. Thus, a surrogate never has more than a half-normal Wisdom rating, due to the constant draining of mental energy.</p><p>The bond between a surrogate and a vorlog is not particularly powerful. If the vorlog dies, the bond is broken and the former surrogate becomes <i>confused</i> (as per the wizard spell). The surrogate automatically recovers from this confusion in 1d4 weeks, or sooner if the creature is <i>blessed</i> at some point. The bond can also be broken by submerging the surrogate in holy water.</p><p>While the vorlog is alive and the surrogate is bound to it, the latter will do everything power to protect the former. Although often convinced that there is something terribly wrong with his or her sudden change in lifestyle and companion, the surrogate will usually decide that he or she is simply not worthy of the newfound love and that it is necessary to strive all the harder to embody the appearance and behavior the vorlog craves. Such is the terrible mental trap in which the vorlog ensnares its surrogates.</p><p>Except for their drops in Wisdom scores, surrogates maintain all the abilities and aptitudes they normally possess - they are mortal and can be killed as such. Surrogates receive only pain, confusion, and eventually death for their services to a vorlog lover. It is a terrible existence, but one from which there is at least some hope of escape, however small. A vorlog's only escape is death's final embrace.</p><p></p><br clear=\"all\" style=\"clear:both; height:0;\">\r\n","images":["<img src=\"grf/rv.gif\" width=\"150\" height=\"75\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Ravenloft\" title=\"Ravenloft\" align=\"right\">","<img src=\"img/vorlog.gif\" alt=\"Vorlog\" title=\"Vorlog\" border=\"0\" width=\"300\" height=\"360\" style=\"text-align:right;\" align=\"right\">","<img src=\"grf/add2_01.gif\" width=\"200\" height=\"56\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Advanced Dungeons & Dragons 2nd Edition\">"],"setting":"Ravenloft","statblock":{"Vorlog":{"Activity Cycle":"Night","Alignment":"Chaotic evil","Armor Class":"3","Climate/Terrain":"Any land","Damage/Attack":"5-10","Diet":"Special","Frequency":"Very rare","Hit Dice":"6","Intelligence":"High (13-14)","Magic Resistance":"Nil","Morale":"Steady (11)","Movement":"12","No. Appearing":"1","No. of Attacks":"1","Organization":"Solitary","Size":"M (5-6' tall)","Special Attacks":"<i>Charm</i>, sap Wisdom","Special Defenses":"+1 weapon to hit; immune to poison, <i>sleep</i>, <i>charm</i>, and <i>hold</i> spells; regeneration","THAC0":"15","Treasure":"C","XP Value":"3,000"}},"title":"Vorlog"},"sources":["2153"],"statblock_names":[],"title":"Vorlog","prev_key":"voreleki","next_key":"vorr","monster_path":"/appendix/vorlog"}},"staticQueryHashes":[],"slicesMap":{}}
