While the powers listed above are the most common, some aarakocra have different or additional powers.</p><p class=\"f\">A race of intelligent, birdlike creatures living in the deepest deserts of Athas, the rare Athasian <a href=\"/appendix/aarakocr\">aarakocra</a> spends its time soaring on thermals in search of food.</p><p>The aarakocra is 7 to 8 feet tall with a wingspan of 20 feet or more. Because of its large wingspan, an aarakocra can carry as much as 75% of its own body weight and still fly easily. An aarakocra can fly a short distance carrying a burden equaling 125% of its own body weight. The average body weight of a full grown male is 100 pounds and a female is 85 pounds.</p><p>Each wing has a &ldquo;hand&rdquo; at its midpoint, consisting of three fingers and an opposable thumb. The fourth finger forms the rigid leading edge of the wing. In flight the hands cannot be used, but on the ground the aarakocra can use its hands almost as a human would. The aarakocra's body is protected by a thin bony plate on the chest, much like a solid rib cage. Talons on its legs can be used as claws and can be retracted to reveal a second set of hands, also with three fingers and an opposable thumb. Except for the chest plate, the entire skeleton is hollow and extremely fragile.</p><p>From a distance, the Athasian aarakocra resembles a huge <a href=\"/appendix/bird\">vulture</a>. Its black eyes, set in the front of the head, provide excellent vision over a long range. The plumage is generally black with a white collar for adult males and black or brown with a smaller white collar for females. Adolescents are a mixture of brown and black. The beak is large and covers most of the head. Plumage begins at the crown of the head and is darker near the head, except for the collar. Athasian aarakocra speak their own language and the languages of vultures and other large birds. Some speak the common tongue (5% to 10% chance depending on how deep in the wastelands a tribe lives).</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Combat:</b> Aarakocra can fight in the air or on the ground. They prefer aerial combat since their bones are too fragile to withstand a solid blow from a human-sized opponent. In combat against creatures on the ground, they prefer to fly over their victim and drop weighted nets. Some aarakocra use darts to harass ground-based opponents.</p><p>If their opponents can fly, the aarakocra generally forgo the use of the net, although large groups sometimes use nets on flying creatures. Normally, aarakocra attack flying creatures with long spears, diving from above and allowing the momentum to carry the spear through the target. Such an attack doubles the damage if the aarakocra have been able to dive at least 50 feet. Only the very largest aarakocra can carry more than one of these spears, they can attack with both at once with no penalty, causing double damage on each strike. All diving attacks are made at +4 and should be treated as a charge attack. All other penalties and restrictions of charge attacks apply.</p><p>The effect of the aarakocra's nets depends on if the opponent is flying at the time it becomes entangled. Creatures on the ground that are hit by a net are entangled and unable to participate in any combat until they make a successful Strength check to get free of the net. Flying creatures hit by a net can no longer fly and immediately begin falling. If they cannot escape the net or use some magical means to arrest the fall, normal falling damage applies.</p><p>Unless victims are entangled in nets, aarakocra are cautious in ground combat. If the aarakocra outnumber their opponents they advance in a straight line and thrust with their spears. If outnumbered, or the opponents are particularly tough, the aarakocra withdraw. Victims entangled in nets are killed or incapacitated for use as food or ransom.</p><p>Athasian aarakocra are mindful of their physical limitations as well as their comparatively low psionic abilities. They do not normally initiate psionic combat. At the first sign of psionic powers from any of their victims, however, all aarakocra that have some ability will use whatever attack and defense modes they can in an attempt to destroy the threat. Large groups of is or more aarakocra may initiate psionic combat if their leaders feel they can win quickly and avoid physical combat.</p><p>In desperation, an aarakocra can attempt to bite an opponent in combat. Because of the unwieldiness of its beak, the aarakocra has a THAC0 of 18 if attacking with this appendage. Further, the birdman causes only 1d2 points of damage with the beak.</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Habitat/Society:</b> Athasian aarakocra live in tribes with 6-20 (2d8+4) members, depending on the prestige of the leader. The largest tribe ever recorded had 50 members. The tribal hunting territory depends on the size of the tribe, usually about 500 square miles for a tribe of 10 members. There are no rigid boundaries between tribes and border disputes are not uncommon.</p><p>Alignments of tribe members are similar to the alignment of the leader. A tribe that has a leader who is neutral good may have neutral good, chaotic good, lawful good, and true neutral members. A predominantly evil tribe does not recognize boundaries with other tribes and treats other tribes as inferior beings to be eliminated.</p><p>Athasian aarakocra aren't happy in enclosed spaces, but they they take refuge in a cave or building if necessary.</p><p>Nonevil tribes live in rocky aeries in the highest peaks they can find. Evil tribes are normally nomadic and use an aerie made by another tribe if they need to remain in an area for a long time, even if they have to evict the tribe that made the nest.</p><p>Aarakocra aren't friendly toward intruders in their territory, especially caravans. They try to extract a toll from the caravan for passage through the desert. Good-aligned tribes allow unhindered passage of caravans that pay a tribute. If someone refuses to pay the tribute, the aarakocra try to capture scouts or outriders from the party and hold them until an even larger tribute is paid. The payment may be either livestock or shiny objects. Aarakocra are smart enough not to be taken in by glass baubles instead of gems, although they cannot tell the difference between the more common gems and the rare ones.</p><p>Evil tribes ask for tribute and often attack a caravan whether it pays or not. Aarakocra always demand shiny objects such as stones. These tribes find humans and demihumans to be quite tasty and prefer them to other food.</p><p>Good-aligned tribes of aarakocra sometimes return a lost traveler to the edge of the desert after first removing any valuables the traveler may be carrying. On very rare occasions a tribe might return a lost group of travelers to the more frequently traveled parts of the desert, again after first taking any valuables as payment.</p><p>The oldest male is the leader of the tribal hunting party and has 4+4 Hit Dice. The oldest female is in charge of the tribal aerie and has 3+3 HD. In tribes that have more than 15 members, the next oldest aarakocra serves as shaman and has 3+3 HD; the shaman completes the triumvirate necessary for proper worship and the summoning of elementals. (Interestingly, no magic-using aarakocra has ever been recorded.) Tribes without a shaman cannot summon <a href=\"/appendix/element1\">air elementals</a>, which is an important part of aarakocra culture.</p><p>The shaman is the leader of the daily sun worship. Aarakocra worship the sun because it provides them with the thermals they need to soar in search of food. The shaman also leads the mystic rituals used to summon an air elemental. Summoning an air elemental is usually done only in preparation for the tribe's most sacred ceremony, the hunt. Small tribes must band together for this ceremony to allow the triumvirate to be formed.</p><p>The ceremony to summon an air elemental must be conducted at dawn and requires the oldest male and female to emit a highpitched keening whistle. The shaman conducts an intricate dance around them, simultaneously chanting an ancient summoning mantra.</p><p>The hunt is the final part of the initiation of adolescent aarakocra to adulthood and often takes the tribe far from their normal teritory. The target is always a <a href=\"/appendix/drakalsi\">silt drake</a>. The hunt is the only time the females leave the relative safety of the nest. Even an evil tribe will not interfere with a tribe on a hunt. An air elemental is often summoned to help find the drake, but never takes part in the actual combat. Although the adult members of the tribe take part in the initial phases of the combat, it is the initiates who deliver the final, killing blows to me drake. Scars from the hunt are considered a mark of pride among all aarakocra.</p><p>The females spend about eight months of the year incubating their eggs. Athasian aarakocra mate for life and a pair normally produces as many as 10 offspring. A female lays one egg a year. Constant incubation is not required because of the high daytime temperatures, so the females can maintain the nest and keep the tribe's treasure in order.</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Ecology:</b> Athasian aarakocra are high on the food chain and have no natural enemies other than <a href=\"/appendix/drakatha\">drakes</a>. Unless evil, aarakocra leave their own territory only to hunt the silt drake and return as soon as possible when the hunt is over. (Evil aarakocra attack others, as noted above.) Aarakocra eggs and hatchlings are sought after by wealthy land owners who wish to use the creatures as scouts and sentries. An egg can bring as much as 10 cp in Tyr's marketplace. Tribes that have had eggs or hatchlings stolen have long memories and sometimes take revenge against the thief at a later date. Captive aarakocra join any tribe they come in contact with.</p><p>Athasian aarakocra have a natural life span of 21-30 years.</p>\n","images":["<img src=\"grf/ds.gif\" width=\"150\" height=\"75\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Dark Sun\" title=\"Dark Sun\" align=\"right\">","<img src=\"img/aarakath.gif\" alt=\"Aarakocra (Athas)\" title=\"Aarakocra (Athas)\" border=\"0\" width=\"300\" height=\"360\" style=\"text-align:right;\" align=\"right\">","<img src=\"grf/add2_01.gif\" width=\"200\" height=\"56\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Advanced Dungeons & Dragons 2nd Edition\">"],"setting":"Dark Sun","statblock":{"Aarakocra (Athas)":{"Activity Cycle":"Day","Alignment":"Any","Armor Class":"7","Climate/Terrain":"Deep desert","Damage/Attack":"1d3/1d3 or by weapon","Diet":"Carnivore","Frequency":"Rare","Hit Dice":"2+2","Intelligence":"Average (8-10)","Magic Resistance":"Nil","Morale":"Steady (11)","Movement":"6, Fl 36 (C)","No. Appearing":"1d10","No. of Attacks":"2","Organization":"Tribal","Size":"M (20'+ wingspan)","Special Attacks":"Nil","Special Defenses":"Nil","THAC0":"17","Treasure":"Varies","XP Value":"65"}},"title":"Aarakocra (Athas)"},"sources":["2433"],"statblock_names":[],"title":"Aarakocra (Athas)","prev_key":"zygraat","next_key":"aarakocr","monster_path":"/appendix/aarakath"}}},"pageContext":{"monster_key":"kender","monster_data":{"TSR":["2105"],"fullBody":"  <table cellspacing=\"0\" cellpadding=\"0\"><tr><th>Climate/Terrain:</th><td>Tropical subtropical, and temperate/Plains, forests, jungles, hills, and mountains</td></tr><tr><th>Frequency:</th><td>Rare</td></tr><tr><th>Organization:</th><td>Family</td></tr><tr><th>Activity Cycle:</th><td>Any</td></tr><tr><th>Diet:</th><td>Omnivore</td></tr><tr><th>Intelligence:</th><td>Varies (6.18)</td></tr><tr><th>Treasure:</th><td>Varies (typical individual: O,X; typical lair: P,M,Q,X)</td></tr><tr><th>Alignment:</th><td>Varies, but usually lawful or chaotic neutral</td></tr><tr><th>No. Appearing:</th><td>1-20</td></tr><tr><th>Armor Class:</th><td>8 (10)</td></tr><tr><th>Movement:</th><td>6 (9)</td></tr><tr><th>Hit Dice:</th><td>1</td></tr><tr><th>THAC0:</th><td>19</td></tr><tr><th>No. of Attacks:</th><td>1</td></tr><tr><th>Damage/Attack:</th><td>1-6 or by weapon</td></tr><tr><th>Special Attacks:</th><td>See below</td></tr><tr><th>Special Defenses:</th><td>See below</td></tr><tr><th>Magic Resistance:</th><td>See below</td></tr><tr><th>Size:</th><td>S (3-4' tall)</td></tr><tr><th>Morale:</th><td>Fearless (20)</td></tr><tr><th>XP Value:</th><td>Varies</td></tr></table><p class=\"f\">Kender are diminutive humanoids who are insatiably curious and utterly fearless, with an uncanny knack for getting into trouble.</p><p>Kender resemble human children, though more heavily muscled. Males are typically 3'7&rdquo; tall and weigh 75 pounds; females are slightly smaller. Adult kender rarely exceed four feet tall or weigh more than 100 pounds. Kender have distinctive pointed ears that give them an elven appearance. They have sandy blonde, light brown, dark brown, copper-red, or red-orange hair, usually worn long with many varieties of braids and ponytails. Feathers, ribbons, flowers, and other colorful items are often woven into their hair. Kender are fair-skinned, but they tan quickly, becoming dark brown by mid-summer. Their eyes are variously pale blue, olive, light brown, and hazel.</p><p>Kender have been called wizened because of the fine network of lines that creases their faces beginning at age 40. Their facial expressions are quite intense; no one seems as happy as a joyful kender or as miserable as a weeping one.</p><p>Kender clothing varies widely, but tends to be colorful and bright. Soft leather is a particularly favored material for clothing, especially if dyed bright colors and tooled with designs. Kender carry a mind-boggling assortment of small items in their pockets and belt pouches, such as bird feathers, animal teeth, rings, string, handkerchiefs, small tools, pet mice, oddly shaped twigs, foreign coins, and bits of dried meat. Anything that conceivably could hold a kender's attention for more than a few seconds will likely find its way into his pocket, with or without the actual owners permission.</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Combat:</b> Kender fight hard and relentlessly, sometimes coming up with unexpected tactics that can carry the day for their companions. They are immune to all forms of fear, including magical fear, and make saving throws against spells and poison with a +4 bonus. When alone and not outfitted in armor, kender cause a -4 penalty to opponents' surprise rolls.</p><p>The kender's most effective defense is their ability to enrage opponents by taunting them with verbal abuse. Any creature taunted by a kender for one full round must roll a successful saving throw vs. spell or attack wildly for 1d10 rounds at a -2 penalty to attack rolls and a +2 penalty to Armor Class.</p><p>Kender employ a variety of weapons, and receive a +3 attack roll bonus when using slings or bows. Their favorite weapon is the hoopak, a special combination of a bo staff and staff sling. Made from resilient wood, one end of the hoopak is forked like a slingshot and has a leather pocket mounted between the forks. The other end is pointed and shod with metal or hardened by fire. When used as a sling, it causes 1d4 + 1 points of damage against small opponents and 1d6+1 points of damage against large opponents. When used as a staff, it causes 1d6 points of damage against small opponents and 1d4 points of damage against large opponents</p><p>Most kender do not tolerate armor any heavier than leather or padded. Some may use ring mail or studded leather, but only for short periods. If an adventuring party is lost in the wilderness, kender have a 50% chance of determining the correct direction.</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Habitat/Society:</b> The basic unit of kender society is the family consisting of parents and their children A kender child stays with his parents until his early 20s, at which time he becomes subject to wanderlust. A kender experiencing wanderlust is overwhelmed by his natural curiosity and desire for action he is compelled to wander the land as far as he can go. Wanderlust may last until the kender reaches his 50s or 60s, at which time he enters a life-phase called rooting - a compulsion to settle down with a mate and raise a child or two. This cycle of wanderlust and rooting is responsible for spreading kender communities across the continent of Ansalon.</p><p>Kender seldom have more than two offspring. A second child is never conceived until the first leaves home with wanderlust. Thus the parents give their undivided attention to each child.</p><p>An entire kender family lives in the same house, usually no more than a single room, comfortably furnished with stuffed cushions and wooden furniture. Building materials include whatever is available; kender have developed quite a knack for creating attractive homes from odd collections of stone, wood, brick, and thatch. No kender home contains locks of any kind.</p><p>Kender communities are democratic to the point of anarchy - every citizen is more or less allowed to do whatever he pleases. Kender see no reason to impose their views on anyone else. Since evil kender do not exist, there is little need for laws or a formal government. When an emergency arises that requires cooperation from the kender, they do so naturally; with minimal preparation, they can become a formidable, unified group.</p><p>This is not to say that the idea of government is totally without its appeal for kender. They have experimented with every conceivable form of government and are more than willing to give any new type a chance. They also follow any leader for as long as he remains interesting. Owing to the kender.s low tolerance for boredom, a new government or new leader seldom holds their attention for more than a few days.</p><p>There has never been a standing kender army. The occasional invaders attempting to occupy a kender village quickly became discouraged: not only were the kender tearless fighters, there was nothing much of interest in the village worth plundering, and the kender made hopelessly inept slaves. In fact, most kender find an enemy occupation to be a tremendous boost to the local economy, since the invaders always bring such interesting things for the kender to &ldquo;handle&rdquo;.</p><p>Though always welcome, non-kender visitors seldom stay longer than a week in a kender village - life among the kender is just too frustrating. It is not uncommon for a visitor to be relieved of all of his possessions within a few hours. Visitors are pelted by a constant barrage of questions and rambling, pointless stories.</p><p>Kender can be endearingly charming or shockingly vulgar. They are natural extroverts and enjoy making new acquaintances.</p><p>Though most are personable and friendly, they can also be obnoxiously talkative and nosy. Since kender do what they want when they want to do it, they resent being given orders. At the same time, kender are quite sensitive and can be easily hurt by indifference or intentionally cutting remarks.</p><p>Kender treasure their friends; if a kender's friend is injured or slain, the kender is usually overcome with grief and despair. Death is only meaningful to a kender when it comes to one whom the kender knows and loves, such as a family member or an adventuring companion, or when it strikes innocents, such as the victims of warfare or a natural disaster. In these cases, the anguish felt by the usually cheerfully kender is heart wrenching to behold - the depression lingers for days or even months after the event.</p><p>The concept of delayed gratification is alien to kender. They thrive on excitement and yearn for new adventures. Some kender believe that evil creatures are condemned to an afterlife where they will be bored for all eternity.</p><p>The kender's innate fearlessness gives them remarkable confidence. They remain calm and carefree even in the most life-threatening situations. The combination of fearlessness, uncontrollable curiosity, and impulsiveness invariably gets them into trouble, as they are forever peeking into dark corners and forging ahead into unexplored places. Kender often allow their curiosity to overcome what common sense they possess, especially when encountering an unusual monster. When a kender displays an uncommonly sensible attitude in a dangerous situation, it is probably because he realizes that death means never doing anything interesting again.</p><p>Kender have a unique approach to personal property and theft. Their intense curiosity feeds their desire to know how locks can be opened, how to listen in on other's conversations, and how to reach into pockets to find interesting things to look at. Thieving comes naturally to kender, and they see nothing wrong with it; what others might call &ldquo;stealing&rdquo;, kender call &ldquo;handling&rdquo;. Kender do not steal for the sake of profit, since they have little concept of value; they are just as happy with a chunk of purple glass as they are with a glittering diamond. Often they pick up an item out of curiosity and forget to return it. If caught red-handed with another's property, they offer an amazing range of excuses: &ldquo;I forgot I had it&rdquo; - &ldquo;I found it&rdquo; - &ldquo;I was afraid someone else would take it.&rdquo; More often than not, kender believe their excuses to be the truth. Ironically, kender dislike the idea of someone deliberately taking an item without the owner's permission; to be called a thief is considered a base insult.</p><p>Kender cannot learn to cast wizard spells because of their innate magical resistance, a legacy of their creation.</p><p>No evil kender are known to exist.</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Ecology:</b> Most races shun kender, finding their personalities and societies hard to tolerate. On the other hand kender have no prejudices and welcome the opportunity to socialize with outsiders, finding their customs and habits to be quite fascinating.</p><p>Kender are as curious about food as they are about everything else, and they consume anything that looks remotely edible. They are actually quite skilled chefs, and two of their recipes account for their only tradable goods. One is called dew drink, an alcoholic beverage distilled from sundews, gold in color with the flavor of honey. The other is called kender pak, a nutritious sweetbread made from six different grains, which tastes like caramel and cinnamon. A loaf retains its freshness for two months and is equal to two weeks rations. Since kender are notoriously poor businesspeople, they seldom receive more than a few worth less trinkets in exchange for these products.</p><p>Kender are fond of pets, the more unusual the better cats, dogs, and small birds are common but so are worms beetles and toads. Kender rarely use mounts, preferring to walk even over long distances.</p>\n","images":["<img src=\"grf/dl.gif\" width=\"150\" height=\"75\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Dragonlance\" title=\"Dragonlance\" align=\"right\">","<img src=\"img/kender.gif\" alt=\"Kender\" title=\"Kender\" border=\"0\" width=\"300\" height=\"360\" style=\"text-align:right;\" align=\"right\">","<img src=\"grf/add2_01.gif\" width=\"200\" height=\"56\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Advanced Dungeons & Dragons 2nd Edition\">"],"setting":"Dragonlance","statblock":{"Kender":{"Activity Cycle":"Any","Alignment":"Varies, but usually lawful or chaotic neutral","Armor Class":"8 (10)","Climate/Terrain":"Tropical subtropical, and temperate/Plains, forests, jungles, hills, and mountains","Damage/Attack":"1-6 or by weapon","Diet":"Omnivore","Frequency":"Rare","Hit Dice":"1","Intelligence":"Varies (6.18)","Magic Resistance":"See below","Morale":"Fearless (20)","Movement":"6 (9)","No. Appearing":"1-20","No. of Attacks":"1","Organization":"Family","Size":"S (3-4' tall)","Special Attacks":"See below","Special Defenses":"See below","THAC0":"19","Treasure":"Varies (typical individual: O,X; typical lair: P,M,Q,X)","XP Value":"Varies"}},"title":"Kender"},"sources":["2105"],"statblock_names":[],"title":"Kender","prev_key":"kelpie","next_key":"kenku","monster_path":"/appendix/kender"}},"staticQueryHashes":[],"slicesMap":{}}
