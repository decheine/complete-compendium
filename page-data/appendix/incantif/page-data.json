While the powers listed above are the most common, some aarakocra have different or additional powers.</p><p class=\"f\">A race of intelligent, birdlike creatures living in the deepest deserts of Athas, the rare Athasian <a href=\"/appendix/aarakocr\">aarakocra</a> spends its time soaring on thermals in search of food.</p><p>The aarakocra is 7 to 8 feet tall with a wingspan of 20 feet or more. Because of its large wingspan, an aarakocra can carry as much as 75% of its own body weight and still fly easily. An aarakocra can fly a short distance carrying a burden equaling 125% of its own body weight. The average body weight of a full grown male is 100 pounds and a female is 85 pounds.</p><p>Each wing has a &ldquo;hand&rdquo; at its midpoint, consisting of three fingers and an opposable thumb. The fourth finger forms the rigid leading edge of the wing. In flight the hands cannot be used, but on the ground the aarakocra can use its hands almost as a human would. The aarakocra's body is protected by a thin bony plate on the chest, much like a solid rib cage. Talons on its legs can be used as claws and can be retracted to reveal a second set of hands, also with three fingers and an opposable thumb. Except for the chest plate, the entire skeleton is hollow and extremely fragile.</p><p>From a distance, the Athasian aarakocra resembles a huge <a href=\"/appendix/bird\">vulture</a>. Its black eyes, set in the front of the head, provide excellent vision over a long range. The plumage is generally black with a white collar for adult males and black or brown with a smaller white collar for females. Adolescents are a mixture of brown and black. The beak is large and covers most of the head. Plumage begins at the crown of the head and is darker near the head, except for the collar. Athasian aarakocra speak their own language and the languages of vultures and other large birds. Some speak the common tongue (5% to 10% chance depending on how deep in the wastelands a tribe lives).</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Combat:</b> Aarakocra can fight in the air or on the ground. They prefer aerial combat since their bones are too fragile to withstand a solid blow from a human-sized opponent. In combat against creatures on the ground, they prefer to fly over their victim and drop weighted nets. Some aarakocra use darts to harass ground-based opponents.</p><p>If their opponents can fly, the aarakocra generally forgo the use of the net, although large groups sometimes use nets on flying creatures. Normally, aarakocra attack flying creatures with long spears, diving from above and allowing the momentum to carry the spear through the target. Such an attack doubles the damage if the aarakocra have been able to dive at least 50 feet. Only the very largest aarakocra can carry more than one of these spears, they can attack with both at once with no penalty, causing double damage on each strike. All diving attacks are made at +4 and should be treated as a charge attack. All other penalties and restrictions of charge attacks apply.</p><p>The effect of the aarakocra's nets depends on if the opponent is flying at the time it becomes entangled. Creatures on the ground that are hit by a net are entangled and unable to participate in any combat until they make a successful Strength check to get free of the net. Flying creatures hit by a net can no longer fly and immediately begin falling. If they cannot escape the net or use some magical means to arrest the fall, normal falling damage applies.</p><p>Unless victims are entangled in nets, aarakocra are cautious in ground combat. If the aarakocra outnumber their opponents they advance in a straight line and thrust with their spears. If outnumbered, or the opponents are particularly tough, the aarakocra withdraw. Victims entangled in nets are killed or incapacitated for use as food or ransom.</p><p>Athasian aarakocra are mindful of their physical limitations as well as their comparatively low psionic abilities. They do not normally initiate psionic combat. At the first sign of psionic powers from any of their victims, however, all aarakocra that have some ability will use whatever attack and defense modes they can in an attempt to destroy the threat. Large groups of is or more aarakocra may initiate psionic combat if their leaders feel they can win quickly and avoid physical combat.</p><p>In desperation, an aarakocra can attempt to bite an opponent in combat. Because of the unwieldiness of its beak, the aarakocra has a THAC0 of 18 if attacking with this appendage. Further, the birdman causes only 1d2 points of damage with the beak.</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Habitat/Society:</b> Athasian aarakocra live in tribes with 6-20 (2d8+4) members, depending on the prestige of the leader. The largest tribe ever recorded had 50 members. The tribal hunting territory depends on the size of the tribe, usually about 500 square miles for a tribe of 10 members. There are no rigid boundaries between tribes and border disputes are not uncommon.</p><p>Alignments of tribe members are similar to the alignment of the leader. A tribe that has a leader who is neutral good may have neutral good, chaotic good, lawful good, and true neutral members. A predominantly evil tribe does not recognize boundaries with other tribes and treats other tribes as inferior beings to be eliminated.</p><p>Athasian aarakocra aren't happy in enclosed spaces, but they they take refuge in a cave or building if necessary.</p><p>Nonevil tribes live in rocky aeries in the highest peaks they can find. Evil tribes are normally nomadic and use an aerie made by another tribe if they need to remain in an area for a long time, even if they have to evict the tribe that made the nest.</p><p>Aarakocra aren't friendly toward intruders in their territory, especially caravans. They try to extract a toll from the caravan for passage through the desert. Good-aligned tribes allow unhindered passage of caravans that pay a tribute. If someone refuses to pay the tribute, the aarakocra try to capture scouts or outriders from the party and hold them until an even larger tribute is paid. The payment may be either livestock or shiny objects. Aarakocra are smart enough not to be taken in by glass baubles instead of gems, although they cannot tell the difference between the more common gems and the rare ones.</p><p>Evil tribes ask for tribute and often attack a caravan whether it pays or not. Aarakocra always demand shiny objects such as stones. These tribes find humans and demihumans to be quite tasty and prefer them to other food.</p><p>Good-aligned tribes of aarakocra sometimes return a lost traveler to the edge of the desert after first removing any valuables the traveler may be carrying. On very rare occasions a tribe might return a lost group of travelers to the more frequently traveled parts of the desert, again after first taking any valuables as payment.</p><p>The oldest male is the leader of the tribal hunting party and has 4+4 Hit Dice. The oldest female is in charge of the tribal aerie and has 3+3 HD. In tribes that have more than 15 members, the next oldest aarakocra serves as shaman and has 3+3 HD; the shaman completes the triumvirate necessary for proper worship and the summoning of elementals. (Interestingly, no magic-using aarakocra has ever been recorded.) Tribes without a shaman cannot summon <a href=\"/appendix/element1\">air elementals</a>, which is an important part of aarakocra culture.</p><p>The shaman is the leader of the daily sun worship. Aarakocra worship the sun because it provides them with the thermals they need to soar in search of food. The shaman also leads the mystic rituals used to summon an air elemental. Summoning an air elemental is usually done only in preparation for the tribe's most sacred ceremony, the hunt. Small tribes must band together for this ceremony to allow the triumvirate to be formed.</p><p>The ceremony to summon an air elemental must be conducted at dawn and requires the oldest male and female to emit a highpitched keening whistle. The shaman conducts an intricate dance around them, simultaneously chanting an ancient summoning mantra.</p><p>The hunt is the final part of the initiation of adolescent aarakocra to adulthood and often takes the tribe far from their normal teritory. The target is always a <a href=\"/appendix/drakalsi\">silt drake</a>. The hunt is the only time the females leave the relative safety of the nest. Even an evil tribe will not interfere with a tribe on a hunt. An air elemental is often summoned to help find the drake, but never takes part in the actual combat. Although the adult members of the tribe take part in the initial phases of the combat, it is the initiates who deliver the final, killing blows to me drake. Scars from the hunt are considered a mark of pride among all aarakocra.</p><p>The females spend about eight months of the year incubating their eggs. Athasian aarakocra mate for life and a pair normally produces as many as 10 offspring. A female lays one egg a year. Constant incubation is not required because of the high daytime temperatures, so the females can maintain the nest and keep the tribe's treasure in order.</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Ecology:</b> Athasian aarakocra are high on the food chain and have no natural enemies other than <a href=\"/appendix/drakatha\">drakes</a>. Unless evil, aarakocra leave their own territory only to hunt the silt drake and return as soon as possible when the hunt is over. (Evil aarakocra attack others, as noted above.) Aarakocra eggs and hatchlings are sought after by wealthy land owners who wish to use the creatures as scouts and sentries. An egg can bring as much as 10 cp in Tyr's marketplace. Tribes that have had eggs or hatchlings stolen have long memories and sometimes take revenge against the thief at a later date. Captive aarakocra join any tribe they come in contact with.</p><p>Athasian aarakocra have a natural life span of 21-30 years.</p>\n","images":["<img src=\"grf/ds.gif\" width=\"150\" height=\"75\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Dark Sun\" title=\"Dark Sun\" align=\"right\">","<img src=\"img/aarakath.gif\" alt=\"Aarakocra (Athas)\" title=\"Aarakocra (Athas)\" border=\"0\" width=\"300\" height=\"360\" style=\"text-align:right;\" align=\"right\">","<img src=\"grf/add2_01.gif\" width=\"200\" height=\"56\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Advanced Dungeons & Dragons 2nd Edition\">"],"setting":"Dark Sun","statblock":{"Aarakocra (Athas)":{"Activity Cycle":"Day","Alignment":"Any","Armor Class":"7","Climate/Terrain":"Deep desert","Damage/Attack":"1d3/1d3 or by weapon","Diet":"Carnivore","Frequency":"Rare","Hit Dice":"2+2","Intelligence":"Average (8-10)","Magic Resistance":"Nil","Morale":"Steady (11)","Movement":"6, Fl 36 (C)","No. Appearing":"1d10","No. of Attacks":"2","Organization":"Tribal","Size":"M (20'+ wingspan)","Special Attacks":"Nil","Special Defenses":"Nil","THAC0":"17","Treasure":"Varies","XP Value":"65"}},"title":"Aarakocra (Athas)"},"sources":["2433"],"statblock_names":[],"title":"Aarakocra (Athas)","prev_key":"zygraat","next_key":"aarakocr","monster_path":"/appendix/aarakath"}}},"pageContext":{"monster_key":"incantif","monster_data":{"TSR":["2613"],"fullBody":"  <table cellspacing=\"0\" cellpadding=\"0\"><tr><th>Climate/Terrain:</th><td>Any</td></tr><tr><th>Frequency:</th><td>Very rare</td></tr><tr><th>Organization:</th><td>Solitary</td></tr><tr><th>Activity Cycle:</th><td>Any</td></tr><tr><th>Diet:</th><td>Special</td></tr><tr><th>Intelligence:</th><td>Supra-genius (19-20)</td></tr><tr><th>Treasure:</th><td>R&times;3 and incidental</td></tr><tr><th>Alignment:</th><td>Neutral (evil)</td></tr><tr><th>No. Appearing:</th><td>1</td></tr><tr><th>Armor Class:</th><td>0 or better</td></tr><tr><th>Movement:</th><td>12</td></tr><tr><th>Hit Dice:</th><td>9d4+18 to 9d4+26</td></tr><tr><th>THAC0:</th><td>13</td></tr><tr><th>No. of Attacks:</th><td>1</td></tr><tr><th>Damage/Attack:</th><td>By weapon</td></tr><tr><th>Special Attacks:</th><td>Spells</td></tr><tr><th>Special Defenses:</th><td>Absorption</td></tr><tr><th>Magic Resistance:</th><td>20% + 5% per level over 9th</td></tr><tr><th>Size:</th><td>M (5-6' tall)</td></tr><tr><th>Morale:</th><td>Average (8-10)</td></tr><tr><th>XP Value:</th><td>13,000+</td></tr></table><p class=\"f\">Centuries ago, a faction called the Incanterium schemed and maneuvered in the <i>kriegstanz</i> of Sigil's factions. They were known as the Magicians or the Wanters; it's said they believed that the secret to everything was wizardly magic. Magic's powerful, the  Incanterium line went: so powerful that archmages change the rules of the worlds they deal with, so powerful that the gods themselves fear it. Any cutter with determination and savvy can make himself the high-up by learning all there is to know about magic. It's been done before, after all.</p><p>The Magicians spent their time and effort collecting every magical item, every scrap of magical lore they could lay their hand on. They collected it all in Sigil's Tower Sorcerous, a dark fortress of knowledge and ambition. The other factions'd try to use the Magicians by offering them magic in return for their help, or they'd scheme to steal a little of the Incanterium's knowledge back. In fact, there came a time when the Magicians were calling the tune, and the other factions were beginning to learn how to dance.</p><p>Then something happened. One day the folk of Sigil found that the Tower Sorcerous no longer stood over the skyline of the Clerk's Ward. Rumors spread that the Lady had put 'em all in the Mazes, and the better Sigil was for it. Some cutters believed that maybe the Magicians had challenged the Lady and failed. Others thought that each of the other factions'd found a way to put the Incanterium in the dead-book. It didn't matter; in time, the Incanterium was forgotten.</p><p>But they're not as lost as everyone thinks.</p><p>From time to time, one of the members of this ancient sect shows up, still pursuing his unattainable goal of mastering all the magic of the multiverse. Without exception, they're self-centered, ambitious cutters of tremendous magical power. They're called incantifers now.</p><p>An incantifer looks human enough on the outside, but just like a tanner who'll never be able to get the smell of his work off his skin, an incantifer reeks of magic. It's changed and twisted him on the inside. Incantifers usually appear extremely old and frail; they've used life-extending magics to defeat death, but youth for its own sake doesn't interest them. After all, it's a simple trick to <i>appear</i> youthful when it's necessary. There are two giveaways for an incantifer: first, his or her eyes're orbs of blank, shining silver; secondly, the magical strength that courses through them provides uncanny grace and agility despite their decrepit appearance.</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Combat:</b> Incantifers spurn physical conflict, since magic's cleary the best way to deal with any foe. There's a spell for everything, if a cutter knows it. As a matter of last resort, an incantifer can make use of an effective Strength of 18/51, punching for 1d3+3 points of damage or striking with a magical staff or similar weapon. Generally an incantifer throws a punch or physical blow only to clear himself enough room to cast a spell or use a magical item.</p><p>Without exception, incantifers are powerful mages. A typical incantifer has the spell ability of a 9th- to 18th-level (d8+10) mage. Most incantifers are specialists: wild mages, transmuters, conjurers, and evokers are the most common varieties. The incantifer's Hit Dice are tied to its magic-use level - a 9th-level incantifer has 9d4+18 hit points, and higher level incantifers have an additional +1 hit point per level. A special warning to berks thinking of tangling with an incantifer: They've had lots of time to find spells a body's never even heard of.</p><p>Incantifers also carry numerous magical items of varying power and effects. Generally, an incantifer has 2 to 5 useful po-tions (<i>extra-healing</i>, <i>invisibility</i>, <i>gaseous form</i>, or <i>invulnerability</i> are common); 1 to 3 scrolls (<i>protection from undead</i>, <i>dragon breath</i>, or <i>petrification</i>); 1 to 2 rings (<i>mind shielding</i>, <i>protection</i>, <i>regeneration</i>, or <i>wizardry</i> are preferred); 1 to 3 wands; and 2 to 5 miscellaneous magical items. An incantifer's Armor Class is based on the level of magical protection he carries, coupled with a Dexterity of 18. For example, an incantifer with an <i>armor</i> spell in effect, a <i>cloak of displacement</i> (+2 to AC), and a <i>ring of protection +3</i> is effectively AC -3.</p><p>Incantifers're also likely to be protected by long-lasting spells such as <i>armor</i>, <i>stoneskin</i>, a permanent <i>protection from normal missiles</i> or permanent <i>detect invisibility</i>.</p><p>In a fight, incantifers prefer to expend memorized spells first, since they're a renewable resource; they're peery of wasting valuable one-use magical items unless it's absolutely necessary.</p><p>All in all, it might seem that an incantifer's no different from a well-prepared mage who's had time to get his defenses and spells set just right. But there's one vitally important difference that makes an incantifer far more dangerous than a mage of equal level - incantifers can absorb magic. Any time a spell, spell-like effect, or spell-projecting magical item is used on an incantifer, she absorbs the effect if she passes her magic resistance roll. This heals 1 hp of damage per spell level absorbed, and enables her to cast spells without removing them from her memory, just as a <i>rod of absorption</i> does. Even a <i>dispel magic</i>can be absorbed. The only magical effects that can't be assimilated are magical weapons or <i>antimagic</i> areas. If the incantifer fails her magic resistance roll, she's still entitled to any normal saving throws permitted by the spell.</p><p>The altered physiology of an incantifer frees him of the need to breathe and makes him immune to nonmagical extremes of temperature or environment.</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Habitat/Society:</b> The original survivors of the Incanterium are very rare creatures; only a handful still walk the planes. Their apprentices and servants are more common. Every so often, an incantifer will consent to teach a talented mage the secrets of his or her abilities and cast a series of transformation spells that create a new incantifer. These younglings are the lowest-level incantifers, ranging from 9th to 14th level.</p><p>Incantifers are exceedingly paranoid about their magical caches and never leave them unguarded. In fact, they carry as much of their stashes with them as they can. An incantifer on the move can be a humorous sight, with dozens of pouches, satchels, and packs hanging from his garments. (Important piece of advice, berk: Don't laugh.)</p><p>Most incantifers've forgotten how to deal with people and view any cutter they meet as a potential source of magic. If a body runs across one in a tavern, he'll likely find the incantifer to be brusque, inconsiderate, and condescending. Incantifers don't always try to take what they want by force, but few of 'em have any patience for extended haggling or insults.</p><p>Some interesting peels or cross-trades've got incantifers at the bottom of them. It's not too unusual for a sharp blood to be approached by an incantifer with a job offer. These jobs can be pretty dangerous, since they typically involve separating some rare and unusual piece of magic from its rightful owner, but incantifers can pay quite well.</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Ecology:</b> The transformations that make a mage into an incantifer change his life processes. Breathing, eating, sleeping - none of these things matter to incantifers anymore. The only thing they live for is the collection of magic. An incantifer must absorb spell levels equal to his own experience level every month, or he permanently loses a level. Draining a magical item provides 1 spell level per 500 XP value of the device. For example, a 16th-level incantifer has to consume 16 spell levels of magic or 8,000 XP of magical items, or any combination of the two, within one month's time or be permanently reduced to 15th level. Incantifers trapped in magic-dead areas have been known to starve.</p>\n","images":["<img src=\"grf/ps.gif\" width=\"150\" height=\"75\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Planescape\" title=\"Planescape\" align=\"right\">","<img src=\"img/incantif.gif\" alt=\"Incantifer\" title=\"Incantifer\" border=\"0\" width=\"300\" height=\"360\" style=\"text-align:right;\" align=\"right\">","<img src=\"grf/add2_01.gif\" width=\"200\" height=\"56\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Advanced Dungeons & Dragons 2nd Edition\">"],"setting":"Planescape","statblock":{"Incantifer":{"Activity Cycle":"Any","Alignment":"Neutral (evil)","Armor Class":"0 or better","Climate/Terrain":"Any","Damage/Attack":"By weapon","Diet":"Special","Frequency":"Very rare","Hit Dice":"9d4+18 to 9d4+26","Intelligence":"Supra-genius (19-20)","Magic Resistance":"20% + 5% per level over 9th","Morale":"Average (8-10)","Movement":"12","No. Appearing":"1","No. of Attacks":"1","Organization":"Solitary","Size":"M (5-6' tall)","Special Attacks":"Spells","Special Defenses":"Absorption","THAC0":"13","Treasure":"R&times;3 and incidental","XP Value":"13,000+"}},"title":"Incantifer"},"sources":["2613"],"statblock_names":[],"title":"Incantifer","prev_key":"impwishi","next_key":"incarnat","monster_path":"/appendix/incantif"}},"staticQueryHashes":[],"slicesMap":{}}
