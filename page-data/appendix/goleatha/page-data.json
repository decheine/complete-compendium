While the powers listed above are the most common, some aarakocra have different or additional powers.</p><p class=\"f\">A race of intelligent, birdlike creatures living in the deepest deserts of Athas, the rare Athasian <a href=\"/appendix/aarakocr\">aarakocra</a> spends its time soaring on thermals in search of food.</p><p>The aarakocra is 7 to 8 feet tall with a wingspan of 20 feet or more. Because of its large wingspan, an aarakocra can carry as much as 75% of its own body weight and still fly easily. An aarakocra can fly a short distance carrying a burden equaling 125% of its own body weight. The average body weight of a full grown male is 100 pounds and a female is 85 pounds.</p><p>Each wing has a &ldquo;hand&rdquo; at its midpoint, consisting of three fingers and an opposable thumb. The fourth finger forms the rigid leading edge of the wing. In flight the hands cannot be used, but on the ground the aarakocra can use its hands almost as a human would. The aarakocra's body is protected by a thin bony plate on the chest, much like a solid rib cage. Talons on its legs can be used as claws and can be retracted to reveal a second set of hands, also with three fingers and an opposable thumb. Except for the chest plate, the entire skeleton is hollow and extremely fragile.</p><p>From a distance, the Athasian aarakocra resembles a huge <a href=\"/appendix/bird\">vulture</a>. Its black eyes, set in the front of the head, provide excellent vision over a long range. The plumage is generally black with a white collar for adult males and black or brown with a smaller white collar for females. Adolescents are a mixture of brown and black. The beak is large and covers most of the head. Plumage begins at the crown of the head and is darker near the head, except for the collar. Athasian aarakocra speak their own language and the languages of vultures and other large birds. Some speak the common tongue (5% to 10% chance depending on how deep in the wastelands a tribe lives).</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Combat:</b> Aarakocra can fight in the air or on the ground. They prefer aerial combat since their bones are too fragile to withstand a solid blow from a human-sized opponent. In combat against creatures on the ground, they prefer to fly over their victim and drop weighted nets. Some aarakocra use darts to harass ground-based opponents.</p><p>If their opponents can fly, the aarakocra generally forgo the use of the net, although large groups sometimes use nets on flying creatures. Normally, aarakocra attack flying creatures with long spears, diving from above and allowing the momentum to carry the spear through the target. Such an attack doubles the damage if the aarakocra have been able to dive at least 50 feet. Only the very largest aarakocra can carry more than one of these spears, they can attack with both at once with no penalty, causing double damage on each strike. All diving attacks are made at +4 and should be treated as a charge attack. All other penalties and restrictions of charge attacks apply.</p><p>The effect of the aarakocra's nets depends on if the opponent is flying at the time it becomes entangled. Creatures on the ground that are hit by a net are entangled and unable to participate in any combat until they make a successful Strength check to get free of the net. Flying creatures hit by a net can no longer fly and immediately begin falling. If they cannot escape the net or use some magical means to arrest the fall, normal falling damage applies.</p><p>Unless victims are entangled in nets, aarakocra are cautious in ground combat. If the aarakocra outnumber their opponents they advance in a straight line and thrust with their spears. If outnumbered, or the opponents are particularly tough, the aarakocra withdraw. Victims entangled in nets are killed or incapacitated for use as food or ransom.</p><p>Athasian aarakocra are mindful of their physical limitations as well as their comparatively low psionic abilities. They do not normally initiate psionic combat. At the first sign of psionic powers from any of their victims, however, all aarakocra that have some ability will use whatever attack and defense modes they can in an attempt to destroy the threat. Large groups of is or more aarakocra may initiate psionic combat if their leaders feel they can win quickly and avoid physical combat.</p><p>In desperation, an aarakocra can attempt to bite an opponent in combat. Because of the unwieldiness of its beak, the aarakocra has a THAC0 of 18 if attacking with this appendage. Further, the birdman causes only 1d2 points of damage with the beak.</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Habitat/Society:</b> Athasian aarakocra live in tribes with 6-20 (2d8+4) members, depending on the prestige of the leader. The largest tribe ever recorded had 50 members. The tribal hunting territory depends on the size of the tribe, usually about 500 square miles for a tribe of 10 members. There are no rigid boundaries between tribes and border disputes are not uncommon.</p><p>Alignments of tribe members are similar to the alignment of the leader. A tribe that has a leader who is neutral good may have neutral good, chaotic good, lawful good, and true neutral members. A predominantly evil tribe does not recognize boundaries with other tribes and treats other tribes as inferior beings to be eliminated.</p><p>Athasian aarakocra aren't happy in enclosed spaces, but they they take refuge in a cave or building if necessary.</p><p>Nonevil tribes live in rocky aeries in the highest peaks they can find. Evil tribes are normally nomadic and use an aerie made by another tribe if they need to remain in an area for a long time, even if they have to evict the tribe that made the nest.</p><p>Aarakocra aren't friendly toward intruders in their territory, especially caravans. They try to extract a toll from the caravan for passage through the desert. Good-aligned tribes allow unhindered passage of caravans that pay a tribute. If someone refuses to pay the tribute, the aarakocra try to capture scouts or outriders from the party and hold them until an even larger tribute is paid. The payment may be either livestock or shiny objects. Aarakocra are smart enough not to be taken in by glass baubles instead of gems, although they cannot tell the difference between the more common gems and the rare ones.</p><p>Evil tribes ask for tribute and often attack a caravan whether it pays or not. Aarakocra always demand shiny objects such as stones. These tribes find humans and demihumans to be quite tasty and prefer them to other food.</p><p>Good-aligned tribes of aarakocra sometimes return a lost traveler to the edge of the desert after first removing any valuables the traveler may be carrying. On very rare occasions a tribe might return a lost group of travelers to the more frequently traveled parts of the desert, again after first taking any valuables as payment.</p><p>The oldest male is the leader of the tribal hunting party and has 4+4 Hit Dice. The oldest female is in charge of the tribal aerie and has 3+3 HD. In tribes that have more than 15 members, the next oldest aarakocra serves as shaman and has 3+3 HD; the shaman completes the triumvirate necessary for proper worship and the summoning of elementals. (Interestingly, no magic-using aarakocra has ever been recorded.) Tribes without a shaman cannot summon <a href=\"/appendix/element1\">air elementals</a>, which is an important part of aarakocra culture.</p><p>The shaman is the leader of the daily sun worship. Aarakocra worship the sun because it provides them with the thermals they need to soar in search of food. The shaman also leads the mystic rituals used to summon an air elemental. Summoning an air elemental is usually done only in preparation for the tribe's most sacred ceremony, the hunt. Small tribes must band together for this ceremony to allow the triumvirate to be formed.</p><p>The ceremony to summon an air elemental must be conducted at dawn and requires the oldest male and female to emit a highpitched keening whistle. The shaman conducts an intricate dance around them, simultaneously chanting an ancient summoning mantra.</p><p>The hunt is the final part of the initiation of adolescent aarakocra to adulthood and often takes the tribe far from their normal teritory. The target is always a <a href=\"/appendix/drakalsi\">silt drake</a>. The hunt is the only time the females leave the relative safety of the nest. Even an evil tribe will not interfere with a tribe on a hunt. An air elemental is often summoned to help find the drake, but never takes part in the actual combat. Although the adult members of the tribe take part in the initial phases of the combat, it is the initiates who deliver the final, killing blows to me drake. Scars from the hunt are considered a mark of pride among all aarakocra.</p><p>The females spend about eight months of the year incubating their eggs. Athasian aarakocra mate for life and a pair normally produces as many as 10 offspring. A female lays one egg a year. Constant incubation is not required because of the high daytime temperatures, so the females can maintain the nest and keep the tribe's treasure in order.</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Ecology:</b> Athasian aarakocra are high on the food chain and have no natural enemies other than <a href=\"/appendix/drakatha\">drakes</a>. Unless evil, aarakocra leave their own territory only to hunt the silt drake and return as soon as possible when the hunt is over. (Evil aarakocra attack others, as noted above.) Aarakocra eggs and hatchlings are sought after by wealthy land owners who wish to use the creatures as scouts and sentries. An egg can bring as much as 10 cp in Tyr's marketplace. Tribes that have had eggs or hatchlings stolen have long memories and sometimes take revenge against the thief at a later date. Captive aarakocra join any tribe they come in contact with.</p><p>Athasian aarakocra have a natural life span of 21-30 years.</p><br clear=\"all\" style=\"clear:both; height:0;\">\r\n","images":["<img src=\"grf/ds.gif\" width=\"150\" height=\"75\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Dark Sun\" title=\"Dark Sun\" align=\"right\">","<img src=\"img/aarakath.gif\" alt=\"Aarakocra (Athas)\" title=\"Aarakocra (Athas)\" border=\"0\" width=\"300\" height=\"360\" style=\"text-align:right;\" align=\"right\">","<img src=\"grf/add2_01.gif\" width=\"200\" height=\"56\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Advanced Dungeons & Dragons 2nd Edition\">"],"setting":"Dark Sun","statblock":{"Aarakocra (Athas)":{"Activity Cycle":"Day","Alignment":"Any","Armor Class":"7","Climate/Terrain":"Deep desert","Damage/Attack":"1d3/1d3 or by weapon","Diet":"Carnivore","Frequency":"Rare","Hit Dice":"2+2","Intelligence":"Average (8-10)","Magic Resistance":"Nil","Morale":"Steady (11)","Movement":"6, Fl 36 (C)","No. Appearing":"1d10","No. of Attacks":"2","Organization":"Tribal","Size":"M (20'+ wingspan)","Special Attacks":"Nil","Special Defenses":"Nil","THAC0":"17","Treasure":"Varies","XP Value":"65"}},"title":"Aarakocra (Athas)"},"sources":["2433"],"statblock_names":[],"title":"Aarakocra (Athas)","prev_key":"zygraat","next_key":"aarakocr","monster_path":"/appendix/aarakath"}}},"pageContext":{"monster_key":"goleatha","monster_data":{"TSR":["2405","2433"],"fullBody":"  <p class=\"f\"><a href=\"/appendix/golem\">Golems</a> are automatons of great strength created through the combination of powerful magics and specific materials. Athasian golems are different in nature and type than those found on other worlds, reflecting the unique culture and mythos of this desert world. There are eight different types of Athasian golems: <a href=\"/appendix/goleath1\">ash</a>, <a href=\"/appendix/goleath1\">chitin</a>, <a href=\"/appendix/goleamag\">magma</a>, <a href=\"/appendix/goleath2\">obsidian</a>, <a href=\"/appendix/goleath2\">rock</a>, <a href=\"/appendix/goleasal\">salt</a>, <a href=\"/appendix/goleath3\">sand</a>, and <a href=\"/appendix/goleath3\">wood</a>.</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Background:</b> The true origin of golems on the world of Athas has been long-since lost in the annals of history. Regardless of their origin, the process by which one creates such a being is still undertaken by sorcerer kings, powerful templars, and high-level wizards who jealously guard the secrets of the process, just as a <a href=\"/appendix/dragon\">dragon</a> protects its hoard.</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Theory:</b> The creation of a golem requires not only powerful magics, but specific elements, as well. The need for whatever specified elemental material stems from a link to the quasielemental and paraelemental planes of existence. The elemental form of the golem on Athas acts as a conduit for the awesome energy possessed by the spirits on those planes. Each spirit, attuned to a specific element, imbues life within the concoction of material and arcane magic. Only through exacting craftsmanship can the creator establish this link between spirit and golem, forging a union that stays with the creation until it is broken by equally tremendous forces.</p><p>Even most sages do not fully grasp the process of trapping an elemental spirit within the body of a golem, though many have tried. Perhaps more terrifying is that the sorcerer kings and templars who create golems at whim, and with considerable effort, do not completely understand the risks they are taking. An elemental spirit, bound to Athas via the corporeal link of the golem, is not necessarily appreciative of its captivity. In fact, such spirits not only despise the one who forges the golem, but all life found upon the material plane of existence. Consult the specific listings of each golem type for how the bound spirits react to commands from beings on Athas.</p><p>The actual creation of the golem's physical body is extremely complicated. The ability is far from common and the creation of golems often requires multiple makers, some for the body and others for the process of enchantment.</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Common Characteristics:</b> All golems possess several traits that distinguish them from other types of golems, but all share multiple characteristics that define them as golems. Because of their magical nature, golems can be damaged only by magical weapons of +l or greater.</p><p>Golems have a variety of immunities, including all mind affecting spells (such as <i>charm</i>, <i>feeblemind</i>, <i>sleep</i>, <i>suggestion</i>), poisons, disease, and suffocation. Similarly, they cannot be affected by the psionic powers of most disciplines, except for telekinesis and psychoportation, that affect their physical being as opposed to their psyche. Golems exhibit no psionic tendencies themselves. A particularly useful spell when combating golems is <i>dispel magic</i>. The spell does not destroy the magical bonds that hold the golem together, but makes the golem fall to the ground, seemingly lifeless, for a number of rounds equal to the caster's level. To avoid this, golems must successfully save vs. spells. The elemental spirit is still bound within the golems if the spell succeeds; it is simply free from the creator's bidding during the duration of the <i>dispel magic</i>'s effect, though it cannot force the golems' bodies to react during that time.</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Golem Creation:</b> <b>Golem Creation:</b> Below are the basic requirements for the creation of all the types of golems found on Athas. In addition to the requirements listed, those creating Athasian golems need to be knowledgeable in the arcane magics which allow the link between elemental spirit and golem body to be formed. These secret magics are known only to the sorcerer-kings and their most trusted templars.</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Ash Golem Creation</b></p><p class=\"ni\">Only a wizard of at least 16th level can create an ash golem. The body is composed of a mixture of ash and the blood of an <a href=\"/appendix/drakafir\">Athasian fire drake</a>; it is cast in a mold carved into the form of the golem. Other materials and components needed cost 2,000 gold pieces and are consumed in the casting. The spells required are <i>wish</i>, <i>burning hands</i>, <i>polymorph any object</i>, and <i>geas</i>.</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Chitin Golem Creation</b></p><p class=\"ni\">Only a defiler of at least 17th level can create a chitin golem. The body is formed of pieces of insect carcasses laid in the shape of the golem. The body is then coated with an ointment created from the blood of an <a href=\"/appendix/drakaear\">Athasian earth drake</a>. Most spell casters use the bodies of dead <a href=\"/appendix/animdoa1\">kanks</a> in the creation of chitin golems, though any insect carapace will suffice. Other materials and spell components cost 2,500 gold pieces and are consumed in the casting. Among these materials are an elixir made from the juices of fruit <i>potions of animal control</i> and <i>vitality</i>. The spells required are <i>wish</i>, <i>animate dead</i>, <i>polymorph other</i>, and <i>geas</i>.</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Magma Golem Creation</b></p><p class=\"ni\">The creation of a magma golem requires a defiler of at least 18th level. The creator must collect enough raw material from the Ring of Fire and shape it within a mold of diamond. Though most of the other materials - flint, sulfur, and volcanic ash - are comparatively inexpensive (100 gp total), the diamond mold costs 10,000 gp. All the components but the mold are consumed during the enchanting process. After six months of extensive shaping and casting, the finished golem is ready. The spells required for the construction of a magma golem are <i>geas</i>, <i>meteor swarm</i>, <i>stone shape</i>, and <i>wish</i>.</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Rock Golem Creation</b></p><p>Only a defiler of at least 16th level can create a rock golem. The body is carved from a solid piece of rock weighing at least 2,000 pounds and takes two months to complete. The required materials and spell components cost 2,000 gold pieces and are consumed in the casting. The spells needed are <i>wish</i>, <i>polymorph any object</i>, <i>move earth</i>, and <i>geas</i>.</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Salt Golem Creation</b></p><p>Any wizard of at least 18th level can forge a salt golem. The body is carved from a 2,000-pound chunk of rock salt during a two-month process. The required material and spell components, which are destroyed during creation, cost 2,000 gp. The spells necessary for the creation of a salt golem are <i>geas</i>, <i>move earth</i>, <i>polymorph any object</i>, and <i>wish</i>.</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Sand Golem Creation</b></p><p>The creation of a sand golem requires a wizard of at least 15th level. The body is formed by placing damp sand within a clay mold, shaped in the form of the golem to be animated. The process requires other materials and components that cost 1,500 gold pieces and are consumed in the casting. These materials include among them one cubic foot of silt taken from the Sea of Silt. The spells required are the same as those needed for a <a href=\"/appendix/golem1\">stone golem</a>, namely <i>wish</i>, <i>polymorph any object</i>, <i>geas</i>, and <i>slow</i>.</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Wood Golem Creation</b></p><p>Only a druid of at least 15th level can create a wood golem. The golem's body is made up of pieces from no less than five different wood types, one for each limb and one for the torso and head. The pieces are lashed together with prepared vines. A wood golem can only be created from wood that has been dead for at least one month. The other materials and spell components needed cost 1,000 gold pieces and are consumed in the casting. The spells required are <i>entangle</i>, <i>plant growth</i>, <i>animate object</i>, <i>commune</i>, <i>imbue with spell ability</i>, <i>prayer</i>, and <i>bless</i>.</p><br clear=\"all\" style=\"clear:both; height:0;\">\r\n","images":["<img src=\"grf/ds.gif\" width=\"150\" height=\"75\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Dark Sun\" title=\"Dark Sun\" align=\"right\">","<img src=\"grf/add2_01.gif\" width=\"200\" height=\"56\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Advanced Dungeons & Dragons 2nd Edition\">"],"setting":"Dark Sun","title":"Golem (Athas), General Information"},"sources":["2405","2433"],"statblock_names":[],"title":"Golem (Athas), General Information","prev_key":"goleath3","next_key":"golebrai","monster_path":"/appendix/goleatha"}},"staticQueryHashes":[],"slicesMap":{}}
