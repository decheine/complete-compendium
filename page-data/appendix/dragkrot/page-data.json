While the powers listed above are the most common, some aarakocra have different or additional powers.</p><p class=\"f\">A race of intelligent, birdlike creatures living in the deepest deserts of Athas, the rare Athasian <a href=\"/appendix/aarakocr\">aarakocra</a> spends its time soaring on thermals in search of food.</p><p>The aarakocra is 7 to 8 feet tall with a wingspan of 20 feet or more. Because of its large wingspan, an aarakocra can carry as much as 75% of its own body weight and still fly easily. An aarakocra can fly a short distance carrying a burden equaling 125% of its own body weight. The average body weight of a full grown male is 100 pounds and a female is 85 pounds.</p><p>Each wing has a &ldquo;hand&rdquo; at its midpoint, consisting of three fingers and an opposable thumb. The fourth finger forms the rigid leading edge of the wing. In flight the hands cannot be used, but on the ground the aarakocra can use its hands almost as a human would. The aarakocra's body is protected by a thin bony plate on the chest, much like a solid rib cage. Talons on its legs can be used as claws and can be retracted to reveal a second set of hands, also with three fingers and an opposable thumb. Except for the chest plate, the entire skeleton is hollow and extremely fragile.</p><p>From a distance, the Athasian aarakocra resembles a huge <a href=\"/appendix/bird\">vulture</a>. Its black eyes, set in the front of the head, provide excellent vision over a long range. The plumage is generally black with a white collar for adult males and black or brown with a smaller white collar for females. Adolescents are a mixture of brown and black. The beak is large and covers most of the head. Plumage begins at the crown of the head and is darker near the head, except for the collar. Athasian aarakocra speak their own language and the languages of vultures and other large birds. Some speak the common tongue (5% to 10% chance depending on how deep in the wastelands a tribe lives).</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Combat:</b> Aarakocra can fight in the air or on the ground. They prefer aerial combat since their bones are too fragile to withstand a solid blow from a human-sized opponent. In combat against creatures on the ground, they prefer to fly over their victim and drop weighted nets. Some aarakocra use darts to harass ground-based opponents.</p><p>If their opponents can fly, the aarakocra generally forgo the use of the net, although large groups sometimes use nets on flying creatures. Normally, aarakocra attack flying creatures with long spears, diving from above and allowing the momentum to carry the spear through the target. Such an attack doubles the damage if the aarakocra have been able to dive at least 50 feet. Only the very largest aarakocra can carry more than one of these spears, they can attack with both at once with no penalty, causing double damage on each strike. All diving attacks are made at +4 and should be treated as a charge attack. All other penalties and restrictions of charge attacks apply.</p><p>The effect of the aarakocra's nets depends on if the opponent is flying at the time it becomes entangled. Creatures on the ground that are hit by a net are entangled and unable to participate in any combat until they make a successful Strength check to get free of the net. Flying creatures hit by a net can no longer fly and immediately begin falling. If they cannot escape the net or use some magical means to arrest the fall, normal falling damage applies.</p><p>Unless victims are entangled in nets, aarakocra are cautious in ground combat. If the aarakocra outnumber their opponents they advance in a straight line and thrust with their spears. If outnumbered, or the opponents are particularly tough, the aarakocra withdraw. Victims entangled in nets are killed or incapacitated for use as food or ransom.</p><p>Athasian aarakocra are mindful of their physical limitations as well as their comparatively low psionic abilities. They do not normally initiate psionic combat. At the first sign of psionic powers from any of their victims, however, all aarakocra that have some ability will use whatever attack and defense modes they can in an attempt to destroy the threat. Large groups of is or more aarakocra may initiate psionic combat if their leaders feel they can win quickly and avoid physical combat.</p><p>In desperation, an aarakocra can attempt to bite an opponent in combat. Because of the unwieldiness of its beak, the aarakocra has a THAC0 of 18 if attacking with this appendage. Further, the birdman causes only 1d2 points of damage with the beak.</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Habitat/Society:</b> Athasian aarakocra live in tribes with 6-20 (2d8+4) members, depending on the prestige of the leader. The largest tribe ever recorded had 50 members. The tribal hunting territory depends on the size of the tribe, usually about 500 square miles for a tribe of 10 members. There are no rigid boundaries between tribes and border disputes are not uncommon.</p><p>Alignments of tribe members are similar to the alignment of the leader. A tribe that has a leader who is neutral good may have neutral good, chaotic good, lawful good, and true neutral members. A predominantly evil tribe does not recognize boundaries with other tribes and treats other tribes as inferior beings to be eliminated.</p><p>Athasian aarakocra aren't happy in enclosed spaces, but they they take refuge in a cave or building if necessary.</p><p>Nonevil tribes live in rocky aeries in the highest peaks they can find. Evil tribes are normally nomadic and use an aerie made by another tribe if they need to remain in an area for a long time, even if they have to evict the tribe that made the nest.</p><p>Aarakocra aren't friendly toward intruders in their territory, especially caravans. They try to extract a toll from the caravan for passage through the desert. Good-aligned tribes allow unhindered passage of caravans that pay a tribute. If someone refuses to pay the tribute, the aarakocra try to capture scouts or outriders from the party and hold them until an even larger tribute is paid. The payment may be either livestock or shiny objects. Aarakocra are smart enough not to be taken in by glass baubles instead of gems, although they cannot tell the difference between the more common gems and the rare ones.</p><p>Evil tribes ask for tribute and often attack a caravan whether it pays or not. Aarakocra always demand shiny objects such as stones. These tribes find humans and demihumans to be quite tasty and prefer them to other food.</p><p>Good-aligned tribes of aarakocra sometimes return a lost traveler to the edge of the desert after first removing any valuables the traveler may be carrying. On very rare occasions a tribe might return a lost group of travelers to the more frequently traveled parts of the desert, again after first taking any valuables as payment.</p><p>The oldest male is the leader of the tribal hunting party and has 4+4 Hit Dice. The oldest female is in charge of the tribal aerie and has 3+3 HD. In tribes that have more than 15 members, the next oldest aarakocra serves as shaman and has 3+3 HD; the shaman completes the triumvirate necessary for proper worship and the summoning of elementals. (Interestingly, no magic-using aarakocra has ever been recorded.) Tribes without a shaman cannot summon <a href=\"/appendix/element1\">air elementals</a>, which is an important part of aarakocra culture.</p><p>The shaman is the leader of the daily sun worship. Aarakocra worship the sun because it provides them with the thermals they need to soar in search of food. The shaman also leads the mystic rituals used to summon an air elemental. Summoning an air elemental is usually done only in preparation for the tribe's most sacred ceremony, the hunt. Small tribes must band together for this ceremony to allow the triumvirate to be formed.</p><p>The ceremony to summon an air elemental must be conducted at dawn and requires the oldest male and female to emit a highpitched keening whistle. The shaman conducts an intricate dance around them, simultaneously chanting an ancient summoning mantra.</p><p>The hunt is the final part of the initiation of adolescent aarakocra to adulthood and often takes the tribe far from their normal teritory. The target is always a <a href=\"/appendix/drakalsi\">silt drake</a>. The hunt is the only time the females leave the relative safety of the nest. Even an evil tribe will not interfere with a tribe on a hunt. An air elemental is often summoned to help find the drake, but never takes part in the actual combat. Although the adult members of the tribe take part in the initial phases of the combat, it is the initiates who deliver the final, killing blows to me drake. Scars from the hunt are considered a mark of pride among all aarakocra.</p><p>The females spend about eight months of the year incubating their eggs. Athasian aarakocra mate for life and a pair normally produces as many as 10 offspring. A female lays one egg a year. Constant incubation is not required because of the high daytime temperatures, so the females can maintain the nest and keep the tribe's treasure in order.</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Ecology:</b> Athasian aarakocra are high on the food chain and have no natural enemies other than <a href=\"/appendix/drakatha\">drakes</a>. Unless evil, aarakocra leave their own territory only to hunt the silt drake and return as soon as possible when the hunt is over. (Evil aarakocra attack others, as noted above.) Aarakocra eggs and hatchlings are sought after by wealthy land owners who wish to use the creatures as scouts and sentries. An egg can bring as much as 10 cp in Tyr's marketplace. Tribes that have had eggs or hatchlings stolen have long memories and sometimes take revenge against the thief at a later date. Captive aarakocra join any tribe they come in contact with.</p><p>Athasian aarakocra have a natural life span of 21-30 years.</p><br clear=\"all\" style=\"clear:both; height:0;\">\r\n","images":["<img src=\"grf/ds.gif\" width=\"150\" height=\"75\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Dark Sun\" title=\"Dark Sun\" align=\"right\">","<img src=\"img/aarakath.gif\" alt=\"Aarakocra (Athas)\" title=\"Aarakocra (Athas)\" border=\"0\" width=\"300\" height=\"360\" style=\"text-align:right;\" align=\"right\">","<img src=\"grf/add2_01.gif\" width=\"200\" height=\"56\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Advanced Dungeons & Dragons 2nd Edition\">"],"setting":"Dark Sun","statblock":{"Aarakocra (Athas)":{"Activity Cycle":"Day","Alignment":"Any","Armor Class":"7","Climate/Terrain":"Deep desert","Damage/Attack":"1d3/1d3 or by weapon","Diet":"Carnivore","Frequency":"Rare","Hit Dice":"2+2","Intelligence":"Average (8-10)","Magic Resistance":"Nil","Morale":"Steady (11)","Movement":"6, Fl 36 (C)","No. Appearing":"1d10","No. of Attacks":"2","Organization":"Tribal","Size":"M (20'+ wingspan)","Special Attacks":"Nil","Special Defenses":"Nil","THAC0":"17","Treasure":"Varies","XP Value":"65"}},"title":"Aarakocra (Athas)"},"sources":["2433"],"statblock_names":[],"title":"Aarakocra (Athas)","prev_key":"zygraat","next_key":"aarakocr","monster_path":"/appendix/aarakath"}}},"pageContext":{"monster_key":"dragkrot","monster_data":{"TSR":["2105","1050"],"fullBody":"  <p class=\"f\">The othlorx are variations of the standard <a href=\"/appendix/dragkryn\">dragons that appear in the world of Krynn</a>. Physically they are identical to the existing <a href=\"/appendix/dragon\">dragon</a> forms - brass, bronze, copper, and silver; black, blue, green, white, and red - though there are no gold othlorx. The difference is in their attitudes toward the world and other dragons.</p><p>The othlorx are part of the outcome of a choice faced by dragonkind, the choice created by Takhisis and the Wars of the Lance. When Takhisis released the evil dragons into Krynn, she expected all of her children (as she saw them) to come and fight at her side. Perhaps fortunately for the forces of good, the evil dragons were true to their natures. Not all heeded her commands. More than a few saw no gain for themselves in the battles to come, only the greater chance of death and misery. So they refused to come and fight at her side. Infuriated, Takhisis cursed these renegade dragons, causing them to become the first of the othlorx.</p><p>When the good dragons were bound by their oath to not interfere in the Wars of the Lance, they set out to search for their lost eggs. They traversed the globe, and more than a few scoured Taladas. Eventually the draconian hatcheries were discovered and the good dragons no longer felt compelled to honor their oath. They returned to Ansalon to take part in the war. However, not all the good dragons felt compelled to return. Some, especially those who had never laid a brood of eggs, refused and chose to remain in Taladas. They were shunned by their brothers and so joined the ranks of the othlorx.</p><p>The characteristics of the othlorx vary according to the dragon type and the individual personality of the creature. General behaviors of each are described below.</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Black Dragons:</b> These great beasts have found the southern wilderness of Taladas to be an ideal home with its vast marshes and steaming jungles. Originally selfish and loners, as othlorx they have become xenophobic in the extreme. Takhisis's curse has made them crazed and completely unpredictable. In general, they attack all but an obviously superior enemy on sight, but there are tales of times when they have been cordial, if highly eccentric. Othlorx <a href=\"/appendix/dragcbla\">black dragons</a> cannot cast any priest spells. They are chaotic neutral.</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Blue Dragons:</b> There are few <a href=\"/appendix/dragcblu\">blue dragons</a> among the othlorx, their naturally lawful (though evil) natures compelled the majority of them to heed Takhisis's call. Still, even among these honor-bound creatures there were some skillful enough to claim a loophole or create some elaborate justification for their refusal. Enraged, Takhisis stripped these blue dragons of their priest spells and has compelled them to forever honor their words, precisely, no matter what the statement or intention.</p><p>Already hostile to man, the blue othlorx now blame all their woes on the humans (who caused the Dragonwars anyway). They don't necessarily attack on sight, but they use all their abilities to cause harm and woe to this offensive race. Blue othlorx are extremely lawful evil.</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Brass Dragons:</b>  For the <a href=\"/appendix/dragmbra\">brass dragons</a>, becoming othlorx was not that difficult a decision. Always prone to be somewhat neutral, they readily allowed this side of their nature to become dominant. Although not cursed for their choice, they are shunned and repudiated by others of their kind. This has hurt them greatly, for they are highly social creatures. Isolated from their own kind, they sometimes become desperate for companionship and conversation. They have been known to visit the nomadic tribes of the steppes, simply to converse and gossip. Many are known by name to the tribesmen. They are neutral (good).</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Bronze Dragons:</b> Most of these enigmatic creatures, being both chaotic and good, responded to the call to battle the horrors of the evil dragons. However, some did not come, primarily because they never heard the call. Their friends and contacts are the creatures of the sea, mostly unaffected by the wars. Thus the news of the great battles never reached their ears. On rare occasions, <a href=\"/appendix/dragmbro\">these dragons</a> appear on land. They can display an amazing ignorance of current affairs and are considered somewhat backward by their dragon fellows. They hate <a href=\"/appendix/minokryn\">minotaurs</a> with a violent passion. Bronze othlorx are lawful good, but seldom involve themselves in worldly affairs.</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Copper Dragons:</b> <a href=\"/appendix/dragmcop\">Copper</a> othlorx, who in the past have prided themselves on their fine sense of humor, have become somewhat bitter and disenchanted with dragonkind in general since refusing to come to the aid of all good dragons. They see themselves as being unfairly treated, especially for something that's over and done with. They have no love of their fellow dragons nor any who profess to aid or support the dragon cause. Indeed, they delight in tormenting and irritating those good dragons they find, although they still will not cause permanent harm to their fellows.</p><p>Shunned by their fellows, the copper othlorx have taken a fancy to the gnomes of Taladas. They find the little fellows vastly amusing, recognizing the <a href=\"/appendix/gnomtink\">minoi</a> for the cosmic joke they really are. Copper othlorx are chaotic good (neutral).</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Green Dragons:</b> The green othlorx are obsessive, cruel, and malevolent creatures, indeed hardly different from their <a href=\"/appendix/dragcgre\">uncursed fellows</a>. Since they were unwilling to leave their sheltered groves, Takhisis found her revenge by binding them to those very lands. The green othlorx are filled with a violently territorial passion. Anything, including another of their own kind, is treated as a trespasser to be destroyed. This protectiveness keeps them from straying far or successfully mating. Their numbers have suffered a steady decline.</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Red Dragons:</b> Most of the <a href=\"/appendix/dragcred\">red dragons</a>, consumed by war-lust, eagerly went off to fight in the Wars of the Lance. However, a few who saw opportunities suddenly arise on Taladas refused to go. Takhisis cursed these creatures with a loss of the trait they most pride - their self-confidence.</p><p>The red othlorx are a strange lot. They are powerful creatures, still possessed with a great desire for wealth and bloodshed, but they doubt their own abilities and might. As a result, they have become skulkers, attacking from ambush and using every cowardly trick possible to overcome their fears of inferiority. When not in combat, they are excessively vain and boastful, again to compensate. If faced by a powerful foe (even one that seems moderately powerful), they will hesitate and wait for a chance to attack with surprise. The red othlorx are considered cowards by their kin. The red othlorx have no priest spells.</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Silver Dragons:</b> The <a href=\"/appendix/dragmsil\">silver dragons</a> have always felt a strong need to aid and assist mankind. Despite this, a considerable number of them refused the call to war, rationalizing this by claiming to remain behind to protect the humans of Taladas. While their motives were true and noble, they could not escape the guilt that came with their decision. Thus silver dragons are compelled to atone for their wrongs by traveling among humans in disguise They are obsessive about helping others and fighting evil when they find it and try to compel those traveling with them to join their cause.</p><p>They have become the most intolerant of dragon species with a rigidly defined code of good and evil. Their punishments are severe and final - death is the only fate for evildoers of any type. The silver othlorx are rigidly good, although they are now chaotic not lawful.</p><p class=\"f\"><b>White Dragons:</b> Of all the evil othlorx, the dull-witted <a href=\"/appendix/dragcwhi\">white dragons</a> have changed the most. They defied the call out of impulse, refusing because it didn't suit their mood. In return, Takhisis stripped them of all outward signs of intelligence. White othlorx cannot cast spells or speak. They are still intelligent and are perfectly aware of the powers they have lost. This only serves to increase their rage and savageness. They are extremely chaotic evil.</p><br clear=\"all\" style=\"clear:both; height:0;\">\r\n","images":["<img src=\"grf/dl.gif\" width=\"150\" height=\"75\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Dragonlance\" title=\"Dragonlance\" align=\"right\">","<img src=\"grf/add2_01.gif\" width=\"200\" height=\"56\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Advanced Dungeons & Dragons 2nd Edition\">"],"setting":"Dragonlance","title":"Dragon (Krynn), Othlorx, General Information"},"sources":["2105","1050"],"statblock_names":[],"title":"Dragon (Krynn), Othlorx, General Information","prev_key":"dragkodr","next_key":"dragkryn","monster_path":"/appendix/dragkrot"}},"staticQueryHashes":[],"slicesMap":{}}
