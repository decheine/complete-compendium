While the powers listed above are the most common, some aarakocra have different or additional powers.</p><p class=\"f\">A race of intelligent, birdlike creatures living in the deepest deserts of Athas, the rare Athasian <a href=\"/appendix/aarakocr\">aarakocra</a> spends its time soaring on thermals in search of food.</p><p>The aarakocra is 7 to 8 feet tall with a wingspan of 20 feet or more. Because of its large wingspan, an aarakocra can carry as much as 75% of its own body weight and still fly easily. An aarakocra can fly a short distance carrying a burden equaling 125% of its own body weight. The average body weight of a full grown male is 100 pounds and a female is 85 pounds.</p><p>Each wing has a &ldquo;hand&rdquo; at its midpoint, consisting of three fingers and an opposable thumb. The fourth finger forms the rigid leading edge of the wing. In flight the hands cannot be used, but on the ground the aarakocra can use its hands almost as a human would. The aarakocra's body is protected by a thin bony plate on the chest, much like a solid rib cage. Talons on its legs can be used as claws and can be retracted to reveal a second set of hands, also with three fingers and an opposable thumb. Except for the chest plate, the entire skeleton is hollow and extremely fragile.</p><p>From a distance, the Athasian aarakocra resembles a huge <a href=\"/appendix/bird\">vulture</a>. Its black eyes, set in the front of the head, provide excellent vision over a long range. The plumage is generally black with a white collar for adult males and black or brown with a smaller white collar for females. Adolescents are a mixture of brown and black. The beak is large and covers most of the head. Plumage begins at the crown of the head and is darker near the head, except for the collar. Athasian aarakocra speak their own language and the languages of vultures and other large birds. Some speak the common tongue (5% to 10% chance depending on how deep in the wastelands a tribe lives).</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Combat:</b> Aarakocra can fight in the air or on the ground. They prefer aerial combat since their bones are too fragile to withstand a solid blow from a human-sized opponent. In combat against creatures on the ground, they prefer to fly over their victim and drop weighted nets. Some aarakocra use darts to harass ground-based opponents.</p><p>If their opponents can fly, the aarakocra generally forgo the use of the net, although large groups sometimes use nets on flying creatures. Normally, aarakocra attack flying creatures with long spears, diving from above and allowing the momentum to carry the spear through the target. Such an attack doubles the damage if the aarakocra have been able to dive at least 50 feet. Only the very largest aarakocra can carry more than one of these spears, they can attack with both at once with no penalty, causing double damage on each strike. All diving attacks are made at +4 and should be treated as a charge attack. All other penalties and restrictions of charge attacks apply.</p><p>The effect of the aarakocra's nets depends on if the opponent is flying at the time it becomes entangled. Creatures on the ground that are hit by a net are entangled and unable to participate in any combat until they make a successful Strength check to get free of the net. Flying creatures hit by a net can no longer fly and immediately begin falling. If they cannot escape the net or use some magical means to arrest the fall, normal falling damage applies.</p><p>Unless victims are entangled in nets, aarakocra are cautious in ground combat. If the aarakocra outnumber their opponents they advance in a straight line and thrust with their spears. If outnumbered, or the opponents are particularly tough, the aarakocra withdraw. Victims entangled in nets are killed or incapacitated for use as food or ransom.</p><p>Athasian aarakocra are mindful of their physical limitations as well as their comparatively low psionic abilities. They do not normally initiate psionic combat. At the first sign of psionic powers from any of their victims, however, all aarakocra that have some ability will use whatever attack and defense modes they can in an attempt to destroy the threat. Large groups of is or more aarakocra may initiate psionic combat if their leaders feel they can win quickly and avoid physical combat.</p><p>In desperation, an aarakocra can attempt to bite an opponent in combat. Because of the unwieldiness of its beak, the aarakocra has a THAC0 of 18 if attacking with this appendage. Further, the birdman causes only 1d2 points of damage with the beak.</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Habitat/Society:</b> Athasian aarakocra live in tribes with 6-20 (2d8+4) members, depending on the prestige of the leader. The largest tribe ever recorded had 50 members. The tribal hunting territory depends on the size of the tribe, usually about 500 square miles for a tribe of 10 members. There are no rigid boundaries between tribes and border disputes are not uncommon.</p><p>Alignments of tribe members are similar to the alignment of the leader. A tribe that has a leader who is neutral good may have neutral good, chaotic good, lawful good, and true neutral members. A predominantly evil tribe does not recognize boundaries with other tribes and treats other tribes as inferior beings to be eliminated.</p><p>Athasian aarakocra aren't happy in enclosed spaces, but they they take refuge in a cave or building if necessary.</p><p>Nonevil tribes live in rocky aeries in the highest peaks they can find. Evil tribes are normally nomadic and use an aerie made by another tribe if they need to remain in an area for a long time, even if they have to evict the tribe that made the nest.</p><p>Aarakocra aren't friendly toward intruders in their territory, especially caravans. They try to extract a toll from the caravan for passage through the desert. Good-aligned tribes allow unhindered passage of caravans that pay a tribute. If someone refuses to pay the tribute, the aarakocra try to capture scouts or outriders from the party and hold them until an even larger tribute is paid. The payment may be either livestock or shiny objects. Aarakocra are smart enough not to be taken in by glass baubles instead of gems, although they cannot tell the difference between the more common gems and the rare ones.</p><p>Evil tribes ask for tribute and often attack a caravan whether it pays or not. Aarakocra always demand shiny objects such as stones. These tribes find humans and demihumans to be quite tasty and prefer them to other food.</p><p>Good-aligned tribes of aarakocra sometimes return a lost traveler to the edge of the desert after first removing any valuables the traveler may be carrying. On very rare occasions a tribe might return a lost group of travelers to the more frequently traveled parts of the desert, again after first taking any valuables as payment.</p><p>The oldest male is the leader of the tribal hunting party and has 4+4 Hit Dice. The oldest female is in charge of the tribal aerie and has 3+3 HD. In tribes that have more than 15 members, the next oldest aarakocra serves as shaman and has 3+3 HD; the shaman completes the triumvirate necessary for proper worship and the summoning of elementals. (Interestingly, no magic-using aarakocra has ever been recorded.) Tribes without a shaman cannot summon <a href=\"/appendix/element1\">air elementals</a>, which is an important part of aarakocra culture.</p><p>The shaman is the leader of the daily sun worship. Aarakocra worship the sun because it provides them with the thermals they need to soar in search of food. The shaman also leads the mystic rituals used to summon an air elemental. Summoning an air elemental is usually done only in preparation for the tribe's most sacred ceremony, the hunt. Small tribes must band together for this ceremony to allow the triumvirate to be formed.</p><p>The ceremony to summon an air elemental must be conducted at dawn and requires the oldest male and female to emit a highpitched keening whistle. The shaman conducts an intricate dance around them, simultaneously chanting an ancient summoning mantra.</p><p>The hunt is the final part of the initiation of adolescent aarakocra to adulthood and often takes the tribe far from their normal teritory. The target is always a <a href=\"/appendix/drakalsi\">silt drake</a>. The hunt is the only time the females leave the relative safety of the nest. Even an evil tribe will not interfere with a tribe on a hunt. An air elemental is often summoned to help find the drake, but never takes part in the actual combat. Although the adult members of the tribe take part in the initial phases of the combat, it is the initiates who deliver the final, killing blows to me drake. Scars from the hunt are considered a mark of pride among all aarakocra.</p><p>The females spend about eight months of the year incubating their eggs. Athasian aarakocra mate for life and a pair normally produces as many as 10 offspring. A female lays one egg a year. Constant incubation is not required because of the high daytime temperatures, so the females can maintain the nest and keep the tribe's treasure in order.</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Ecology:</b> Athasian aarakocra are high on the food chain and have no natural enemies other than <a href=\"/appendix/drakatha\">drakes</a>. Unless evil, aarakocra leave their own territory only to hunt the silt drake and return as soon as possible when the hunt is over. (Evil aarakocra attack others, as noted above.) Aarakocra eggs and hatchlings are sought after by wealthy land owners who wish to use the creatures as scouts and sentries. An egg can bring as much as 10 cp in Tyr's marketplace. Tribes that have had eggs or hatchlings stolen have long memories and sometimes take revenge against the thief at a later date. Captive aarakocra join any tribe they come in contact with.</p><p>Athasian aarakocra have a natural life span of 21-30 years.</p><p></p><br clear=\"all\" style=\"clear:both; height:0;\">\r\n","images":["<img src=\"grf/ds.gif\" width=\"150\" height=\"75\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Dark Sun\" title=\"Dark Sun\" align=\"right\">","<img src=\"img/aarakath.gif\" alt=\"Aarakocra (Athas)\" title=\"Aarakocra (Athas)\" border=\"0\" width=\"300\" height=\"360\" style=\"text-align:right;\" align=\"right\">","<img src=\"grf/add2_01.gif\" width=\"200\" height=\"56\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Advanced Dungeons & Dragons 2nd Edition\">"],"setting":"Dark Sun","statblock":{"Aarakocra (Athas)":{"Activity Cycle":"Day","Alignment":"Any","Armor Class":"7","Climate/Terrain":"Deep desert","Damage/Attack":"1d3/1d3 or by weapon","Diet":"Carnivore","Frequency":"Rare","Hit Dice":"2+2","Intelligence":"Average (8-10)","Magic Resistance":"Nil","Morale":"Steady (11)","Movement":"6, Fl 36 (C)","No. Appearing":"1d10","No. of Attacks":"2","Organization":"Tribal","Size":"M (20'+ wingspan)","Special Attacks":"Nil","Special Defenses":"Nil","THAC0":"17","Treasure":"Varies","XP Value":"65"}},"title":"Aarakocra (Athas)"},"sources":["2433"],"statblock_names":[],"title":"Aarakocra (Athas)","prev_key":"zygraat","next_key":"aarakocr","monster_path":"/appendix/aarakath"}}},"pageContext":{"monster_key":"dragatha","monster_data":{"TSR":["2408"],"fullBody":"  <table cellspacing=\"0\" cellpadding=\"0\"><tr><th>Climate/Terrain:</th><td>Any</td></tr><tr><th>Frequency:</th><td>Very Rare</td></tr><tr><th>Organization:</th><td>Solitary</td></tr><tr><th>Activity Cycle:</th><td>Any</td></tr><tr><th>Diet:</th><td>Omnivore</td></tr><tr><th>Intelligence:</th><td>High to Supra-genius (13-20)</td></tr><tr><th>Treasure:</th><td>Varies</td></tr><tr><th>Alignment:</th><td>Varies</td></tr><tr><th>No. Appearing:</th><td>1</td></tr><tr><th>Armor Class:</th><td>Varies</td></tr><tr><th>Movement:</th><td>Varies</td></tr><tr><th>Hit Dice:</th><td>Varies</td></tr><tr><th>THAC0:</th><td>Varies</td></tr><tr><th>No. of Attacks:</th><td>Varies</td></tr><tr><th>Damage/Attack:</th><td>Varies</td></tr><tr><th>Special Attacks:</th><td>See below</td></tr><tr><th>Special Defenses:</th><td>See below</td></tr><tr><th>Magic Resistance:</th><td>Varies</td></tr><tr><th>Size:</th><td>Varies</td></tr><tr><th>Morale:</th><td>Fanatic (17-18)</td></tr><tr><th>XP Value:</th><td>Varies</td></tr></table><p class=\"f\">Extremely powerful (20th-level) human and half-elven defiler/psionicists can progress to even greater power if they choose to transform themselves into <a href=\"/appendix/dragon\">dragon</a> form. To begin the transformation, the would-be dragon casts a <i>dragon metamorphosis</i> spell. This potent incantation is the first use a dragon makes of <i>psionic enchantment</i>. Most aspiring dragons lock themselves away and perform their metamorphoses in secret.</p><p>After the spell is successfully cast, the dragon drastically changes in both his powers and his physical appearance. Each stage of the metamorphosis is extremely painful. The exact appearance of the dragon differs with the level attained by the defiler, but the defiler will gradually grow in height and weight, take on reptilian features, and, eventually, lose all trace of its humanity. When the metamorphosis is complete, the dragon will be roughly 40 feet long and weigh 50,000 pounds (25 tons), with massive wings and almost impenetrable scales.</p><p>Once a character becomes a dragon, he gains certain benefits instantly. Dragons are immune to the effects of time. They no longer age and will never die of &ldquo;natural causes&rdquo;. Also, a dragon gains the ability to understand and speak any language - this innate ability functions like a <i>tongues</i> spell. This is a side effect of the psionic enchantment they employ to transform themselves.</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Combat:</b> The exact combat abilities of a dragon differ as it grows in size and power. This information is presented on a chart at the end of this entry, but a brief overview of the creature.s general abilities is provided here.</p><p>As a dragon advances, it retains all psionic powers it had previously and gains more. With every level advancement, the dragon gains one additional science and one additional discipline. He also gains psionic strength points for every level advancement just as described in the <i>Complete Psionics Handbook</i>.</p><p>In order to employ the devastating power of <i>psionic enchantment</i>, each dragon employs an obsidian orb as a focus. The orb itself is not magical, but is essentially a material component that is required for each psionic enchantment the dragon employs. A dragon can create any number of obsidian orbs and leave them in various places. Rarely is a dragon without an orb. However, before reaching a new level, the dragon must swallow all existing activated orbs as part of the material component for the <i>dragon metamorphosis</i> spell. Lack of an orb does not interfere with the dragon's ability to cast spells below 10th level or with psionic ability.</p><p>As dragons become more powerful, they can employ their deadly claws in combat. Even at their most rudimentary stage of development, these talons are extremely deadly. Also, the dragon eventually develops a savage set of teeth with powerful jaws, giving it a horrible bite attack. When its tail grows long enough, it becomes a sweeping bludgeon. Finally, the dragon gains a devastating breath weapon, a cone of superheated sand 5' wide at its base, 50' long, and 100' in diameter at the far end.</p><p>A dragon's hide and scales become harder and more invulnerable at each stage of metamorphosis. This is reflected by a sharp improvement in Armor Class, a resistance to non-magical weapons, and overall magic resistance.</p><p>These magical items presented in the <i>Dungeon Master's Guide</i> can affect character dragons:</p><p><i>Potion of Dragon Control</i>: If such a potion fruit is found in a Dark Sun campaign, it works against any dragon. Control lasts for 5d4 rounds.</p><p><i>Scroll of Protection - Dragon Breath</i>: The scroll functions just as described in the <i>DMG</i>.</p><p><i>Sword +2, Dragon Slayer</i>: In Dark Sun campaigns, this sword functions against any dragon, regardless of its level.</p><p><b class=\"bk\">Spells:</b> From <i>Tome of Magic</i>, two spells specifically concern dragons. <i>Dragonbane</i> functions just as described in that volume. <i>Age dragon</i> has no effect on Dark Sun dragons because they are effectively immortal.</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Habitat/Society:</b> Having attained 20th level, human and half-elven defiler/psionicists can choose to undergo a bizarre and painful metamorphosis from human to dragon. Once begun, the metamorphosis cannot be stopped except by the character's death.</p><p>All sorcerer-kings of the Seven Cities are at least 21st-level dragons. Though the monarchs have pursued these powers for many centuries, they are only becoming dimly aware that a similar process can also occur with especially powerful preservers (see <a href=\"/appendix/avangion\">Avangion</a>). Many are still skeptical.</p><p>From the 25th through 29th levels, the ascending dragon goes through a terrible rampaging period, brought on by the incredible pain that wracks its body during these final stages. No longer man but not yet a dragon, its need to end the process drives it nearly mad. Its original reason is superseded by an indomitable lust for destruction. The dragon destroys vegetation and animals that do not directly serve its quest for power and advancement.</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Ecology:</b> Defilers who have earned sufficient experience points to advance to the next stage must successfully cast the <i>dragon metamorphosis</i> spell. Once cast, the defiler's physical form mutates drastically, becoming less human and more dragon.</p><p>The exact material components, preparation time, and casting time differ depending on the level the defiler is about to achieve. The spells are grouped by level into low, middle, high, and final metamorphosis.</p><p><i>Low (21st, 22nd, and 23rd level):</i> The defiler is merely beginning the metamorphosis. The preparation for casting at these levels requires access to ancient documents, tablets, and scrolls that have never been studied by another defiler. Such materials must be studied for at least eight hours every day for an entire year. The material components must include vast riches (at least 10,000 gp worth of jewels, gems, coins, or artistic treasures), a huge structure where the transformation might take place, and no fewer than 1,000 Hit Dice of living creatures for the life-leeching process. The riches vanish and the living creatures are slain one heartbeat after the defiler begins casting. The spell is cast from the deep interior of the structure where the caster will actually transform. No other beings may be present at the instant of casting.</p><p><i>Middle (24th, 25th, and 26th level):</i> The preparation time extends to two years. During this time, the caster visits a powerful creature on an elemental plane for three days of every 15. The material components include fewer riches (at least 5,000 gp) but more living creatures (no fewer than 2.000 Hit Dice). A new structure must be built, which can be used for all three middle level transformations.</p><p><i>High (27th, 28th, and 29th level):</i> The high levels of dragon metamorphosis must take place on either an elemental or the astral plane. No structure or riches are required, but the caster must travel to the plane of choice with no fewer than 200 Hit Dice of living creatures from the Prime Material plane. The living creatures must be no fewer than 10 Hit Dice each and must willingly travel to the plane and participate (i.e., die) in the casting. Casting time is 24 hours, and at least three powerful beings from that plane must cooperate for that time.</p><p><i>Final (30th level):</i> This stage requires no preparation time and but a single material component; the slain body of a good creature defeated in single combat. The victim must be intelligent, have at least 20 Hit Dice, and be capable of casting 9th-level wizard spells or 7th-level priest spells. The spell must be cast over the fallen victim within one hour of the defeat; the casting time is one turn.</p><p class=\"f\"><b>The Dragon of Tyr</b></p>  <p class=\"ni\">The <a href=\"/appendix/dragotyr\">Dragon of Tyr</a> is a completely metamorphosized dragon of 30th level. The great dragon is a ferocious animal with tremendous psionic powers. Because no contenders have challenged the authority of the great dragon in many centuries, common tradition has held that there is only one dragon.</p><p>However, because the Tyr region is actually only a small part of a much larger world, there are probably other dragons in distant realms. Whether the great dragon is aware of other distant dragons, only it knows for certain.</p><p></p><h2>Dragon Ability Charts</h2><br><table class=\"ip sp\"><tr><th>Lvl</th><th>HD*</th><th>AC</th><th>THAC0</th><th>Claws</th><th>Bite</th><th>Breath</th><th>Tail</th><th>Move</th><th>MR</th></tr><tr><td>21</td><td>30+10</td><td>?</td><td>11</td><td>Nil</td><td>Nil</td><td>Nil</td><td>Nil</td><td>?</td><td>Nil</td></tr><tr><td>22</td><td>35+10</td><td>?</td><td>10</td><td>Nil</td><td>Nil</td><td>Nil</td><td>Nil</td><td>?</td><td>Nil</td></tr><tr><td>23</td><td>38+10</td><td>?</td><td>9</td><td>Nil</td><td>Nil</td><td>Nil</td><td>Nil</td><td>?</td><td>Nil</td></tr><tr><td>24</td><td>40+10</td><td>4</td><td>8</td><td>2d10</td><td>Nil</td><td>Nil</td><td>Nil</td><td>15</td><td>Nil</td></tr><tr><td>25</td><td>42+10</td><td>0<sup>1</sup></td><td>7</td><td>2d10</td><td>4d12</td><td>Nil</td><td>Nil</td><td>15</td><td>Nil</td></tr><tr><td>26</td><td>45+10</td><td>-2<sup>1</sup></td><td>5</td><td>2d10+5</td><td>4d12</td><td>Nil</td><td>Nil</td><td>15<sup>a</sup></td><td>Nil</td></tr><tr><td>27</td><td>48+10</td><td>-4<sup>1</sup></td><td>3</td><td>2d10+5</td><td>4d12</td><td>10d12</td><td>Nil</td><td>15<sup>a</sup></td><td>Nil</td></tr><tr><td>28</td><td>52+10</td><td>-6<sup>2</sup></td><td>1</td><td>2d10+10</td><td>4d12</td><td>10dl2</td><td>5d10</td><td>15<sup>a</sup></td><td>20%</td></tr><tr><td>29</td><td>56+10</td><td>-8<sup>2</sup></td><td>-1</td><td>2d10+10</td><td>4d12</td><td>20d12</td><td>5d10</td><td>15<sup>b</sup></td><td>40%</td></tr><tr><td>30</td><td>61+10</td><td>-10<sup>2</sup></td><td>-3</td><td>2d10+15</td><td>4d12</td><td>25d12</td><td>5d10</td><td>15<sup>c</sup></td><td>80%</td></tr></table><p class=\"ni\">* dragons use 4-sided Hit Dice<br>1 can be hit only by +1 or better magical weapons<br>2 can be hit only by +2 or better magical weapons<br>a now has a &ldquo;jumping&rdquo;
