While the powers listed above are the most common, some aarakocra have different or additional powers.</p><p class=\"f\">A race of intelligent, birdlike creatures living in the deepest deserts of Athas, the rare Athasian <a href=\"/appendix/aarakocr\">aarakocra</a> spends its time soaring on thermals in search of food.</p><p>The aarakocra is 7 to 8 feet tall with a wingspan of 20 feet or more. Because of its large wingspan, an aarakocra can carry as much as 75% of its own body weight and still fly easily. An aarakocra can fly a short distance carrying a burden equaling 125% of its own body weight. The average body weight of a full grown male is 100 pounds and a female is 85 pounds.</p><p>Each wing has a &ldquo;hand&rdquo; at its midpoint, consisting of three fingers and an opposable thumb. The fourth finger forms the rigid leading edge of the wing. In flight the hands cannot be used, but on the ground the aarakocra can use its hands almost as a human would. The aarakocra's body is protected by a thin bony plate on the chest, much like a solid rib cage. Talons on its legs can be used as claws and can be retracted to reveal a second set of hands, also with three fingers and an opposable thumb. Except for the chest plate, the entire skeleton is hollow and extremely fragile.</p><p>From a distance, the Athasian aarakocra resembles a huge <a href=\"/appendix/bird\">vulture</a>. Its black eyes, set in the front of the head, provide excellent vision over a long range. The plumage is generally black with a white collar for adult males and black or brown with a smaller white collar for females. Adolescents are a mixture of brown and black. The beak is large and covers most of the head. Plumage begins at the crown of the head and is darker near the head, except for the collar. Athasian aarakocra speak their own language and the languages of vultures and other large birds. Some speak the common tongue (5% to 10% chance depending on how deep in the wastelands a tribe lives).</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Combat:</b> Aarakocra can fight in the air or on the ground. They prefer aerial combat since their bones are too fragile to withstand a solid blow from a human-sized opponent. In combat against creatures on the ground, they prefer to fly over their victim and drop weighted nets. Some aarakocra use darts to harass ground-based opponents.</p><p>If their opponents can fly, the aarakocra generally forgo the use of the net, although large groups sometimes use nets on flying creatures. Normally, aarakocra attack flying creatures with long spears, diving from above and allowing the momentum to carry the spear through the target. Such an attack doubles the damage if the aarakocra have been able to dive at least 50 feet. Only the very largest aarakocra can carry more than one of these spears, they can attack with both at once with no penalty, causing double damage on each strike. All diving attacks are made at +4 and should be treated as a charge attack. All other penalties and restrictions of charge attacks apply.</p><p>The effect of the aarakocra's nets depends on if the opponent is flying at the time it becomes entangled. Creatures on the ground that are hit by a net are entangled and unable to participate in any combat until they make a successful Strength check to get free of the net. Flying creatures hit by a net can no longer fly and immediately begin falling. If they cannot escape the net or use some magical means to arrest the fall, normal falling damage applies.</p><p>Unless victims are entangled in nets, aarakocra are cautious in ground combat. If the aarakocra outnumber their opponents they advance in a straight line and thrust with their spears. If outnumbered, or the opponents are particularly tough, the aarakocra withdraw. Victims entangled in nets are killed or incapacitated for use as food or ransom.</p><p>Athasian aarakocra are mindful of their physical limitations as well as their comparatively low psionic abilities. They do not normally initiate psionic combat. At the first sign of psionic powers from any of their victims, however, all aarakocra that have some ability will use whatever attack and defense modes they can in an attempt to destroy the threat. Large groups of is or more aarakocra may initiate psionic combat if their leaders feel they can win quickly and avoid physical combat.</p><p>In desperation, an aarakocra can attempt to bite an opponent in combat. Because of the unwieldiness of its beak, the aarakocra has a THAC0 of 18 if attacking with this appendage. Further, the birdman causes only 1d2 points of damage with the beak.</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Habitat/Society:</b> Athasian aarakocra live in tribes with 6-20 (2d8+4) members, depending on the prestige of the leader. The largest tribe ever recorded had 50 members. The tribal hunting territory depends on the size of the tribe, usually about 500 square miles for a tribe of 10 members. There are no rigid boundaries between tribes and border disputes are not uncommon.</p><p>Alignments of tribe members are similar to the alignment of the leader. A tribe that has a leader who is neutral good may have neutral good, chaotic good, lawful good, and true neutral members. A predominantly evil tribe does not recognize boundaries with other tribes and treats other tribes as inferior beings to be eliminated.</p><p>Athasian aarakocra aren't happy in enclosed spaces, but they they take refuge in a cave or building if necessary.</p><p>Nonevil tribes live in rocky aeries in the highest peaks they can find. Evil tribes are normally nomadic and use an aerie made by another tribe if they need to remain in an area for a long time, even if they have to evict the tribe that made the nest.</p><p>Aarakocra aren't friendly toward intruders in their territory, especially caravans. They try to extract a toll from the caravan for passage through the desert. Good-aligned tribes allow unhindered passage of caravans that pay a tribute. If someone refuses to pay the tribute, the aarakocra try to capture scouts or outriders from the party and hold them until an even larger tribute is paid. The payment may be either livestock or shiny objects. Aarakocra are smart enough not to be taken in by glass baubles instead of gems, although they cannot tell the difference between the more common gems and the rare ones.</p><p>Evil tribes ask for tribute and often attack a caravan whether it pays or not. Aarakocra always demand shiny objects such as stones. These tribes find humans and demihumans to be quite tasty and prefer them to other food.</p><p>Good-aligned tribes of aarakocra sometimes return a lost traveler to the edge of the desert after first removing any valuables the traveler may be carrying. On very rare occasions a tribe might return a lost group of travelers to the more frequently traveled parts of the desert, again after first taking any valuables as payment.</p><p>The oldest male is the leader of the tribal hunting party and has 4+4 Hit Dice. The oldest female is in charge of the tribal aerie and has 3+3 HD. In tribes that have more than 15 members, the next oldest aarakocra serves as shaman and has 3+3 HD; the shaman completes the triumvirate necessary for proper worship and the summoning of elementals. (Interestingly, no magic-using aarakocra has ever been recorded.) Tribes without a shaman cannot summon <a href=\"/appendix/element1\">air elementals</a>, which is an important part of aarakocra culture.</p><p>The shaman is the leader of the daily sun worship. Aarakocra worship the sun because it provides them with the thermals they need to soar in search of food. The shaman also leads the mystic rituals used to summon an air elemental. Summoning an air elemental is usually done only in preparation for the tribe's most sacred ceremony, the hunt. Small tribes must band together for this ceremony to allow the triumvirate to be formed.</p><p>The ceremony to summon an air elemental must be conducted at dawn and requires the oldest male and female to emit a highpitched keening whistle. The shaman conducts an intricate dance around them, simultaneously chanting an ancient summoning mantra.</p><p>The hunt is the final part of the initiation of adolescent aarakocra to adulthood and often takes the tribe far from their normal teritory. The target is always a <a href=\"/appendix/drakalsi\">silt drake</a>. The hunt is the only time the females leave the relative safety of the nest. Even an evil tribe will not interfere with a tribe on a hunt. An air elemental is often summoned to help find the drake, but never takes part in the actual combat. Although the adult members of the tribe take part in the initial phases of the combat, it is the initiates who deliver the final, killing blows to me drake. Scars from the hunt are considered a mark of pride among all aarakocra.</p><p>The females spend about eight months of the year incubating their eggs. Athasian aarakocra mate for life and a pair normally produces as many as 10 offspring. A female lays one egg a year. Constant incubation is not required because of the high daytime temperatures, so the females can maintain the nest and keep the tribe's treasure in order.</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Ecology:</b> Athasian aarakocra are high on the food chain and have no natural enemies other than <a href=\"/appendix/drakatha\">drakes</a>. Unless evil, aarakocra leave their own territory only to hunt the silt drake and return as soon as possible when the hunt is over. (Evil aarakocra attack others, as noted above.) Aarakocra eggs and hatchlings are sought after by wealthy land owners who wish to use the creatures as scouts and sentries. An egg can bring as much as 10 cp in Tyr's marketplace. Tribes that have had eggs or hatchlings stolen have long memories and sometimes take revenge against the thief at a later date. Captive aarakocra join any tribe they come in contact with.</p><p>Athasian aarakocra have a natural life span of 21-30 years.</p><br clear=\"all\" style=\"clear:both; height:0;\">\r\n","images":["<img src=\"grf/ds.gif\" width=\"150\" height=\"75\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Dark Sun\" title=\"Dark Sun\" align=\"right\">","<img src=\"img/aarakath.gif\" alt=\"Aarakocra (Athas)\" title=\"Aarakocra (Athas)\" border=\"0\" width=\"300\" height=\"360\" style=\"text-align:right;\" align=\"right\">","<img src=\"grf/add2_01.gif\" width=\"200\" height=\"56\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Advanced Dungeons & Dragons 2nd Edition\">"],"setting":"Dark Sun","statblock":{"Aarakocra (Athas)":{"Activity Cycle":"Day","Alignment":"Any","Armor Class":"7","Climate/Terrain":"Deep desert","Damage/Attack":"1d3/1d3 or by weapon","Diet":"Carnivore","Frequency":"Rare","Hit Dice":"2+2","Intelligence":"Average (8-10)","Magic Resistance":"Nil","Morale":"Steady (11)","Movement":"6, Fl 36 (C)","No. Appearing":"1d10","No. of Attacks":"2","Organization":"Tribal","Size":"M (20'+ wingspan)","Special Attacks":"Nil","Special Defenses":"Nil","THAC0":"17","Treasure":"Varies","XP Value":"65"}},"title":"Aarakocra (Athas)"},"sources":["2433"],"statblock_names":[],"title":"Aarakocra (Athas)","prev_key":"zygraat","next_key":"aarakocr","monster_path":"/appendix/aarakath"}}},"pageContext":{"monster_key":"pardal","monster_data":{"TSR":["Dragon187"],"fullBody":"  <table cellspacing=\"0\" cellpadding=\"0\"><tr><th>Climate/Terrain:</th><td>Tropical/Jungles, forests, and grasslands</td></tr><tr><th>Frequency:</th><td>Rare</td></tr><tr><th>Organization:</th><td>Solitary</td></tr><tr><th>Activity Cycle:</th><td>Night</td></tr><tr><th>Diet:</th><td>Carnivore</td></tr><tr><th>Intelligence:</th><td>Semi- (4)</td></tr><tr><th>Treasure:</th><td>Nil</td></tr><tr><th>Alignment:</th><td>Neutral</td></tr><tr><th>No. Appearing:</th><td>1-2</td></tr><tr><th>Armor Class:</th><td>6</td></tr><tr><th>Movement:</th><td>12</td></tr><tr><th>Hit Dice:</th><td>4+2</td></tr><tr><th>THAC0:</th><td>16</td></tr><tr><th>No. of Attacks:</th><td>3</td></tr><tr><th>Damage/Attack:</th><td>1-4/1-4/1-6</td></tr><tr><th>Special Attacks:</th><td>Hypnotism</td></tr><tr><th>Special Defenses:</th><td>Immune to visual illusions and controlling spells</td></tr><tr><th>Magic Resistance:</th><td>Nil</td></tr><tr><th>Size:</th><td>M (5-6' long, excluding tail)</td></tr><tr><th>Morale:</th><td>Irregular (6-7)</td></tr><tr><th>XP Value:</th><td>650</td></tr></table><p class=\"f\">The laziest of the <a href=\"/appendix/catgreat\">great cats</a>, and also one of the most successful because of its magical method of attack, is the pardal. Of about the same size and build as a <a href=\"/appendix/catgreat\">jaguar</a>, its claws and teeth are smaller and less prominent, and its coloration is exactly the opposite of that animal; smoothly black all over with a rich speckling of tan or orange spots.</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Combat:</b> The pardal is neither an accomplished stalker, nor a powerful fighter able to take down prey by the strength of its limbs. On the hunt, it behaves as if success were a foregone conclusion - as if it had no fear that the prey would flee, fight back, or in any way make the life of the pardal difficult.</p><p>When it is hungry, it merely wanders about looking for any suitable game; a group of <a href=\"/appendix/mammsmal\">monkeys</a> or <a href=\"/appendix/mammsmal\">pigs</a> will do, but sometimes so will other predators like <a href=\":/appendix/link?dog\">wild dogs</a> or <a href=\"/appendix/wolf\">wolves</a>. Then, without any pretense of stealth, it ambles towards the prey in a nonthreatening manner that the victims are likely to interpret as disinterest. As the pardal's muscles needn't be as finely tuned as those of a normal predator, it tends to look less threatening than most; with its belly hanging loosely beneath it, it may even appear to have fed recently when it is actually at its hungriest, especially when viewed by the more stupid herbivores.</p><p>If it can get within 30' of its prey, any creatures within that range who look at the pardal, even at a glance, notice that the spots on the pardal's fur are not fixed - they flow over the black background in such as way as to produce a <i>hypnotic pattern</i> spell effect on all who fail a save vs. spells. This effect lasts for 2-5 rounds or until something drastically changes the situation within the group of hypnotized creatures.</p><p>Once a suitable group stands fascinated by the spell, the pardal selects a single target, usually the best eating of the lot, then advances to stare it straight in the face. To one already affected by the first spell, the pardal's golden eyes seem to spin crazily in their black sockets, an effect that causes the prey to be transfixed as by a <i>hold monster</i> spell, unless the victim makes a save vs. spells (no penalties or bonuses apply). The holding power of its eyes is stronger than the hypnotic effect of its fur, and causes a victim to stay rooted to the spot even as the pardal kills and devours it. As with the wizardly versions of this spell, the pardal's chosen victim cannot be freed from this spell without the intervention of <i>dispel magic</i> or stronger spells.</p><p>Conversely, the violence of the pardal's attack on its victim releases all other nearby creatures from its hypnotic pattern. Other effects, such as loud sounds or flashes of light, the appearance of a larger predator, or the wounding of animals besides the one chosen as prey (all of which could occur naturally or at the intervention of adventurers) will also break the hypnotic effect of the pardal's spots. While creatures with an Intelligence of 2 or higher are likely to learn to avoid an approaching pardal no matter how inoffensive it appears, the memory of a pardal attack rapidly fades in the minds of creatures with animal Intelligence (Int 1), so that it can usually prey on the same herd within a few weeks of a previous attack.</p><p>As a result of the ease with which it gets it meals, the pardal is found to be exceptionally weak for its size if forced into combat. It is physically weaker than other great cats and cannot employ its hind claws to rake prey. Given a choice, the pardal flees from persistent attackers, not being used to resistance from those it hunts. Moreover, its hypnotic powers operate only when it is hungry, so attacking a sated pardal is an even easier proposition.</p><p>Not only does the pardal employ hypnotic effects offensively, but it is also immune to outside illusions and charms. <i>Hold</i>, <i>charm</i>, and hypnotism-based spells have no effect whatsoever on pardals, and it is totally immune to visual illusions such as <i>phantasmal force</i>. Spells that target illusions at other senses have better effects. Instead of being immune to <i>improved phantasmal force</i> spells, a pardal saves against them at +6; it saves at +4 against <i>spectral force</i> spells, and it has no defenses against any illusions having no visual component at all, suffering a -2 penalty on its saves against these spells.</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Habitat/Society:</b> Just as the jaguar does, the pardal spends much of its time among the branches of trees; unlike its cousin, most of this time is spent napping, with relaxation only occasionally interrupted by the need to hunt for prey (and that requires little effort itself). A pardal is not territorial and will let other predators, including others of its own kind, share its range unless there is not game enough for two (in which case it will either kill the interloper when next it gets hungry, or simply leave to find more suitable accommodations).</p><p>Pardals are solitary animals, seeking the company of their kind only to mate. The lair of a female (50% of the population) sometimes has a single cub resident, but as they mate only rarely the lair will be solely inhabited 75% of the time. A young pardal takes two years to mature, and during that time it can only use the hypnotic tricks of an adult inexpertly (all victims' saves are made at +4), but as a single adult pardal can hunt as easily for two as for one, this is not a major drawback for the cub.</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Ecology:</b> Pardals are at the top of the food chain in the areas they inhabit, as even other predators fall prey to their special powers. Unlike other great cats, the population of pardals does not increase and decrease along with that of game around it; only a marked drop in all game in a region would threaten their food supply, so the pressure to exploit times of bounty is not strong in them.</p><p>Unfortunately for those trying to make a profit from selling pardal parts, the holding powers of its eyes are lost immediately upon its death, nor can the mere wearing of a pardal hide robe confer magical benefits on the wearer. The hide is still quite valuable to mages, who are likely to pay up to 2,000 gp for one in perfect condition as the primary component of a <i>robe of scintillating colors</i>, or of other magical items endowed with hypnotizing powers.</p><p>A live pardal might be worth up to 4,000 gp, as a creature immune to most of the standard ways of capturing live animals (such as <i>charm monster</i> or <i>hold monster</i> spells) is rarely seen in zoos or menageries. Because of their laziness, adults can also be tamed rather easily, to the same extent as a <a href=\\/appendix/catsmall\">house cat</a> (assuming that the trainer is immune to their magical powers). However, they cannot be fully domesticated or trained to attack on command; they can become an interesting ornament in a wizard's lair, but they would serve little purpose carried along with a group of adventurers.</p><br clear=\"all\" style=\"clear:both; height:0;\">\r\n","images":["<img src=\"grf/dr.gif\" width=\"150\" height=\"75\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Dragon Magazine\" title=\"Dragon Magazine\" align=\"right\">","<img src=\"img/pardal.gif\" alt=\"Pardal\" title=\"Pardal\" border=\"0\" width=\"300\" height=\"360\" style=\"text-align:right;\" align=\"right\">","<img src=\"grf/add2_01.gif\" width=\"200\" height=\"56\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Advanced Dungeons & Dragons 2nd Edition\">"],"setting":"Dragon Magazine","statblock":{"Pardal":{"Activity Cycle":"Night","Alignment":"Neutral","Armor Class":"6","Climate/Terrain":"Tropical/Jungles, forests, and grasslands","Damage/Attack":"1-4/1-4/1-6","Diet":"Carnivore","Frequency":"Rare","Hit Dice":"4+2","Intelligence":"Semi- (4)","Magic Resistance":"Nil","Morale":"Irregular (6-7)","Movement":"12","No. Appearing":"1-2","No. of Attacks":"3","Organization":"Solitary","Size":"M (5-6' long, excluding tail)","Special Attacks":"Hypnotism","Special Defenses":"Immune to visual illusions and controlling spells","THAC0":"16","Treasure":"Nil","XP Value":"650"}},"title":"Pardal"},"sources":["Dragon187"],"statblock_names":[],"title":"Pardal","prev_key":"parasite","next_key":"pasarini","monster_path":"/appendix/pardal"}},"staticQueryHashes":[],"slicesMap":{}}
