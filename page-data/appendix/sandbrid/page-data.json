While the powers listed above are the most common, some aarakocra have different or additional powers.</p><p class=\"f\">A race of intelligent, birdlike creatures living in the deepest deserts of Athas, the rare Athasian <a href=\"/appendix/aarakocr\">aarakocra</a> spends its time soaring on thermals in search of food.</p><p>The aarakocra is 7 to 8 feet tall with a wingspan of 20 feet or more. Because of its large wingspan, an aarakocra can carry as much as 75% of its own body weight and still fly easily. An aarakocra can fly a short distance carrying a burden equaling 125% of its own body weight. The average body weight of a full grown male is 100 pounds and a female is 85 pounds.</p><p>Each wing has a &ldquo;hand&rdquo; at its midpoint, consisting of three fingers and an opposable thumb. The fourth finger forms the rigid leading edge of the wing. In flight the hands cannot be used, but on the ground the aarakocra can use its hands almost as a human would. The aarakocra's body is protected by a thin bony plate on the chest, much like a solid rib cage. Talons on its legs can be used as claws and can be retracted to reveal a second set of hands, also with three fingers and an opposable thumb. Except for the chest plate, the entire skeleton is hollow and extremely fragile.</p><p>From a distance, the Athasian aarakocra resembles a huge <a href=\"/appendix/bird\">vulture</a>. Its black eyes, set in the front of the head, provide excellent vision over a long range. The plumage is generally black with a white collar for adult males and black or brown with a smaller white collar for females. Adolescents are a mixture of brown and black. The beak is large and covers most of the head. Plumage begins at the crown of the head and is darker near the head, except for the collar. Athasian aarakocra speak their own language and the languages of vultures and other large birds. Some speak the common tongue (5% to 10% chance depending on how deep in the wastelands a tribe lives).</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Combat:</b> Aarakocra can fight in the air or on the ground. They prefer aerial combat since their bones are too fragile to withstand a solid blow from a human-sized opponent. In combat against creatures on the ground, they prefer to fly over their victim and drop weighted nets. Some aarakocra use darts to harass ground-based opponents.</p><p>If their opponents can fly, the aarakocra generally forgo the use of the net, although large groups sometimes use nets on flying creatures. Normally, aarakocra attack flying creatures with long spears, diving from above and allowing the momentum to carry the spear through the target. Such an attack doubles the damage if the aarakocra have been able to dive at least 50 feet. Only the very largest aarakocra can carry more than one of these spears, they can attack with both at once with no penalty, causing double damage on each strike. All diving attacks are made at +4 and should be treated as a charge attack. All other penalties and restrictions of charge attacks apply.</p><p>The effect of the aarakocra's nets depends on if the opponent is flying at the time it becomes entangled. Creatures on the ground that are hit by a net are entangled and unable to participate in any combat until they make a successful Strength check to get free of the net. Flying creatures hit by a net can no longer fly and immediately begin falling. If they cannot escape the net or use some magical means to arrest the fall, normal falling damage applies.</p><p>Unless victims are entangled in nets, aarakocra are cautious in ground combat. If the aarakocra outnumber their opponents they advance in a straight line and thrust with their spears. If outnumbered, or the opponents are particularly tough, the aarakocra withdraw. Victims entangled in nets are killed or incapacitated for use as food or ransom.</p><p>Athasian aarakocra are mindful of their physical limitations as well as their comparatively low psionic abilities. They do not normally initiate psionic combat. At the first sign of psionic powers from any of their victims, however, all aarakocra that have some ability will use whatever attack and defense modes they can in an attempt to destroy the threat. Large groups of is or more aarakocra may initiate psionic combat if their leaders feel they can win quickly and avoid physical combat.</p><p>In desperation, an aarakocra can attempt to bite an opponent in combat. Because of the unwieldiness of its beak, the aarakocra has a THAC0 of 18 if attacking with this appendage. Further, the birdman causes only 1d2 points of damage with the beak.</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Habitat/Society:</b> Athasian aarakocra live in tribes with 6-20 (2d8+4) members, depending on the prestige of the leader. The largest tribe ever recorded had 50 members. The tribal hunting territory depends on the size of the tribe, usually about 500 square miles for a tribe of 10 members. There are no rigid boundaries between tribes and border disputes are not uncommon.</p><p>Alignments of tribe members are similar to the alignment of the leader. A tribe that has a leader who is neutral good may have neutral good, chaotic good, lawful good, and true neutral members. A predominantly evil tribe does not recognize boundaries with other tribes and treats other tribes as inferior beings to be eliminated.</p><p>Athasian aarakocra aren't happy in enclosed spaces, but they they take refuge in a cave or building if necessary.</p><p>Nonevil tribes live in rocky aeries in the highest peaks they can find. Evil tribes are normally nomadic and use an aerie made by another tribe if they need to remain in an area for a long time, even if they have to evict the tribe that made the nest.</p><p>Aarakocra aren't friendly toward intruders in their territory, especially caravans. They try to extract a toll from the caravan for passage through the desert. Good-aligned tribes allow unhindered passage of caravans that pay a tribute. If someone refuses to pay the tribute, the aarakocra try to capture scouts or outriders from the party and hold them until an even larger tribute is paid. The payment may be either livestock or shiny objects. Aarakocra are smart enough not to be taken in by glass baubles instead of gems, although they cannot tell the difference between the more common gems and the rare ones.</p><p>Evil tribes ask for tribute and often attack a caravan whether it pays or not. Aarakocra always demand shiny objects such as stones. These tribes find humans and demihumans to be quite tasty and prefer them to other food.</p><p>Good-aligned tribes of aarakocra sometimes return a lost traveler to the edge of the desert after first removing any valuables the traveler may be carrying. On very rare occasions a tribe might return a lost group of travelers to the more frequently traveled parts of the desert, again after first taking any valuables as payment.</p><p>The oldest male is the leader of the tribal hunting party and has 4+4 Hit Dice. The oldest female is in charge of the tribal aerie and has 3+3 HD. In tribes that have more than 15 members, the next oldest aarakocra serves as shaman and has 3+3 HD; the shaman completes the triumvirate necessary for proper worship and the summoning of elementals. (Interestingly, no magic-using aarakocra has ever been recorded.) Tribes without a shaman cannot summon <a href=\"/appendix/element1\">air elementals</a>, which is an important part of aarakocra culture.</p><p>The shaman is the leader of the daily sun worship. Aarakocra worship the sun because it provides them with the thermals they need to soar in search of food. The shaman also leads the mystic rituals used to summon an air elemental. Summoning an air elemental is usually done only in preparation for the tribe's most sacred ceremony, the hunt. Small tribes must band together for this ceremony to allow the triumvirate to be formed.</p><p>The ceremony to summon an air elemental must be conducted at dawn and requires the oldest male and female to emit a highpitched keening whistle. The shaman conducts an intricate dance around them, simultaneously chanting an ancient summoning mantra.</p><p>The hunt is the final part of the initiation of adolescent aarakocra to adulthood and often takes the tribe far from their normal teritory. The target is always a <a href=\"/appendix/drakalsi\">silt drake</a>. The hunt is the only time the females leave the relative safety of the nest. Even an evil tribe will not interfere with a tribe on a hunt. An air elemental is often summoned to help find the drake, but never takes part in the actual combat. Although the adult members of the tribe take part in the initial phases of the combat, it is the initiates who deliver the final, killing blows to me drake. Scars from the hunt are considered a mark of pride among all aarakocra.</p><p>The females spend about eight months of the year incubating their eggs. Athasian aarakocra mate for life and a pair normally produces as many as 10 offspring. A female lays one egg a year. Constant incubation is not required because of the high daytime temperatures, so the females can maintain the nest and keep the tribe's treasure in order.</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Ecology:</b> Athasian aarakocra are high on the food chain and have no natural enemies other than <a href=\"/appendix/drakatha\">drakes</a>. Unless evil, aarakocra leave their own territory only to hunt the silt drake and return as soon as possible when the hunt is over. (Evil aarakocra attack others, as noted above.) Aarakocra eggs and hatchlings are sought after by wealthy land owners who wish to use the creatures as scouts and sentries. An egg can bring as much as 10 cp in Tyr's marketplace. Tribes that have had eggs or hatchlings stolen have long memories and sometimes take revenge against the thief at a later date. Captive aarakocra join any tribe they come in contact with.</p><p>Athasian aarakocra have a natural life span of 21-30 years.</p><p></p><br clear=\"all\" style=\"clear:both; height:0;\">\r\n","images":["<img src=\"grf/ds.gif\" width=\"150\" height=\"75\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Dark Sun\" title=\"Dark Sun\" align=\"right\">","<img src=\"img/aarakath.gif\" alt=\"Aarakocra (Athas)\" title=\"Aarakocra (Athas)\" border=\"0\" width=\"300\" height=\"360\" style=\"text-align:right;\" align=\"right\">","<img src=\"grf/add2_01.gif\" width=\"200\" height=\"56\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Advanced Dungeons & Dragons 2nd Edition\">"],"setting":"Dark Sun","statblock":{"Aarakocra (Athas)":{"Activity Cycle":"Day","Alignment":"Any","Armor Class":"7","Climate/Terrain":"Deep desert","Damage/Attack":"1d3/1d3 or by weapon","Diet":"Carnivore","Frequency":"Rare","Hit Dice":"2+2","Intelligence":"Average (8-10)","Magic Resistance":"Nil","Morale":"Steady (11)","Movement":"6, Fl 36 (C)","No. Appearing":"1d10","No. of Attacks":"2","Organization":"Tribal","Size":"M (20'+ wingspan)","Special Attacks":"Nil","Special Defenses":"Nil","THAC0":"17","Treasure":"Varies","XP Value":"65"}},"title":"Aarakocra (Athas)"},"sources":["2433"],"statblock_names":[],"title":"Aarakocra (Athas)","prev_key":"zygraat","next_key":"aarakocr","monster_path":"/appendix/aarakath"}}},"pageContext":{"monster_key":"sandbrid","monster_data":{"TSR":["2405"],"fullBody":"  <table cellspacing=\"0\" cellpadding=\"0\"><tr class=\"bk\"><th> </th><th class=\"cn\">Sand Bride</th><th class=\"cn\">Sand Mother</th></tr><tr><th>Climate/Terrain:</th><td>Sandy wastes</td><td>Sandy wastes</td></tr><tr><th>Frequency:</th><td>Rare</td><td>Very rare</td></tr><tr><th>Organization:</th><td>Solitary</td><td>Solitary</td></tr><tr><th>Activity Cycle:</th><td>Night</td><td>Night</td></tr><tr><th>Diet:</th><td>Special</td><td>Special</td></tr><tr><th>Intelligence:</th><td>Average (8-10)</td><td>Very (11-12)</td></tr><tr><th>Treasure:</th><td>C</td><td>B,W</td></tr><tr><th>Alignment:</th><td>Chaotic evil</td><td>Chaotic evil</td></tr><tr><th>No. Appearing:</th><td>1</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><th>Armor Class:</th><td>0</td><td>-1</td></tr><tr><th>Movement:</th><td>24, Br 12</td><td>24, Br 12</td></tr><tr><th>Hit Dice:</th><td>7</td><td>9</td></tr><tr><th>THAC0:</th><td>13</td><td>11</td></tr><tr><th>No. of Attacks:</th><td>2</td><td>2</td></tr><tr><th>Damage/Attack:</th><td>1-10/1-10</td><td>1-12/1-12</td></tr><tr><th>Special Attacks:</th><td>Energy Drain</td><td>Energy Drain</td></tr><tr><th>Special Defenses:</th><td>See below</td><td>See below</td></tr><tr><th>Magic Resistance:</th><td>Nil</td><td>Nil</td></tr><tr><th>Size:</th><td>M (6' tall)</td><td>M (6' tall)</td></tr><tr><th>Morale:</th><td>Champion (15-16)</td><td>Champion (15-16)</td></tr><tr><th>XP Value:</th><td>3,000</td><td>5,000</td></tr></table><p class=\"f\">The sand bride is a negative material plane creature trapped on Athas. It uses its powers of illusion to lure victims to a cold death. The sand bride usually creates the illusion of an oasis, with itself as a beautiful woman (or more rarely, a man). It feeds on the life force of intelligent beings.</p><p>The sand bride is made entirely of sand. It has a humanoid shape and two glowing red eyes.</p><p>Sand brides speak a small number (1d6) of human or demihuman languages.</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Combat:</b> A sand bride has a burning hatred for intelligent creatures, but it is tempered with a high degree of cunning. Sand brides can move through the sand at their normal movement rate, and use this ability to scout out prospective victims in the area. A sand bride is intelligent enough to recognize a party with water trouble. Such a party is almost certain to be targeted. Only if the party is large and well-provisioned will a sand bride leave them alone. One of the sand bride's favorite ploys is to wait until someone is lagging behind the party. This being then comes upon an oasis where he expected to find none. This might seem suspicious, but to a man dying of thirst, a pool of water overcomes many misgivings.</p><p>The sand bride attempts to lure victims in; when they are refreshing themselves at the illusionary pool, it drops its illusion and seeks to attack with surprise.</p><p>The sand bride has the ability to cast <i>hallucinatory terrain</i> once a day and a <i>seeming</i> spell twice a day. These spells are cast at 10th level. It always uses these spells to cover its own appearance and the appearance of its surroundings. The oasis illusion is almost perfect; only druids and rangers of greater than 5th level are allowed a saving throw to disbelieve. The <i>seeming</i> spell is also very good (saving throws to disbelieve are at a penalty of -2). If a victim can be lured into an illusory oasis, the bride invites him to refresh himself. When the prey is bent over drinking, the sand bride drops the illusion and attacks, receiving a +4 attack roll bonus on the first attack.</p><p>Anyone who converses with a sand bride has a chance to notice that something is wrong. For every round spent in conversation with a sand bride, a being is allowed a saving throw to disbelieve. Sand brides are not very good at making polite conversation. Most of their information is out of date or just plain wrong. However, a sand bride's first suggestion is almost always &ldquo;have a drink, then we can talk&rdquo;. It tries to attack while the unsuspecting victim is filling its mouth with sand.</p><p>A being who believes the sand bride, and tries to drink, has other problems besides the sand bride to contend with. For one thing, his mouth and throat are coated with sand. Until he can spend a round washing the sand out, he attacks and defends at a penalty of -2. Also, casting spells with verbal components cannot be done.</p><p>Since the sand bride is made entirely of sand, swords and spears pass right through it. Only enchanted weapons do any real damage; other weapons just spray a bit of sand around. But, the sand bride will act as though a regular weapon causes damage, even falling back for a round to further the illusion. It tries to keep opponents from finding out its weakness, but clever parties may notice that it does not get any smaller as it takes damage. Only magic weapons can permanently destroy a sand bride. Regular water is harmful to them, but not permanently. Each gallon splashed on a sand bride causes 1d6 points of damage. This damage is temporary, and the sand bride reforms after a day. If the damage is caused by a combination of magical weapons and water, the sand bride still reforms in 24 hours.</p><p>In melee the sand bride attacks with its two powerful arms. Each causes 1d10 points of damage and drains one level. A creature drained of all of its life force by a sand bride becomes a dried-out husk. In two days time the husk dissolves into sand and dust, and the victim is irrecoverable by any means short of a <i>wish</i>. Before that, a combination of <i>remove curse</i> and <i>raise dead</i> spells will return the victim to life, but with no memories of his earlier life (including a total loss of experience points). Memories can be regained only by the use of a properly worded <i>wish</i>.</p><p>If a battle is going badly for a sand bride, it can just melt into the sand, taking one round to disappear completely. If the opponents do not immediately leave the area, the sand bride may (50% chance) rise up from the sand behind someone and attack again.</p><p>A sand bride fears nothing, though it has been suggested that they constantly search for someone who can kill them, to send them back to their dark plane. This is contradicted by the cunning they use in their attacks, including letting large parties go unmolested. Still, the sand bride is as likely to masquerade as a (short) female giant as a human. Anything with at least low intelligence is potential prey to a sand bride.</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Habitat/Society:</b> Sand brides are solitary creatures, having no contact with others of their kind. They are creatures trapped here, and they suffer as much as their victims, if not more. They were trapped here when a defiler opened a rift to the negative material plane.</p><p>A sand bride roams a considerable territory, its boundaries limited only by the sand. Sand brides do not like to cross areas other than sand. They can cross silt, but their movement rate is halved. They will not move across other types of terrain. A sand bride's lair is usually well hidden in a pocket beneath the sand. And though they have no use for them, sand brides lust after the possessions of men. Therefore, a sand bride's treasure has twice the normal chance to contain magical items, and three times the chance to contain gems.</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Ecology:</b> The sand bride has no natural enemies. They prey on anyone they can, seeming to know no limit to their lust for life force. They are especially fond of the life force of preservers.</p><h2><img src=\"/img/spc/sandmoth.gif\" width=\"300\" height=\"360\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Sand Mother\" alt=\"Sand Mother\" style=\"float:left;\">Sand Mother</h2><p class=\"f\">A sand mother, or mother of the bride, is a very old and powerful version of the sand bride. Its normal appearance is identical to that of the sand bride. It is not known if the sand mother is a unique creature or if a sand bride can somehow evolve into a sand mother.</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Combat:</b> The mother of the bride uses the same illusionary powers as the sand bride. Instead of appearing as a beautiful young lady, it chooses to appear as an older, motherly type of creature. The matronly figure welcomes thirsty adventurers, offering to care for them until they are recovered. A sand mother has learned about its weakness in conversation and has developed the ability to mask it. It does this by showing plenty of concern for the &ldquo;dear young ones&rdquo; of the party.</p><p>The sand mother is very intelligent, it does not attack until conditions are favorable. Before attacking, it tries to discover if anyone is carrying any magical weapons or if there is a preserver in the party. The sand mother always tries to attack the most dangerous member of the party first, with surprise if possible.</p><p>Sand mothers cast their illusions at 12th level, and they are very well crafted. Only a druid or ranger of 7th level or higher is allowed a chance to disbelieve the <i>hallucinatory terrain</i>, and the <i>seeming</i> spell has a -4 penalty to disbelieve.</p><p>A sand mother's oasis is always chosen with care. If it can find a pit or sinkhole, it uses that as the center of its <i>hallucinatory terrain</i>. Dangerous opponents can then be pushed in while they are drinking. If an opponent is kneeling and &ldquo;drinking&rdquo;, a successful attack roll for the sand mother automatically pushes the unsuspecting victim in. The victim takes falling damage in addition to the damage for the attack.</p><p>In melee the sand mother attacks twice with her powerful fists of sand. Each attack causes 1d12 points of damage and drains one level. Once engaged in melee, the sand mother fights intelligently. It can divide its attacks between two opponents, if they are next to each other. Like the sand bride, it only takes permanent damage from magical weapons, but against the sand mother, these weapons must have at least a +2 bonus. If brought to zero hit points by magical weapons of +1 or less, it reforms in one day. Normal water does no damage to a sand mother.</p><p>Sand mothers possess an additional power - the ability to cast a <i>destroy water</i> (reversed create water), as a 9th-level priest, once per day. This destroys up to 4½ gallons of water with each use. The sand mother, after trailing a party, will typically use this power against the party as it runs short of water.</p><p>The sand bride's hatred for preservers is shared by the sand mother. It always attacks if a preserver is present and usually portrays itself as very interested in the &ldquo;good mages&rdquo;. It is intelligent enough to know that magic is very dangerous to it, so it usually attacks a preserver first. If the party splits up and runs away, the preserver is still the one the sand mother pursues.</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Habitat/Society:</b> The sand mother usually resides in a cave deep under the sand. It collects magical items and gems, and a sand mother's treasure is sure to be a valuable one. There is double the normal chance for any magic item, meaning that there is always a magical item in the treasure. This item may very well be useless, particularly if it is a potion or something that does not age well. Finding a sand mother's lair may be an adventure by itself and should never be easy.</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Ecology:</b> The sand mother's lust for life force exceeds even that of the sand bride. It much prefers intelligent life force, but beasts will be drained of all life, if nothing better is available.</p><p></p><br clear=\"all\" style=\"clear:both; height:0;\">\r\n","images":["<img src=\"grf/ds.gif\" width=\"150\" height=\"75\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Dark Sun\" title=\"Dark Sun\" align=\"right\">","<img src=\"img/sandbrid.gif\" alt=\"Sand Bride\" title=\"Sand Bride\" border=\"0\" width=\"300\" height=\"360\" style=\"text-align:right;\" align=\"right\">","<img src=\"/img/spc/sandmoth.gif\" width=\"300\" height=\"360\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Sand Mother\" alt=\"Sand Mother\" style=\"float:left;\">","<img src=\"grf/add2_01.gif\" width=\"200\" height=\"56\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Advanced Dungeons & Dragons 2nd Edition\">"],"setting":"Dark Sun","statblock":{"Sand Bride":{"Activity Cycle":"Night","Alignment":"Chaotic evil","Armor Class":"0","Climate/Terrain":"Sandy wastes","Damage/Attack":"1-10/1-10","Diet":"Special","Frequency":"Rare","Hit Dice":"7","Intelligence":"Average (8-10)","Magic Resistance":"Nil","Morale":"Champion (15-16)","Movement":"24, Br 12","No. Appearing":"1","No. of Attacks":"2","Organization":"Solitary","Size":"M (6' tall)","Special Attacks":"Energy Drain","Special Defenses":"See below","THAC0":"13","Treasure":"C","XP Value":"3,000"},"Sand Mother":{"Activity Cycle":"Night","Alignment":"Chaotic evil","Armor Class":"-1","Climate/Terrain":"Sandy wastes","Damage/Attack":"1-12/1-12","Diet":"Special","Frequency":"Very rare","Hit Dice":"9","Intelligence":"Very (11-12)","Magic Resistance":"Nil","Morale":"Champion (15-16)","Movement":"24, Br 12","No. Appearing":"1","No. of Attacks":"2","Organization":"Solitary","Size":"M (6' tall)","Special Attacks":"Energy Drain","Special Defenses":"See below","THAC0":"11","Treasure":"B,W","XP Value":"5,000"}},"title":"Sand Bride"},"sources":["2405"],"statblock_names":[],"title":"Sand Bride","prev_key":"sakina","next_key":"sandcact","monster_path":"/appendix/sandbrid"}},"staticQueryHashes":[],"slicesMap":{}}
