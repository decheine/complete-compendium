While the powers listed above are the most common, some aarakocra have different or additional powers.</p><p class=\"f\">A race of intelligent, birdlike creatures living in the deepest deserts of Athas, the rare Athasian <a href=\"/appendix/aarakocr\">aarakocra</a> spends its time soaring on thermals in search of food.</p><p>The aarakocra is 7 to 8 feet tall with a wingspan of 20 feet or more. Because of its large wingspan, an aarakocra can carry as much as 75% of its own body weight and still fly easily. An aarakocra can fly a short distance carrying a burden equaling 125% of its own body weight. The average body weight of a full grown male is 100 pounds and a female is 85 pounds.</p><p>Each wing has a &ldquo;hand&rdquo; at its midpoint, consisting of three fingers and an opposable thumb. The fourth finger forms the rigid leading edge of the wing. In flight the hands cannot be used, but on the ground the aarakocra can use its hands almost as a human would. The aarakocra's body is protected by a thin bony plate on the chest, much like a solid rib cage. Talons on its legs can be used as claws and can be retracted to reveal a second set of hands, also with three fingers and an opposable thumb. Except for the chest plate, the entire skeleton is hollow and extremely fragile.</p><p>From a distance, the Athasian aarakocra resembles a huge <a href=\"/appendix/bird\">vulture</a>. Its black eyes, set in the front of the head, provide excellent vision over a long range. The plumage is generally black with a white collar for adult males and black or brown with a smaller white collar for females. Adolescents are a mixture of brown and black. The beak is large and covers most of the head. Plumage begins at the crown of the head and is darker near the head, except for the collar. Athasian aarakocra speak their own language and the languages of vultures and other large birds. Some speak the common tongue (5% to 10% chance depending on how deep in the wastelands a tribe lives).</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Combat:</b> Aarakocra can fight in the air or on the ground. They prefer aerial combat since their bones are too fragile to withstand a solid blow from a human-sized opponent. In combat against creatures on the ground, they prefer to fly over their victim and drop weighted nets. Some aarakocra use darts to harass ground-based opponents.</p><p>If their opponents can fly, the aarakocra generally forgo the use of the net, although large groups sometimes use nets on flying creatures. Normally, aarakocra attack flying creatures with long spears, diving from above and allowing the momentum to carry the spear through the target. Such an attack doubles the damage if the aarakocra have been able to dive at least 50 feet. Only the very largest aarakocra can carry more than one of these spears, they can attack with both at once with no penalty, causing double damage on each strike. All diving attacks are made at +4 and should be treated as a charge attack. All other penalties and restrictions of charge attacks apply.</p><p>The effect of the aarakocra's nets depends on if the opponent is flying at the time it becomes entangled. Creatures on the ground that are hit by a net are entangled and unable to participate in any combat until they make a successful Strength check to get free of the net. Flying creatures hit by a net can no longer fly and immediately begin falling. If they cannot escape the net or use some magical means to arrest the fall, normal falling damage applies.</p><p>Unless victims are entangled in nets, aarakocra are cautious in ground combat. If the aarakocra outnumber their opponents they advance in a straight line and thrust with their spears. If outnumbered, or the opponents are particularly tough, the aarakocra withdraw. Victims entangled in nets are killed or incapacitated for use as food or ransom.</p><p>Athasian aarakocra are mindful of their physical limitations as well as their comparatively low psionic abilities. They do not normally initiate psionic combat. At the first sign of psionic powers from any of their victims, however, all aarakocra that have some ability will use whatever attack and defense modes they can in an attempt to destroy the threat. Large groups of is or more aarakocra may initiate psionic combat if their leaders feel they can win quickly and avoid physical combat.</p><p>In desperation, an aarakocra can attempt to bite an opponent in combat. Because of the unwieldiness of its beak, the aarakocra has a THAC0 of 18 if attacking with this appendage. Further, the birdman causes only 1d2 points of damage with the beak.</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Habitat/Society:</b> Athasian aarakocra live in tribes with 6-20 (2d8+4) members, depending on the prestige of the leader. The largest tribe ever recorded had 50 members. The tribal hunting territory depends on the size of the tribe, usually about 500 square miles for a tribe of 10 members. There are no rigid boundaries between tribes and border disputes are not uncommon.</p><p>Alignments of tribe members are similar to the alignment of the leader. A tribe that has a leader who is neutral good may have neutral good, chaotic good, lawful good, and true neutral members. A predominantly evil tribe does not recognize boundaries with other tribes and treats other tribes as inferior beings to be eliminated.</p><p>Athasian aarakocra aren't happy in enclosed spaces, but they they take refuge in a cave or building if necessary.</p><p>Nonevil tribes live in rocky aeries in the highest peaks they can find. Evil tribes are normally nomadic and use an aerie made by another tribe if they need to remain in an area for a long time, even if they have to evict the tribe that made the nest.</p><p>Aarakocra aren't friendly toward intruders in their territory, especially caravans. They try to extract a toll from the caravan for passage through the desert. Good-aligned tribes allow unhindered passage of caravans that pay a tribute. If someone refuses to pay the tribute, the aarakocra try to capture scouts or outriders from the party and hold them until an even larger tribute is paid. The payment may be either livestock or shiny objects. Aarakocra are smart enough not to be taken in by glass baubles instead of gems, although they cannot tell the difference between the more common gems and the rare ones.</p><p>Evil tribes ask for tribute and often attack a caravan whether it pays or not. Aarakocra always demand shiny objects such as stones. These tribes find humans and demihumans to be quite tasty and prefer them to other food.</p><p>Good-aligned tribes of aarakocra sometimes return a lost traveler to the edge of the desert after first removing any valuables the traveler may be carrying. On very rare occasions a tribe might return a lost group of travelers to the more frequently traveled parts of the desert, again after first taking any valuables as payment.</p><p>The oldest male is the leader of the tribal hunting party and has 4+4 Hit Dice. The oldest female is in charge of the tribal aerie and has 3+3 HD. In tribes that have more than 15 members, the next oldest aarakocra serves as shaman and has 3+3 HD; the shaman completes the triumvirate necessary for proper worship and the summoning of elementals. (Interestingly, no magic-using aarakocra has ever been recorded.) Tribes without a shaman cannot summon <a href=\"/appendix/element1\">air elementals</a>, which is an important part of aarakocra culture.</p><p>The shaman is the leader of the daily sun worship. Aarakocra worship the sun because it provides them with the thermals they need to soar in search of food. The shaman also leads the mystic rituals used to summon an air elemental. Summoning an air elemental is usually done only in preparation for the tribe's most sacred ceremony, the hunt. Small tribes must band together for this ceremony to allow the triumvirate to be formed.</p><p>The ceremony to summon an air elemental must be conducted at dawn and requires the oldest male and female to emit a highpitched keening whistle. The shaman conducts an intricate dance around them, simultaneously chanting an ancient summoning mantra.</p><p>The hunt is the final part of the initiation of adolescent aarakocra to adulthood and often takes the tribe far from their normal teritory. The target is always a <a href=\"/appendix/drakalsi\">silt drake</a>. The hunt is the only time the females leave the relative safety of the nest. Even an evil tribe will not interfere with a tribe on a hunt. An air elemental is often summoned to help find the drake, but never takes part in the actual combat. Although the adult members of the tribe take part in the initial phases of the combat, it is the initiates who deliver the final, killing blows to me drake. Scars from the hunt are considered a mark of pride among all aarakocra.</p><p>The females spend about eight months of the year incubating their eggs. Athasian aarakocra mate for life and a pair normally produces as many as 10 offspring. A female lays one egg a year. Constant incubation is not required because of the high daytime temperatures, so the females can maintain the nest and keep the tribe's treasure in order.</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Ecology:</b> Athasian aarakocra are high on the food chain and have no natural enemies other than <a href=\"/appendix/drakatha\">drakes</a>. Unless evil, aarakocra leave their own territory only to hunt the silt drake and return as soon as possible when the hunt is over. (Evil aarakocra attack others, as noted above.) Aarakocra eggs and hatchlings are sought after by wealthy land owners who wish to use the creatures as scouts and sentries. An egg can bring as much as 10 cp in Tyr's marketplace. Tribes that have had eggs or hatchlings stolen have long memories and sometimes take revenge against the thief at a later date. Captive aarakocra join any tribe they come in contact with.</p><p>Athasian aarakocra have a natural life span of 21-30 years.</p>\n","images":["<img src=\"grf/ds.gif\" width=\"150\" height=\"75\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Dark Sun\" title=\"Dark Sun\" align=\"right\">","<img src=\"img/aarakath.gif\" alt=\"Aarakocra (Athas)\" title=\"Aarakocra (Athas)\" border=\"0\" width=\"300\" height=\"360\" style=\"text-align:right;\" align=\"right\">","<img src=\"grf/add2_01.gif\" width=\"200\" height=\"56\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Advanced Dungeons & Dragons 2nd Edition\">"],"setting":"Dark Sun","statblock":{"Aarakocra (Athas)":{"Activity Cycle":"Day","Alignment":"Any","Armor Class":"7","Climate/Terrain":"Deep desert","Damage/Attack":"1d3/1d3 or by weapon","Diet":"Carnivore","Frequency":"Rare","Hit Dice":"2+2","Intelligence":"Average (8-10)","Magic Resistance":"Nil","Morale":"Steady (11)","Movement":"6, Fl 36 (C)","No. Appearing":"1d10","No. of Attacks":"2","Organization":"Tribal","Size":"M (20'+ wingspan)","Special Attacks":"Nil","Special Defenses":"Nil","THAC0":"17","Treasure":"Varies","XP Value":"65"}},"title":"Aarakocra (Athas)"},"sources":["2433"],"statblock_names":[],"title":"Aarakocra (Athas)","prev_key":"zygraat","next_key":"aarakocr","monster_path":"/appendix/aarakath"}}},"pageContext":{"monster_key":"golesaco","monster_data":{"TSR":["2524"],"fullBody":"    <table cellspacing=\"0\" cellpadding=\"0\"><tr class=\"bk\"><th> </th><th class=\"cn\">Aelder<br>(lesser golem)</th><th class=\"cn\">Glassine Horror<br>(lesser golem)</th><th class=\"cn\">Golem, Red<br>(greater golem)</th><th class=\"cn\">Juggernaut, Hulean<br>(greater golem)</th></tr><tr><th>Climate/Terrain:</th><td>Mountains</td><td>Any</td><td>Any</td><td>Any settled</td></tr><tr><th>Frequency:</th><td>Rare</td><td>Very rare</td><td>Very rare</td><td>Very rare</td></tr><tr><th>Organization:</th><td>Solitary</td><td>Solitary</td><td>Solitary</td><td>Solitary</td></tr><tr><th>Activity Cycle:</th><td>Any</td><td>Any</td><td>Any</td><td>Any</td></tr><tr><th>Diet:</th><td>None</td><td>None</td><td>None</td><td>None</td></tr><tr><th>Intelligence:</th><td>Low (5-7)</td><td>Very (11-12)</td><td>Semi- (2-4)</td><td>Semi- (2-4)</td></tr><tr><th>Treasure:</th><td>Nil</td><td>Q(&times;4)</td><td>Nil</td><td>A (+)</td></tr><tr><th>Alignment:</th><td>Neutral</td><td>Lawful neutral</td><td>Neutral</td><td>Neutral</td></tr><tr><th>No. Appearing:</th><td>2</td><td>1 (1d6)</td><td>1</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><th>Armor Class:</th><td>3</td><td>2</td><td>1</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><th>Movement:</th><td>18</td><td>9, Fl 36</td><td>6</td><td>9</td></tr><tr><th>Hit Dice:</th><td>9 (60 hp)</td><td>8 (60 hp)</td><td>18 (90 hp)</td><td>30 (150 hp)</td></tr><tr><th>THAC0:</th><td>11</td><td>13</td><td>3</td><td>Special</td></tr><tr><th>No. of Attacks:</th><td>2</td><td>1</td><td>2</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><th>Damage/Attack:</th><td>2d6/2d6</td><td>2d10</td><td>2d12/2d12</td><td>10d10</td></tr><tr><th>Special Attacks:</th><td>Spells</td><td>Blinding, spells</td><td>Depletes cinnabryl</td><td>Crush</td></tr><tr><th>Special Defenses:</th><td>Near invisibility, spell immunities</td><td>See below</td><td>Need +2 weapon to hit, spell immunities</td><td>Spell immunities, special saves</td></tr><tr><th>Magic Resistance:</th><td>Nil</td><td>Nil</td><td>Nil</td><td>Nil</td></tr><tr><th>Size:</th><td>L (8' tall)</td><td>H (see below)</td><td>L (12' tall)</td><td>G (30'&times;40'&times;40')</td></tr><tr><th>Morale:</th><td>Fearless (19-20)</td><td>Average (8-10)</td><td>Fearless (19-20)</td><td>Elite (13-14)</td></tr><tr><th>XP Value:</th><td>2,000</td><td>4,000</td><td>14,000</td><td>21,000</td></tr></table><p class=\"f\">The Savage Coast offers some unique variations on the standard <a href=\"/appendix/golem\">golem</a> design, in both form and material. Standard golems are slowly giving way to the new forms.</p><h2><img src=\"/img/spc/golesaco.gif\" width=\"300\" height=\"360\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Aelder Golem\" title=\"Aelder Golem\" style=\"float:right;\">Aelder</h2><p class=\"f\">The <a href=\"/appendix/eeaar\">ee'aar</a> build these glassteel golems for the express purpose of guarding sacred burial places up in the high mountains. Only ee'aar priests can create them, and they are always constructed in pairs.</p><p>An aelder golem can be created in any of a dozen different forms - including a <a href=\"/appendix/spider\">spider</a>, <a href=\"/appendix/centaur\">centaur</a>, serpent, and <a href=\"/appendix/gargoyl1\">gargoyle</a>. The most common form chosen is a tall, slender spider. The eight segmented legs of this aelder rise 10 feet from the ground before slanting back down three feet to support the multifaceted body. The two forward legs end in pointed, serrated segments. Two spinnerets extend from the rear of the spider body.</p><p>Within the icy mountain reaches where the ee'aar make burial sites, the aelder golem is nearly impossible to see. Ranged attacks beyond 20 feet are impossible, and even up close, all opponents suffer a -2 penalty on anything but melee attacks. An aelder attacks with the end segments of its front legs, which act as piercing weapons and can strike targets up to 10 feet away.</p><p>Aelder are immune to any spells or spell effects which employ light or a gaze. These golems can invoke each of the spells <i>color spray</i>, <i>dancing lights</i>, and <i>hypnotic pattern</i> three times per day.</p><p>The spider golem can actually spin a web of glassteel, which is either applied thickly for concealment or spun so fine and brittle that it is essentially invisible. Attempting to walk through this web shatters it, alerting the aelder of intruders.</p><p>Aelder communicate with the ee'aar through a series of shrieks and screeches translatable only by priests. <a href=\"/appendix/mythfolk\">Mythuínn folk</a> are allowed to hide in aelder webs from predators, so long as they do not try to venture farther into the burial site.</p><h2>Glassine Horror</h2><p class=\"f\">Another construct of the ee'aar, the glassine horror was an attempt by ee'aar wizards to design a more intelligent golem. They succeeded only too well; the higher Intelligence brought with it a more independent spirit, including an inherent desire for self-preservation.</p><p>The glassine horror can assume three different forms. The first, from which it takes its name, is a sheet of crystalline substance with an area between 50 and 100 square feet (thickness varies from 1 to 6 inches). In this inactive state, it rests across a window or doorway until needed or until a trespasser is detected.</p><p>The second form is that of a roughly-shaped humanoid figure, approximately 15 feet tall and constructed of a scintillating, gemlike material. As light glistens off the facets, it produces a dazzling effect. All opponents within a 10-foot radius must make a successful saving throw vs. spell or suffer -2 attack penalties. Besides its devastating punch, this form has three magical abilities: <i>crystalbrittle</i>; <i>create sunburst</i> (as per <i>wand of illumination</i>); and <i>continual light</i>. In this form, the glassine horror is immune to any spell effects employing light or electricity.</p><p>The third form is a whirling cloud of glistening sand. This cloud can move at a speed of 36 but cannot rise more than five feet above any surface. Any creature caught within this 100 cubic-foot cloud (indicated by a successful attack roll) takes 2d8 points of damage and must make a successful saving throw vs. spell or be blinded for 2d4 turns. This form is immune to all &ldquo;wind&rdquo; spells.</p><p>Though loyal to its master, the glassine horror also possesses the need for self-preservation. It never fights to its destruction, fleeing if it ever falls below 10% of its starting hit points. As a reward for good service, this golem expects to be given gems, which it can use to heal damage. The glassine horror absorbs them, healing 1 hit point per 50 gp worth of gems. Rest also heals the golem.</p><p>Glassine horrors, if commanded by the wizard who created them, are encountered in groups of 1d6 golems. However, most are encountered singly, far from the ee'aar lands. A glassine horror whose master dies is considered a free entity, usually leaving the vicinity. These creatures enjoy working as guards and will serve loyally for the price of a few gems. A glassine horror will adopt a new master with the same guidelines as before: It will not let itself be destroyed, and it expects to be rewarded.</p><h2>Red Golem</h2><p class=\"f\">Red golems resemble <a href=\"/appendix/golem1\">iron golems</a>, but they are made entirely out of <i>red steel</i>. Also, these golems are tougher than the iron golem, while weighing only half as much (about 2500 pounds). These golems understand verbal commands and can even differentiate between opponents, attacking the most threatening one first.</p><p>A red golem attacks with two heavy punches (which must be aimed at the same opponent as long as that opponent is still standing). Red golems also radiate an aura that depletes <i>cinnabryl</i> within a 10-foot radius. The <i>cinnabryl</i> is depleted at a rate of one ounce per round, but this aura does not cause victims to enter the Time of Loss or Change. While red golems are immune to nonmagical weapons of less than +2 enchantment, weapons of less than +4 enchantment inflict only half damage. Magical electrical attacks merely <i>slow</i> red golems for 1d3 rounds, and magical fire actually heals 1 point of damage for each Hit Die of damage it was supposed to inflict. Red golems are immune to all other spells.</p><p>Red golems were also imbued with the ability to <i>taunt</i> their opponents (as per the wizard spell). When one of these golems is attacked with a nonmagical weapon or a spell that it is immune to, it uses this skill to mock its foes.</p><p>Red golems can also shapechange. A golem implements this ability only at the command of its master. By using this ability, the creature can alter its size and basic appearance. As its master wishes, the red golem can resemble a human or <a href=\"/appendix/ogrehalf\">demi-ogre</a> under a heavy cloak.</p><h2>Juggernaut, Hulean</h2><p class=\"f\">In pursuit of the ultimate war machine, the kingdom of Hule devised this <a href=\"/appendix/golem6\">juggernaut</a>. Only the wizards of Hule know how this construct is given life.</p><p>The Hulean juggernaut is a giant stone building built on a platform with huge, iron-banded wheels. Dimensions vary, but it usually stands about 30 feet wide, 40 feet high, and 40 feet long. Battlements and archer slits are both common features, allowing the juggernaut to carry humanoid soldiers and, thereby, increase its deadly power. Many are also affixed with a battering ram.</p><p>In combat, the juggernaut simply rolls over its opponents, crushing even small stone buildings beneath it. The battering ram demolishes things too large to simply roll over. The wide wheelbase allows the juggernaut to attack multiple targets at the same time. Anyone caught in front of this leviathan must make a successful saving throw vs. breath weapon to escape to the side or be crushed. Those inside the juggernaut can still attack those who manage to get out of its way. The juggernaut can stop, turn, or reverse in the space of one round, allowing it to attack creatures on any side from one round to the next.</p><p>The Hulean juggernaut is immune to magical and normal fire; <i>sleep</i>, <i>charm</i>, and <i>hold</i> spells; and nonmagical weapons. All of its saves succeed on 4 or better. Hulean juggernauts often have treasure inside them (as one of the safest places to store spoils of war), but the creature must be killed in order to gain entry. Only its master can command it to allow entrance.</p><p>The juggernaut's dependence on its master remains the weak point in its design. While the construct obeys simple verbal commands (like &ldquo;defend this area&rdquo;, &ldquo;attack that fortress&rdquo;, or &ldquo;destroy that army&rdquo;), it is still answerable only to its creator. If the juggernaut's master is killed, the creature may continue following its last orders indefinitely. Those inside are trapped, and the juggernaut could even turn on its own army now. Outside of Hule, juggernauts are most commonly found among ruins, waiting for further people and objects to crush.</p>\n","images":["<img src=\"grf/rs.gif\" width=\"150\" height=\"75\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Red Steel (Mystara)\" title=\"Red Steel (Mystara)\" align=\"right\">","<img src=\"/img/spc/golesaco.gif\" width=\"300\" height=\"360\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Aelder Golem\" title=\"Aelder Golem\" style=\"float:right;\">","<img src=\"grf/add2_01.gif\" width=\"200\" height=\"56\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Advanced Dungeons & Dragons 2nd Edition\">"],"setting":"Red Steel (Mystara)","statblock":{"Aelder<br>(lesser golem)":{"Activity Cycle":"Any","Alignment":"Neutral","Armor Class":"3","Climate/Terrain":"Mountains","Damage/Attack":"2d6/2d6","Diet":"None","Frequency":"Rare","Hit Dice":"9 (60 hp)","Intelligence":"Low (5-7)","Magic Resistance":"Nil","Morale":"Fearless (19-20)","Movement":"18","No. Appearing":"2","No. of Attacks":"2","Organization":"Solitary","Size":"L (8' tall)","Special Attacks":"Spells","Special Defenses":"Near invisibility, spell immunities","THAC0":"11","Treasure":"Nil","XP Value":"2,000"},"Glassine Horror<br>(lesser golem)":{"Activity Cycle":"Any","Alignment":"Lawful neutral","Armor Class":"2","Climate/Terrain":"Any","Damage/Attack":"2d10","Diet":"None","Frequency":"Very rare","Hit Dice":"8 (60 hp)","Intelligence":"Very (11-12)","Magic Resistance":"Nil","Morale":"Average (8-10)","Movement":"9, Fl 36","No. Appearing":"1 (1d6)","No. of Attacks":"1","Organization":"Solitary","Size":"H (see below)","Special Attacks":"Blinding, spells","Special Defenses":"See below","THAC0":"13","Treasure":"Q(&times;4)","XP Value":"4,000"},"Golem, Red<br>(greater golem)":{"Activity Cycle":"Any","Alignment":"Neutral","Armor Class":"1","Climate/Terrain":"Any","Damage/Attack":"2d12/2d12","Diet":"None","Frequency":"Very rare","Hit Dice":"18 (90 hp)","Intelligence":"Semi- (2-4)","Magic Resistance":"Nil","Morale":"Fearless (19-20)","Movement":"6","No. Appearing":"1","No. of Attacks":"2","Organization":"Solitary","Size":"L (12' tall)","Special Attacks":"Depletes cinnabryl","Special Defenses":"Need +2 weapon to hit, spell immunities","THAC0":"3","Treasure":"Nil","XP Value":"14,000"},"Juggernaut, Hulean<br>(greater golem)":{"Activity Cycle":"Any","Alignment":"Neutral","Armor Class":"0","Climate/Terrain":"Any settled","Damage/Attack":"10d10","Diet":"None","Frequency":"Very rare","Hit Dice":"30 (150 hp)","Intelligence":"Semi- (2-4)","Magic Resistance":"Nil","Morale":"Elite (13-14)","Movement":"9","No. Appearing":"1","No. of Attacks":"1","Organization":"Solitary","Size":"G (30'&times;40'&times;40')","Special Attacks":"Crush","Special Defenses":"Spell immunities, special saves","THAC0":"Special","Treasure":"A (+)","XP Value":"21,000"}},"title":"Golem (Savage Coast)"},"sources":["2524"],"statblock_names":[],"title":"Golem (Savage Coast)","prev_key":"golervwx","next_key":"goleshab","monster_path":"/appendix/golesaco"}},"staticQueryHashes":[],"slicesMap":{}}
