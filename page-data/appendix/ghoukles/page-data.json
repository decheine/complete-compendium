One such, it's said, subterraneously pursued the man whose house lay by a lich-field and took him in his own cellar.&rdquo;</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Combat:</b> Kleshite ghouls burrow underground, emerge unexpectedly beneath their victims, and attempt to drag them down to be consumed later. They automatically attack with surprise and cause paralysis as a normal ghoul. Victims of a Kleshite ghoul do not rise as <a href=\"/appendix/ghoul\">ghouls</a> themselves.</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Habitat/Society:</b> Kleshite ghouls live in chaotic packs, with the strongest getting the lion's share of any prey. These filthy creatures are not above consuming their own fellows if they get too hungry.</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Ecology:</b> Graveyard scavengers and predators, Kleshite ghouls are feared throughout the south of Nehwon. They serve no real ecological function and are exterminated wherever they are found.</p><br clear=\"all\" style=\"clear:both; height:0;\">\r\n","images":["<img src=\"grf/lm.gif\" width=\"150\" height=\"75\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Lankhmar\" title=\"Lankhmar\" align=\"right\">","<img src=\"img/ghoukles.gif\" alt=\" Ghoul, Kleshite\" title=\" Ghoul, Kleshite\" border=\"0\" width=\"300\" height=\"360\" style=\"text-align:right;\" align=\"right\">","<img src=\"grf/add2_01.gif\" width=\"200\" height=\"56\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Advanced Dungeons & Dragons 2nd Edition\">"],"setting":"Lankhmar","statblock":{" Ghoul, Kleshite":{"Activity Cycle":"Any","Alignment":"Chaotic evil","Armor Class":"5","Climate/Terrain":"Jungle (Klesh)","Damage/Attack":"1-4/1-4/1-8","Diet":"Carnivore","Frequency":"Rare","Hit Dice":"3","Intelligence":"Low (5-7)","Magic Resistance":"Nil","Morale":"Steady (11-12)","Movement":"12, Br 12","No. Appearing":"2-16","No. of Attacks":"3","Organization":"Pack","Size":"L (5-6' tall)","Special Attacks":"Paralyzation, surprise","Special Defenses":"Nil","THAC0":"17","Treasure":"B,V","XP Value":"270"}},"title":" Ghoul, Kleshite"},"sources":["2137"],"statblock_names":[],"title":" Ghoul, Kleshite","prev_key":"ghougoop","next_key":"ghoul"}},"staticQueryHashes":[],"slicesMap":{}}
