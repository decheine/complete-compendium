While the powers listed above are the most common, some aarakocra have different or additional powers.</p><p class=\"f\">A race of intelligent, birdlike creatures living in the deepest deserts of Athas, the rare Athasian <a href=\"/appendix/aarakocr\">aarakocra</a> spends its time soaring on thermals in search of food.</p><p>The aarakocra is 7 to 8 feet tall with a wingspan of 20 feet or more. Because of its large wingspan, an aarakocra can carry as much as 75% of its own body weight and still fly easily. An aarakocra can fly a short distance carrying a burden equaling 125% of its own body weight. The average body weight of a full grown male is 100 pounds and a female is 85 pounds.</p><p>Each wing has a &ldquo;hand&rdquo; at its midpoint, consisting of three fingers and an opposable thumb. The fourth finger forms the rigid leading edge of the wing. In flight the hands cannot be used, but on the ground the aarakocra can use its hands almost as a human would. The aarakocra's body is protected by a thin bony plate on the chest, much like a solid rib cage. Talons on its legs can be used as claws and can be retracted to reveal a second set of hands, also with three fingers and an opposable thumb. Except for the chest plate, the entire skeleton is hollow and extremely fragile.</p><p>From a distance, the Athasian aarakocra resembles a huge <a href=\"/appendix/bird\">vulture</a>. Its black eyes, set in the front of the head, provide excellent vision over a long range. The plumage is generally black with a white collar for adult males and black or brown with a smaller white collar for females. Adolescents are a mixture of brown and black. The beak is large and covers most of the head. Plumage begins at the crown of the head and is darker near the head, except for the collar. Athasian aarakocra speak their own language and the languages of vultures and other large birds. Some speak the common tongue (5% to 10% chance depending on how deep in the wastelands a tribe lives).</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Combat:</b> Aarakocra can fight in the air or on the ground. They prefer aerial combat since their bones are too fragile to withstand a solid blow from a human-sized opponent. In combat against creatures on the ground, they prefer to fly over their victim and drop weighted nets. Some aarakocra use darts to harass ground-based opponents.</p><p>If their opponents can fly, the aarakocra generally forgo the use of the net, although large groups sometimes use nets on flying creatures. Normally, aarakocra attack flying creatures with long spears, diving from above and allowing the momentum to carry the spear through the target. Such an attack doubles the damage if the aarakocra have been able to dive at least 50 feet. Only the very largest aarakocra can carry more than one of these spears, they can attack with both at once with no penalty, causing double damage on each strike. All diving attacks are made at +4 and should be treated as a charge attack. All other penalties and restrictions of charge attacks apply.</p><p>The effect of the aarakocra's nets depends on if the opponent is flying at the time it becomes entangled. Creatures on the ground that are hit by a net are entangled and unable to participate in any combat until they make a successful Strength check to get free of the net. Flying creatures hit by a net can no longer fly and immediately begin falling. If they cannot escape the net or use some magical means to arrest the fall, normal falling damage applies.</p><p>Unless victims are entangled in nets, aarakocra are cautious in ground combat. If the aarakocra outnumber their opponents they advance in a straight line and thrust with their spears. If outnumbered, or the opponents are particularly tough, the aarakocra withdraw. Victims entangled in nets are killed or incapacitated for use as food or ransom.</p><p>Athasian aarakocra are mindful of their physical limitations as well as their comparatively low psionic abilities. They do not normally initiate psionic combat. At the first sign of psionic powers from any of their victims, however, all aarakocra that have some ability will use whatever attack and defense modes they can in an attempt to destroy the threat. Large groups of is or more aarakocra may initiate psionic combat if their leaders feel they can win quickly and avoid physical combat.</p><p>In desperation, an aarakocra can attempt to bite an opponent in combat. Because of the unwieldiness of its beak, the aarakocra has a THAC0 of 18 if attacking with this appendage. Further, the birdman causes only 1d2 points of damage with the beak.</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Habitat/Society:</b> Athasian aarakocra live in tribes with 6-20 (2d8+4) members, depending on the prestige of the leader. The largest tribe ever recorded had 50 members. The tribal hunting territory depends on the size of the tribe, usually about 500 square miles for a tribe of 10 members. There are no rigid boundaries between tribes and border disputes are not uncommon.</p><p>Alignments of tribe members are similar to the alignment of the leader. A tribe that has a leader who is neutral good may have neutral good, chaotic good, lawful good, and true neutral members. A predominantly evil tribe does not recognize boundaries with other tribes and treats other tribes as inferior beings to be eliminated.</p><p>Athasian aarakocra aren't happy in enclosed spaces, but they they take refuge in a cave or building if necessary.</p><p>Nonevil tribes live in rocky aeries in the highest peaks they can find. Evil tribes are normally nomadic and use an aerie made by another tribe if they need to remain in an area for a long time, even if they have to evict the tribe that made the nest.</p><p>Aarakocra aren't friendly toward intruders in their territory, especially caravans. They try to extract a toll from the caravan for passage through the desert. Good-aligned tribes allow unhindered passage of caravans that pay a tribute. If someone refuses to pay the tribute, the aarakocra try to capture scouts or outriders from the party and hold them until an even larger tribute is paid. The payment may be either livestock or shiny objects. Aarakocra are smart enough not to be taken in by glass baubles instead of gems, although they cannot tell the difference between the more common gems and the rare ones.</p><p>Evil tribes ask for tribute and often attack a caravan whether it pays or not. Aarakocra always demand shiny objects such as stones. These tribes find humans and demihumans to be quite tasty and prefer them to other food.</p><p>Good-aligned tribes of aarakocra sometimes return a lost traveler to the edge of the desert after first removing any valuables the traveler may be carrying. On very rare occasions a tribe might return a lost group of travelers to the more frequently traveled parts of the desert, again after first taking any valuables as payment.</p><p>The oldest male is the leader of the tribal hunting party and has 4+4 Hit Dice. The oldest female is in charge of the tribal aerie and has 3+3 HD. In tribes that have more than 15 members, the next oldest aarakocra serves as shaman and has 3+3 HD; the shaman completes the triumvirate necessary for proper worship and the summoning of elementals. (Interestingly, no magic-using aarakocra has ever been recorded.) Tribes without a shaman cannot summon <a href=\"/appendix/element1\">air elementals</a>, which is an important part of aarakocra culture.</p><p>The shaman is the leader of the daily sun worship. Aarakocra worship the sun because it provides them with the thermals they need to soar in search of food. The shaman also leads the mystic rituals used to summon an air elemental. Summoning an air elemental is usually done only in preparation for the tribe's most sacred ceremony, the hunt. Small tribes must band together for this ceremony to allow the triumvirate to be formed.</p><p>The ceremony to summon an air elemental must be conducted at dawn and requires the oldest male and female to emit a highpitched keening whistle. The shaman conducts an intricate dance around them, simultaneously chanting an ancient summoning mantra.</p><p>The hunt is the final part of the initiation of adolescent aarakocra to adulthood and often takes the tribe far from their normal teritory. The target is always a <a href=\"/appendix/drakalsi\">silt drake</a>. The hunt is the only time the females leave the relative safety of the nest. Even an evil tribe will not interfere with a tribe on a hunt. An air elemental is often summoned to help find the drake, but never takes part in the actual combat. Although the adult members of the tribe take part in the initial phases of the combat, it is the initiates who deliver the final, killing blows to me drake. Scars from the hunt are considered a mark of pride among all aarakocra.</p><p>The females spend about eight months of the year incubating their eggs. Athasian aarakocra mate for life and a pair normally produces as many as 10 offspring. A female lays one egg a year. Constant incubation is not required because of the high daytime temperatures, so the females can maintain the nest and keep the tribe's treasure in order.</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Ecology:</b> Athasian aarakocra are high on the food chain and have no natural enemies other than <a href=\"/appendix/drakatha\">drakes</a>. Unless evil, aarakocra leave their own territory only to hunt the silt drake and return as soon as possible when the hunt is over. (Evil aarakocra attack others, as noted above.) Aarakocra eggs and hatchlings are sought after by wealthy land owners who wish to use the creatures as scouts and sentries. An egg can bring as much as 10 cp in Tyr's marketplace. Tribes that have had eggs or hatchlings stolen have long memories and sometimes take revenge against the thief at a later date. Captive aarakocra join any tribe they come in contact with.</p><p>Athasian aarakocra have a natural life span of 21-30 years.</p><br clear=\"all\" style=\"clear:both; height:0;\">\r\n","images":["<img src=\"grf/ds.gif\" width=\"150\" height=\"75\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Dark Sun\" title=\"Dark Sun\" align=\"right\">","<img src=\"img/aarakath.gif\" alt=\"Aarakocra (Athas)\" title=\"Aarakocra (Athas)\" border=\"0\" width=\"300\" height=\"360\" style=\"text-align:right;\" align=\"right\">","<img src=\"grf/add2_01.gif\" width=\"200\" height=\"56\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Advanced Dungeons & Dragons 2nd Edition\">"],"setting":"Dark Sun","statblock":{"Aarakocra (Athas)":{"Activity Cycle":"Day","Alignment":"Any","Armor Class":"7","Climate/Terrain":"Deep desert","Damage/Attack":"1d3/1d3 or by weapon","Diet":"Carnivore","Frequency":"Rare","Hit Dice":"2+2","Intelligence":"Average (8-10)","Magic Resistance":"Nil","Morale":"Steady (11)","Movement":"6, Fl 36 (C)","No. Appearing":"1d10","No. of Attacks":"2","Organization":"Tribal","Size":"M (20'+ wingspan)","Special Attacks":"Nil","Special Defenses":"Nil","THAC0":"17","Treasure":"Varies","XP Value":"65"}},"title":"Aarakocra (Athas)"},"sources":["2433"],"statblock_names":[],"title":"Aarakocra (Athas)","prev_key":"zygraat","next_key":"aarakocr","monster_path":"/appendix/aarakath"}}},"pageContext":{"monster_key":"lichinhe","monster_data":{"TSR":["2524"],"fullBody":"  <table cellspacing=\"0\" cellpadding=\"0\"><tr><th>Climate/Terrain:</th><td>Any</td></tr><tr><th>Frequency:</th><td>Very rare</td></tr><tr><th>Organization:</th><td>Solitary</td></tr><tr><th>Activity Cycle:</th><td>Night</td></tr><tr><th>Diet:</th><td>Nil</td></tr><tr><th>Intelligence:</th><td>Supra-Genius (19-20)</td></tr><tr><th>Treasure:</th><td>A</td></tr><tr><th>Alignment:</th><td>Any evil</td></tr><tr><th>No. Appearing:</th><td>1</td></tr><tr><th>Armor Class:</th><td>0</td></tr><tr><th>Movement:</th><td>6</td></tr><tr><th>Hit Dice:</th><td>15</td></tr><tr><th>THAC0:</th><td>5</td></tr><tr><th>No. of Attacks:</th><td>1</td></tr><tr><th>Damage/Attack:</th><td>1d10</td></tr><tr><th>Special Attacks:</th><td>Touch, Legacies</td></tr><tr><th>Special Defenses:</th><td>Spell and Legacy immunities, hit only by magical weapons</td></tr><tr><th>Magic Resistance:</th><td>Nil</td></tr><tr><th>Size:</th><td>M (4-7' tall)</td></tr><tr><th>Morale:</th><td>Fanatic (17-18)</td></tr><tr><th>XP Value:</th><td>19,000</td></tr></table><p class=\"f\">These vile undead creatures are the remnants of high-level Inheritors who sought to increase their power. Through arcane, alchemical processes, they transform from living beings into powerful undead creatures. Fortunately, Inheritor <a href=\"/appendix/lich\">liches</a> are extremely rare; only two are known to exist - one in the Savage Baronies (the Doomrider) and one in Renardy.</p><p>The appearance of an Inheritor lich varies widely. The basic visage is that of a skeletal humanoid, but individuals from a number of nonhuman races could also choose this evil path. Each creature then adopts a unique form, warped by the detrimental effects of its Legacies. Thus, an Inheritor lich with Armor, Sight, Burn, Projectile, Growth, and Weapon Hand could have scales; bony eyestalks; red glowing eye sockets; skin that is hot to the touch; flames issuing from its mouth; a hollow, open-ended horn in the center of its forehead; arms twice as long as normal; and one hand elongated into the shape of a bony sword.</p><p>An Inheritor lich is usually dressed in clothing reminiscent of its former life - armor for warriors or robes for wizards. The materials are generally of high quality, though roughly used. As the most ancient Inheritor lich is no more than a decade old, its possessions show little sign of decay but might be frayed from travel or combat.</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Combat:</b> Unlike other liches, an Inheritor lich has no qualms about entering battle. Also, it is likely to have servants and allies - some undead, some monstrous, and perhaps even a few normal humans or humanoids. Inheritor liches lack the magical aura that forces low-level creatures to flee in terror; still, their ghastly appearance causes many intelligent, low-level beings to flee anyway.</p><p>An Inheritor lich prefers to attack with its Legacies when possible. Further, an Inheritor lich is immune to the offensive effects of any Legacies that it possesses. For example, an Inheritor lich with the Burn Legacy cannot take damage from that Legacy when used by another creature.</p><p>The Inheritor lich also retains character class abilities from its former life. A lich that was once a priest, wizard, or bard can cast spells; a former thief can move silently, hide in shadows, and backstab. The Inheritor lich possesses these abilities as a 15th-level character of that class. Finally, the Inheritor lich might even carry arms and equipment from its former life. Wearing armor does not improve a lich's Armor Class, but the lich does receive any magical bonuses the armor might have. Also, Inheritor liches are not vulnerable to smokepowder in the same way that living Inheritors are, so they may carry wheellock pistols.</p><p>In addition to Legacies and class abilities, an Inheritor lich also has a lethal touch. If an Inheritor lich touches an opponent, that touch inflicts 1d10 points of damage. In addition, the victim must make a successful saving throw vs. death magic or suffer the effects of one day in the Time of Loss and Change. It does not matter if <i>cinnabryl</i> is actually being worn, if the target has ever worn it, or even if he is required to. A target who fails a saving throw loses 1 point from the appropriate ability score (or scores) and changes according to the detrimental effects of his Legacy or Legacies (see &ldquo;The Curse and the Legacies&rdquo; chapter of <i>The Savage Coast Campaign Book</i> for descriptions). If the target does not have a Legacy, determine one randomly. A character with multiple Legacies suffers the Time of Loss and Change for all Legacies simultaneously, losing several points and undergoing major physical changes. For this reason, Inheritor liches try to first target Inheritors with this touch. This attack does not actually deplete a target's <i>cinnabryl</i>; it bypasses the metal completely.</p><p>This touch automatically kills any individual who has one or more attribute scores (with the exception of Charisma) reduced to 0 or less. The next night, however, that victim will rise as a cursed one. The lair of an Inheritor lich might hold several <a href=\"/appendix/cursdone\">cursed ones</a>, remnants of former victims. As an Inheritor lich has no need for cinnabryl and cannot be harmed by a cursed one, it may feed them <i>cinnabryl</i> to hasten its transformation into <i>red steel</i>.</p><p>Recovery from Affliction caused by this attack differs from standard recovery in two ways. First, reversal begins immediately after victims receive a <i>remove curse</i> spell, provided that they are still wearing <i>cinnabryl</i>. Second, a system shock roll is not necessary to reverse the transformation. Victims can always recover completely from this forced Affliction.</p><p>An Inheritor lich also has formidable defenses. Besides immunity to Legacies which it possesses, an Inheritor lich is immune to all nonmagical weapons. These creatures also have the standard lich immunities to <i>charm</i>, <i>hold</i>, <i>sleep</i>, <i>enfeeblement</i>, <i>polymorph</i>, <i>insanity</i>, and <i>death</i> spells - as well as cold-based and electrical attacks. Inheritor liches are turned as normal liches.</p><p>While it is difficult to defeat an Inheritor lich in combat, destroying it is harder still. An Inheritor lich protects its life essence in a <i>red steel</i> item hidden in its lair. The item might be a depleted <i>cinnabryl</i> amulet or it could be a <i>red steel</i> weapon or piece of armor. To completely annihilate the Inheritor lich, both its body and that item must be destroyed. Melting it is not sufficient; it must be subjected to a <i>disintegrate</i> spell or similar power. (The Detonate Legacy fragments an item enough that it is considered destroyed.) If the item is merely melted and reforged, the life essence remains in whichever new piece contains the largest percentage of the original item. Inheritor liches take advantage of this by hiding these items very well or, sometimes, by placing their essence in magical <i>red steel</i> weapons that the characters might be loathe to destroy.</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Habitat/Society:</b> : Inheritor liches are solitary creatures. They create lairs in fortified places such as a fortresses, mountains, or caverns. The Inheritor lich, having been an adventurer once, realizes that it will be sought out by other adventurers and will try to keep the location of its lair a secret.</p><p>Still, in its burning desire for power, an Inheritor lich will sometimes spread rumors into the nearby area, hoping to encourage parties of low-level adventurers to come after it so it may rob them of their possessions and life force. Often, the lich will try to meet the adventurers somewhere other than its lair in case it needs to retreat. An Inheritor lich might even create a web of intrigue around itself, using spies and subtle manipulations to exert control over the people and events of a given region.</p><p>The two Inheritor liches known to currently exist also spend a great deal of their time studying the Red Curse. After all, knowledge is another form of power. If it is persuaded to talk, or if its journal can be located, an Inheritor lich can be a great source of knowledge concerning the Red Curse, the Legacies, and the associated magical substances.</p><p>The attitude of an Inheritor lich depends on its former life and subsequent undeath. The creature might hate living Inheritors or might feel nostalgic when meeting a member of its former order.</p><p>Like living Inheritors, these liches often have nicknames - but with a morbid twist. The two existing Inheritor liches are known as Death Flame, who was one of the first Inheritors, and Doomrider, a former Inheritor wizard who now has a <a href=\"/appendix/nightmar\">nightmare</a> for a mount. An Inheritor lich has little respect for life, doing whatever is necessary to accomplish its goals. While it is remotely possible that an Inheritor lich of good alignment could be created, the ambitions that lead a character to such an existence are not usually conducive to any alignment but evil.</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Ecology:</b> While an Inheritor lich has left its natural existence behind, it still has a profound effect on the local ecology by gathering riches, killing others, and causing destruction. While it does not consume or produce in a natural manner, it does create and destroy, doing so to extend the reaches of its power.</p><p>To become an Inheritor lich, an Inheritor must first construct the item that will hold his life essence. This must be done by the prospective lich - never by a second party. Ideally, the <i>red steel</i> used in the creation of the item was worn as <i>cinnabryl</i> by the Inheritor. The Inheritor must also personally create a difficult alchemical preparation. This potion is something like <i>crimson essence</i>, but also contains <i>steel seed</i>, finely ground <i>red steel</i>, herbs, blood, and miscellaneous arcane and costly items. The exact formula is known only to a few, but it might be found in the journals of those who have attempted the process. Like <i>crimson essence</i>, the potion must be bathed in the magic of depleting <i>cinnabryl</i> for several weeks. When ready to become a lich, the Inheritor imbibes the potion; he must then make a successful system shock roll or die. If the roll is successful, the Inheritor becomes an Inheritor lich and immediately enters the Time of Change, transforming according to the Legacies possessed. However, no points are lost from ability scores during this process, and any that were subtracted previously are gained back.</p><br clear=\"all\" style=\"clear:both; height:0;\">\r\n","images":["<img src=\"grf/rs.gif\" width=\"150\" height=\"75\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Red Steel (Mystara)\" title=\"Red Steel (Mystara)\" align=\"right\">","<img src=\"img/lichinhe.gif\" alt=\"Lich, Inheritor\" title=\"Lich, Inheritor\" border=\"0\" width=\"300\" height=\"360\" style=\"text-align:right;\" align=\"right\">","<img src=\"grf/add2_01.gif\" width=\"200\" height=\"56\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Advanced Dungeons & Dragons 2nd Edition\">"],"setting":"Red Steel (Mystara)","statblock":{"Lich, Inheritor":{"Activity Cycle":"Night","Alignment":"Any evil","Armor Class":"0","Climate/Terrain":"Any","Damage/Attack":"1d10","Diet":"Nil","Frequency":"Very rare","Hit Dice":"15","Intelligence":"Supra-Genius (19-20)","Magic Resistance":"Nil","Morale":"Fanatic (17-18)","Movement":"6","No. Appearing":"1","No. of Attacks":"1","Organization":"Solitary","Size":"M (4-7' tall)","Special Attacks":"Touch, Legacies","Special Defenses":"Spell and Legacy immunities, hit only by magical weapons","THAC0":"5","Treasure":"A","XP Value":"19,000"}},"title":"Lich, Inheritor"},"sources":["2524"],"statblock_names":[],"title":"Lich, Inheritor","prev_key":"lichelem","next_key":"lichmast","monster_path":"/appendix/lichinhe"}},"staticQueryHashes":[],"slicesMap":{}}
