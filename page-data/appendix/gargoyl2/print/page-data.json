While the powers listed above are the most common, some aarakocra have different or additional powers.</p><p class=\"f\">A race of intelligent, birdlike creatures living in the deepest deserts of Athas, the rare Athasian <a href=\"/appendix/aarakocr\">aarakocra</a> spends its time soaring on thermals in search of food.</p><p>The aarakocra is 7 to 8 feet tall with a wingspan of 20 feet or more. Because of its large wingspan, an aarakocra can carry as much as 75% of its own body weight and still fly easily. An aarakocra can fly a short distance carrying a burden equaling 125% of its own body weight. The average body weight of a full grown male is 100 pounds and a female is 85 pounds.</p><p>Each wing has a &ldquo;hand&rdquo; at its midpoint, consisting of three fingers and an opposable thumb. The fourth finger forms the rigid leading edge of the wing. In flight the hands cannot be used, but on the ground the aarakocra can use its hands almost as a human would. The aarakocra's body is protected by a thin bony plate on the chest, much like a solid rib cage. Talons on its legs can be used as claws and can be retracted to reveal a second set of hands, also with three fingers and an opposable thumb. Except for the chest plate, the entire skeleton is hollow and extremely fragile.</p><p>From a distance, the Athasian aarakocra resembles a huge <a href=\"/appendix/bird\">vulture</a>. Its black eyes, set in the front of the head, provide excellent vision over a long range. The plumage is generally black with a white collar for adult males and black or brown with a smaller white collar for females. Adolescents are a mixture of brown and black. The beak is large and covers most of the head. Plumage begins at the crown of the head and is darker near the head, except for the collar. Athasian aarakocra speak their own language and the languages of vultures and other large birds. Some speak the common tongue (5% to 10% chance depending on how deep in the wastelands a tribe lives).</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Combat:</b> Aarakocra can fight in the air or on the ground. They prefer aerial combat since their bones are too fragile to withstand a solid blow from a human-sized opponent. In combat against creatures on the ground, they prefer to fly over their victim and drop weighted nets. Some aarakocra use darts to harass ground-based opponents.</p><p>If their opponents can fly, the aarakocra generally forgo the use of the net, although large groups sometimes use nets on flying creatures. Normally, aarakocra attack flying creatures with long spears, diving from above and allowing the momentum to carry the spear through the target. Such an attack doubles the damage if the aarakocra have been able to dive at least 50 feet. Only the very largest aarakocra can carry more than one of these spears, they can attack with both at once with no penalty, causing double damage on each strike. All diving attacks are made at +4 and should be treated as a charge attack. All other penalties and restrictions of charge attacks apply.</p><p>The effect of the aarakocra's nets depends on if the opponent is flying at the time it becomes entangled. Creatures on the ground that are hit by a net are entangled and unable to participate in any combat until they make a successful Strength check to get free of the net. Flying creatures hit by a net can no longer fly and immediately begin falling. If they cannot escape the net or use some magical means to arrest the fall, normal falling damage applies.</p><p>Unless victims are entangled in nets, aarakocra are cautious in ground combat. If the aarakocra outnumber their opponents they advance in a straight line and thrust with their spears. If outnumbered, or the opponents are particularly tough, the aarakocra withdraw. Victims entangled in nets are killed or incapacitated for use as food or ransom.</p><p>Athasian aarakocra are mindful of their physical limitations as well as their comparatively low psionic abilities. They do not normally initiate psionic combat. At the first sign of psionic powers from any of their victims, however, all aarakocra that have some ability will use whatever attack and defense modes they can in an attempt to destroy the threat. Large groups of is or more aarakocra may initiate psionic combat if their leaders feel they can win quickly and avoid physical combat.</p><p>In desperation, an aarakocra can attempt to bite an opponent in combat. Because of the unwieldiness of its beak, the aarakocra has a THAC0 of 18 if attacking with this appendage. Further, the birdman causes only 1d2 points of damage with the beak.</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Habitat/Society:</b> Athasian aarakocra live in tribes with 6-20 (2d8+4) members, depending on the prestige of the leader. The largest tribe ever recorded had 50 members. The tribal hunting territory depends on the size of the tribe, usually about 500 square miles for a tribe of 10 members. There are no rigid boundaries between tribes and border disputes are not uncommon.</p><p>Alignments of tribe members are similar to the alignment of the leader. A tribe that has a leader who is neutral good may have neutral good, chaotic good, lawful good, and true neutral members. A predominantly evil tribe does not recognize boundaries with other tribes and treats other tribes as inferior beings to be eliminated.</p><p>Athasian aarakocra aren't happy in enclosed spaces, but they they take refuge in a cave or building if necessary.</p><p>Nonevil tribes live in rocky aeries in the highest peaks they can find. Evil tribes are normally nomadic and use an aerie made by another tribe if they need to remain in an area for a long time, even if they have to evict the tribe that made the nest.</p><p>Aarakocra aren't friendly toward intruders in their territory, especially caravans. They try to extract a toll from the caravan for passage through the desert. Good-aligned tribes allow unhindered passage of caravans that pay a tribute. If someone refuses to pay the tribute, the aarakocra try to capture scouts or outriders from the party and hold them until an even larger tribute is paid. The payment may be either livestock or shiny objects. Aarakocra are smart enough not to be taken in by glass baubles instead of gems, although they cannot tell the difference between the more common gems and the rare ones.</p><p>Evil tribes ask for tribute and often attack a caravan whether it pays or not. Aarakocra always demand shiny objects such as stones. These tribes find humans and demihumans to be quite tasty and prefer them to other food.</p><p>Good-aligned tribes of aarakocra sometimes return a lost traveler to the edge of the desert after first removing any valuables the traveler may be carrying. On very rare occasions a tribe might return a lost group of travelers to the more frequently traveled parts of the desert, again after first taking any valuables as payment.</p><p>The oldest male is the leader of the tribal hunting party and has 4+4 Hit Dice. The oldest female is in charge of the tribal aerie and has 3+3 HD. In tribes that have more than 15 members, the next oldest aarakocra serves as shaman and has 3+3 HD; the shaman completes the triumvirate necessary for proper worship and the summoning of elementals. (Interestingly, no magic-using aarakocra has ever been recorded.) Tribes without a shaman cannot summon <a href=\"/appendix/element1\">air elementals</a>, which is an important part of aarakocra culture.</p><p>The shaman is the leader of the daily sun worship. Aarakocra worship the sun because it provides them with the thermals they need to soar in search of food. The shaman also leads the mystic rituals used to summon an air elemental. Summoning an air elemental is usually done only in preparation for the tribe's most sacred ceremony, the hunt. Small tribes must band together for this ceremony to allow the triumvirate to be formed.</p><p>The ceremony to summon an air elemental must be conducted at dawn and requires the oldest male and female to emit a highpitched keening whistle. The shaman conducts an intricate dance around them, simultaneously chanting an ancient summoning mantra.</p><p>The hunt is the final part of the initiation of adolescent aarakocra to adulthood and often takes the tribe far from their normal teritory. The target is always a <a href=\"/appendix/drakalsi\">silt drake</a>. The hunt is the only time the females leave the relative safety of the nest. Even an evil tribe will not interfere with a tribe on a hunt. An air elemental is often summoned to help find the drake, but never takes part in the actual combat. Although the adult members of the tribe take part in the initial phases of the combat, it is the initiates who deliver the final, killing blows to me drake. Scars from the hunt are considered a mark of pride among all aarakocra.</p><p>The females spend about eight months of the year incubating their eggs. Athasian aarakocra mate for life and a pair normally produces as many as 10 offspring. A female lays one egg a year. Constant incubation is not required because of the high daytime temperatures, so the females can maintain the nest and keep the tribe's treasure in order.</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Ecology:</b> Athasian aarakocra are high on the food chain and have no natural enemies other than <a href=\"/appendix/drakatha\">drakes</a>. Unless evil, aarakocra leave their own territory only to hunt the silt drake and return as soon as possible when the hunt is over. (Evil aarakocra attack others, as noted above.) Aarakocra eggs and hatchlings are sought after by wealthy land owners who wish to use the creatures as scouts and sentries. An egg can bring as much as 10 cp in Tyr's marketplace. Tribes that have had eggs or hatchlings stolen have long memories and sometimes take revenge against the thief at a later date. Captive aarakocra join any tribe they come in contact with.</p><p>Athasian aarakocra have a natural life span of 21-30 years.</p><br clear=\"all\" style=\"clear:both; height:0;\">\r\n","images":["<img src=\"grf/ds.gif\" width=\"150\" height=\"75\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Dark Sun\" title=\"Dark Sun\" align=\"right\">","<img src=\"img/aarakath.gif\" alt=\"Aarakocra (Athas)\" title=\"Aarakocra (Athas)\" border=\"0\" width=\"300\" height=\"360\" style=\"text-align:right;\" align=\"right\">","<img src=\"grf/add2_01.gif\" width=\"200\" height=\"56\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Advanced Dungeons & Dragons 2nd Edition\">"],"setting":"Dark Sun","statblock":{"Aarakocra (Athas)":{"Activity Cycle":"Day","Alignment":"Any","Armor Class":"7","Climate/Terrain":"Deep desert","Damage/Attack":"1d3/1d3 or by weapon","Diet":"Carnivore","Frequency":"Rare","Hit Dice":"2+2","Intelligence":"Average (8-10)","Magic Resistance":"Nil","Morale":"Steady (11)","Movement":"6, Fl 36 (C)","No. Appearing":"1d10","No. of Attacks":"2","Organization":"Tribal","Size":"M (20'+ wingspan)","Special Attacks":"Nil","Special Defenses":"Nil","THAC0":"17","Treasure":"Varies","XP Value":"65"}},"title":"Aarakocra (Athas)"},"sources":["2433"],"statblock_names":[],"title":"Aarakocra (Athas)","prev_key":"zygraat","next_key":"aarakocr","monster_path":"/appendix/aarakath"}}},"pageContext":{"monster_key":"gargoyl2","monster_data":{"TSR":["2166"],"fullBody":"  <table cellspacing=\"0\" cellpadding=\"0\"><tr class=\"bk\"><th> </th><th class=\"cn\">Archer</th><th class=\"cn\">Spouter</th><th class=\"cn\">Stone Lion</th><th class=\"cn\">Grandfather Plaque</th></tr><tr><th>Climate/Terrain:</th><td>Building or ruin</td><td>Building or ruin</td><td>Building or ruin</td><td>Building or ruin</td></tr><tr><th>Frequency:</th><td>Very rare</td><td>Very rare</td><td>Very rare</td><td>Very rare</td></tr><tr><th>Organization:</th><td>Solitary</td><td>Solitary</td><td>Solitary</td><td>Solitary</td></tr><tr><th>Activity Cycle:</th><td>Any</td><td>Any</td><td>Day</td><td>Day</td></tr><tr><th>Diet:</th><td>Nil</td><td>Nil</td><td>Nil</td><td>Nil</td></tr><tr><th>Intelligence:</th><td>Low (5-7)</td><td>Low (5-7)</td><td>Low (5-7)</td><td>Average (8-10)</td></tr><tr><th>Treasure:</th><td>Nil</td><td>Nil</td><td>Nil</td><td>Nil</td></tr><tr><th>Alignment:</th><td>Chaotic evil</td><td>Neutral evil</td><td>Neutral good</td><td>Lawful neutral</td></tr><tr><th>No. Appearing:</th><td>1</td><td>1 (rarely more)</td><td>1</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><th>Armor Class:</th><td>9</td><td>6</td><td>2</td><td>6</td></tr><tr><th>Movement:</th><td>6</td><td>12</td><td>21</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><th>Hit Dice:</th><td>4+5</td><td>5+7</td><td>8+3</td><td>6+2</td></tr><tr><th>THAC0:</th><td>17</td><td>15</td><td>11</td><td>Nil</td></tr><tr><th>No. of Attacks:</th><td>1</td><td>2</td><td>3</td><td>Nil</td></tr><tr><th>Damage/Attack:</th><td>1d10</td><td>1d4+1/1d4+1</td><td>1d8/1d8/1d10</td><td>Nil</td></tr><tr><th>Special Attacks:</th><td>Nil</td><td>Acid</td><td><i>Scare</i></td><td>Magic missile, shout, weakness</td></tr><tr><th>Special Defenses:</th><td>+1 or better magical weapon to hit, camouflage</td><td>+1 or better magical weapon to hit, camouflage</td><td>+1 or better magical weapon to hit, camouflage</td><td>+1 or better magical weapon to hit, camouflage</td></tr><tr><th>Magic Resistance:</th><td>Nil</td><td>Nil</td><td>Nil</td><td>Nil</td></tr><tr><th>Size:</th><td>S (4' tall)</td><td>S (3' tall)</td><td>M (7' long)</td><td>S (1-2' tall)</td></tr><tr><th>Morale:</th><td>Elite (13-14)</td><td>Elite (13-14)</td><td>Champion (15-16)</td><td>Fanatic (17-18)</td></tr><tr><th>XP Value:</th><td>975</td><td>1,400</td><td>3,000</td><td>2,000</td></tr></table><h2><img src=\"/img/spc/gar2arch.gif\" width=\"300\" height=\"360\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Archer\" title=\"Archer\" style=\"float:right;\">Archer</h2><p class=\"f\">The archer <a href=\"/appendix/gargoyl1\">gargoyle</a> is a malicious creation that looks like a cheerful cherub or, more rarely, a ferocious amazon. Its only sizable weapon or means of attack is a stubby bow and quiver of arrows, apparently carved as part of the statne. The archer typically stands in a fountain or on a ledge high up the wall, or serves as a garden ornament, moving to attack only when an intruder enters its territory. It can remain motionless for as long as it desires.</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Combat:</b> The archer can conceal itself against stone so that it is only 20% likely to be spotted under normal conditions. True to its name, the archer gargoyle uses its bow and arrows as its primary weapon. The bow is not a true bow, and the arrows are stone, but they allow the archer to make an arrowlike magical attack that hits with a THACO of 17 and inflicts 1d10 points of damage. The &ldquo;arrow&rdquo; has a range of 120 yards. Even when engaged in melee, the archer uses the bow at point blank range. The archer can be struck only by weapons of +1 or better enchantment.</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Habitat/Society:</b> These evil creatures love to shoot at passersby, even those who pose no threat, and are thus rarely found guarding the domiciles of good-aligned persons. When found in the wild, the archer is on an unending hunt, slaying every living thing it meets. More than one village has been routed by one of these gargoyles, which delights in mayhem and bloodshed. The archer is a loner and avoids contact with all others of its kind.</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Ecology:</b> The archer need not eat, drink, or sleep. Unlike other types of gargoyles, the archer has a profound destructive impact on its surroundings, because of its tendency to kill every creature and person in its territory, leaving the carcasses to rot. Special hunting parties are often immediately organized to eliminate the menace of a roving archer when one moves into the area.</p><h2><img src=\"/img/spc/gar2spou.gif\" width=\"300\" height=\"360\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Spouter\" title=\"Spouter\" style=\"float:left;\">Spouter</h2><p class=\"f\">The spouter gargoyle generally looks like an ugly <a href=\"/appendix/imp\">imp</a>. It is often found perched above a door or serving as a raingutter outlet on a roof. Its mouth always gapes hideously. Its forearms sport two rows of sharp spikes; on its back are two undersized wings, far too small to provide flight. When motionless, it is indistinguishable from normal stonework. However, plant life and structures in the area will often be pitted and scarred, as if by acid.</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Combat:</b> Anyone who enters the spouter's territory without uttering a password or making the appropriate gesture will be attacked, usually from above, by the spouter's acid spittle. The spittle can be used once every four rounds and has a range of just 5 feet (unless the attack is from above - the spouter can hit anyone directly below, no matter how far down). The acid inflicts 2d20 points of damage, with a successful saving throw vs. breath weapon indicating half damage. If the spouter's opponents escape or prove resistant to the acid, the gargoyle can float down using its tiny undersized wings to break its fall. On the ground, the spouter can attack using its armspikes, which cause 1d4+1 points of damage per attack.</p><p>The spouter has a nasty streak and revels in &ldquo;accidently&rdquo; attacking its master or his associates, even if it recognizes them as safe.</p><p>The spouter is immune to all forms of acid, is struck only by weapons of +1 enchantment or better, and can climb walls with a 90% chance of success.</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Habitat/Society:</b> Though matched sets of spouters are occaionally found, usually there will be only one. Very rarely, a group of 1d4+2 spouters will find each other and join for mutual defense of their territorry. There isn't much competition between group members, so they will choose no chieftain or ruler. Sometimes a &ldquo;free&rdquo; spouter, one whose master has been slain, will offer its services to a powerful evil entity, such is its love of mayhem and its guardian instinct.</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Ecology:</b> Spouters need not eat, drink or sleep, and can remain perfectly motionless for any length of time. Thus, they usually have little impact on their surroundings, other than the havoc their acid wreaks on local plants and structures.</p><h2><img src=\"/img/spc/gar3stli.gif\" width=\"300\" height=\"360\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Stone Lion\" title=\"Stone Lion\" style=\"float:right;\">Stone Lion</h2><p class=\"f\">The stone <a href=\"/appendix/catgreat\">lion</a> is a solemn guardian. often found in pairs, and generally serving good-aligned priests and wizards. The lion has an excellent memory for faces and scents and cannot be fooled by disguises. The lion is usually set up near the main door of the house, but is occasionally placed on a ledge overhead - the stone lion can jump down 20 feet without harm.</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Combat:</b> The stone lion is a superior combattant, functioning as if it had Strength and Dexterity scores of 18. It attacks with its crushing bite and deadly claws, but often defeats its opponents with speed and agility rather than physical power.</p><p>The stone lion has one special power. It can roar once every three rounds, and this functions as a <i>scare</i> spell. Like other gargoyles, a stone lion can be hit only by weapons of +1 or better enchantment.</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Habitat/Society:</b> Unlike other types of gargoyles, a stone lion is a kindly creation and seeks to serve as a protector rather than a wreaker of havoc. It occasionally acts as a pett or companion to its owner, and can form genuine friendships with living beings as well as other stone lions. When motionless, the stone lion is indistinguishable from a statue of a lion carved from stone.</p><p>When its creator dies and the stone lion becomes free-willed, it will often seek to continue its guardian duties along more public lines. Most commonly, they become defenders of temples or of public buildings. They patrol these confines at night, sitting motionless during the day unless needed.</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Ecology:</b> The stone lion is a magical guardian that has little or no impact on its environment. It need not eat, drink, or sleep. When not accompanying its master or patrolling the area. the lion is content to sit motionless, defending its territory.</p><h2><img src=\"/img/spc/gar4gfpl.gif\" width=\"300\" height=\"360\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Grandfather Plaque\" title=\"Grandfather Plaque\" style=\"float:left;\">Grandfather Plaque</h2><p class=\"f\">The grandfather plaque is an immobile guardian that serves to secure a particular door. The plaque resembles a bas relief of a male human face with strong, dignified features. The gargoyle is placed on the stone lintel of a door, and can secure them with a <i>wizard lock</i> (as if cast by a 6th-level wizard), and can open and close them at will.</p><p>The plaque has enough intelligence to screen guests, and it is gifted with telepathy so that it can converse with its master (and only its master - the grandfather plaque can communicate telepathically with only one person, designated at the time of its creation). It can speak to others normally.</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Combat:</b> If attacked, the plaque can defend itself with three magical powers. First, each eye can discharge one <i>magic missile</i> per round. Second, the grandfather plaque can <i>shout</i>, as the 4th-level wizard spell, once per turn. Third, anyone who touches either the plaque or the guarded door without permission must make a saving throw vs. spell or be weakened as if by a <i>ray of enfeeblement</i>, the 2nd-level wizard spell.</p><p>Grandfather plaques can be hit only by weapons of +1 or better enchantment.</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Habitat/Society:</b> The grandfather plaque is totally devoted to guarding its door, and loyally serves whoever lives within. Its focus is usually narrow; unless a response is needed, a grandfather plaque seldom initiates any action. When found on an abandoned building, the plaque will try to get people to either remove it from the building or rebuild the ruin - its existence is meaningless without people to guard.</p><p>If there is more than one grandfather plaque on a building, they guard separate doors, they are never found together.</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Ecology:</b> The grandfather plaque need not eat, sleep, or drink. It has no impact on its surroundings, except when it slays an intruder and the bones and treasure become scattered about. An unattached plaque will freely give adventurers any treasure it has accumulated, as long as they promise to restore the gargoyle to its true purpose.</p><br clear=\"all\" style=\"clear:both; height:0;\">\r\n","images":["<img src=\"grf/xx.gif\" width=\"150\" height=\"75\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Advanced Dungeons & Dragons 2nd Edition\" title=\"Advanced Dungeons & Dragons 2nd Edition\" align=\"right\">","<img src=\"/img/spc/gar2arch.gif\" width=\"300\" height=\"360\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Archer\" title=\"Archer\" style=\"float:right;\">","<img src=\"/img/spc/gar2spou.gif\" width=\"300\" height=\"360\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Spouter\" title=\"Spouter\" style=\"float:left;\">","<img src=\"/img/spc/gar3stli.gif\" width=\"300\" height=\"360\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Stone Lion\" title=\"Stone Lion\" style=\"float:right;\">","<img src=\"/img/spc/gar4gfpl.gif\" width=\"300\" height=\"360\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Grandfather Plaque\" title=\"Grandfather Plaque\" style=\"float:left;\">","<img src=\"grf/tsr_sm.png\" width=\"56\" height=\"59\" border=\"0\" alt=\"TSR\">"],"setting":"Advanced Dungeons & Dragons 2nd Edition","statblock":{"Archer":{"Activity Cycle":"Any","Alignment":"Chaotic evil","Armor Class":"9","Climate/Terrain":"Building or ruin","Damage/Attack":"1d10","Diet":"Nil","Frequency":"Very rare","Hit Dice":"4+5","Intelligence":"Low (5-7)","Magic Resistance":"Nil","Morale":"Elite (13-14)","Movement":"6","No. Appearing":"1","No. of Attacks":"1","Organization":"Solitary","Size":"S (4' tall)","Special Attacks":"Nil","Special Defenses":"+1 or better magical weapon to hit, camouflage","THAC0":"17","Treasure":"Nil","XP Value":"975"},"Grandfather Plaque":{"Activity Cycle":"Day","Alignment":"Lawful neutral","Armor Class":"6","Climate/Terrain":"Building or ruin","Damage/Attack":"Nil","Diet":"Nil","Frequency":"Very rare","Hit Dice":"6+2","Intelligence":"Average (8-10)","Magic Resistance":"Nil","Morale":"Fanatic (17-18)","Movement":"0","No. Appearing":"1","No. of Attacks":"Nil","Organization":"Solitary","Size":"S (1-2' tall)","Special Attacks":"Magic missile, shout, weakness","Special Defenses":"+1 or better magical weapon to hit, camouflage","THAC0":"Nil","Treasure":"Nil","XP Value":"2,000"},"Spouter":{"Activity Cycle":"Any","Alignment":"Neutral evil","Armor Class":"6","Climate/Terrain":"Building or ruin","Damage/Attack":"1d4+1/1d4+1","Diet":"Nil","Frequency":"Very rare","Hit Dice":"5+7","Intelligence":"Low (5-7)","Magic Resistance":"Nil","Morale":"Elite (13-14)","Movement":"12","No. Appearing":"1 (rarely more)","No. of Attacks":"2","Organization":"Solitary","Size":"S (3' tall)","Special Attacks":"Acid","Special Defenses":"+1 or better magical weapon to hit, camouflage","THAC0":"15","Treasure":"Nil","XP Value":"1,400"},"Stone Lion":{"Activity Cycle":"Day","Alignment":"Neutral good","Armor Class":"2","Climate/Terrain":"Building or ruin","Damage/Attack":"1d8/1d8/1d10","Diet":"Nil","Frequency":"Very rare","Hit Dice":"8+3","Intelligence":"Low (5-7)","Magic Resistance":"Nil","Morale":"Champion (15-16)","Movement":"21","No. Appearing":"1","No. of Attacks":"3","Organization":"Solitary","Size":"M (7' long)","Special Attacks":"<i>Scare</i>","Special Defenses":"+1 or better magical weapon to hit, camouflage","THAC0":"11","Treasure":"Nil","XP Value":"3,000"}},"title":"Gargoyle II"},"sources":["2166"],"statblock_names":[],"title":"Gargoyle II","prev_key":"gargoyl1","next_key":"garigal","monster_path":"/appendix/gargoyl2"}},"staticQueryHashes":[],"slicesMap":{}}
