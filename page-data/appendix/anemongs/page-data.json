While the powers listed above are the most common, some aarakocra have different or additional powers.</p><p class=\"f\">A race of intelligent, birdlike creatures living in the deepest deserts of Athas, the rare Athasian <a href=\"/appendix/aarakocr\">aarakocra</a> spends its time soaring on thermals in search of food.</p><p>The aarakocra is 7 to 8 feet tall with a wingspan of 20 feet or more. Because of its large wingspan, an aarakocra can carry as much as 75% of its own body weight and still fly easily. An aarakocra can fly a short distance carrying a burden equaling 125% of its own body weight. The average body weight of a full grown male is 100 pounds and a female is 85 pounds.</p><p>Each wing has a &ldquo;hand&rdquo; at its midpoint, consisting of three fingers and an opposable thumb. The fourth finger forms the rigid leading edge of the wing. In flight the hands cannot be used, but on the ground the aarakocra can use its hands almost as a human would. The aarakocra's body is protected by a thin bony plate on the chest, much like a solid rib cage. Talons on its legs can be used as claws and can be retracted to reveal a second set of hands, also with three fingers and an opposable thumb. Except for the chest plate, the entire skeleton is hollow and extremely fragile.</p><p>From a distance, the Athasian aarakocra resembles a huge <a href=\"/appendix/bird\">vulture</a>. Its black eyes, set in the front of the head, provide excellent vision over a long range. The plumage is generally black with a white collar for adult males and black or brown with a smaller white collar for females. Adolescents are a mixture of brown and black. The beak is large and covers most of the head. Plumage begins at the crown of the head and is darker near the head, except for the collar. Athasian aarakocra speak their own language and the languages of vultures and other large birds. Some speak the common tongue (5% to 10% chance depending on how deep in the wastelands a tribe lives).</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Combat:</b> Aarakocra can fight in the air or on the ground. They prefer aerial combat since their bones are too fragile to withstand a solid blow from a human-sized opponent. In combat against creatures on the ground, they prefer to fly over their victim and drop weighted nets. Some aarakocra use darts to harass ground-based opponents.</p><p>If their opponents can fly, the aarakocra generally forgo the use of the net, although large groups sometimes use nets on flying creatures. Normally, aarakocra attack flying creatures with long spears, diving from above and allowing the momentum to carry the spear through the target. Such an attack doubles the damage if the aarakocra have been able to dive at least 50 feet. Only the very largest aarakocra can carry more than one of these spears, they can attack with both at once with no penalty, causing double damage on each strike. All diving attacks are made at +4 and should be treated as a charge attack. All other penalties and restrictions of charge attacks apply.</p><p>The effect of the aarakocra's nets depends on if the opponent is flying at the time it becomes entangled. Creatures on the ground that are hit by a net are entangled and unable to participate in any combat until they make a successful Strength check to get free of the net. Flying creatures hit by a net can no longer fly and immediately begin falling. If they cannot escape the net or use some magical means to arrest the fall, normal falling damage applies.</p><p>Unless victims are entangled in nets, aarakocra are cautious in ground combat. If the aarakocra outnumber their opponents they advance in a straight line and thrust with their spears. If outnumbered, or the opponents are particularly tough, the aarakocra withdraw. Victims entangled in nets are killed or incapacitated for use as food or ransom.</p><p>Athasian aarakocra are mindful of their physical limitations as well as their comparatively low psionic abilities. They do not normally initiate psionic combat. At the first sign of psionic powers from any of their victims, however, all aarakocra that have some ability will use whatever attack and defense modes they can in an attempt to destroy the threat. Large groups of is or more aarakocra may initiate psionic combat if their leaders feel they can win quickly and avoid physical combat.</p><p>In desperation, an aarakocra can attempt to bite an opponent in combat. Because of the unwieldiness of its beak, the aarakocra has a THAC0 of 18 if attacking with this appendage. Further, the birdman causes only 1d2 points of damage with the beak.</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Habitat/Society:</b> Athasian aarakocra live in tribes with 6-20 (2d8+4) members, depending on the prestige of the leader. The largest tribe ever recorded had 50 members. The tribal hunting territory depends on the size of the tribe, usually about 500 square miles for a tribe of 10 members. There are no rigid boundaries between tribes and border disputes are not uncommon.</p><p>Alignments of tribe members are similar to the alignment of the leader. A tribe that has a leader who is neutral good may have neutral good, chaotic good, lawful good, and true neutral members. A predominantly evil tribe does not recognize boundaries with other tribes and treats other tribes as inferior beings to be eliminated.</p><p>Athasian aarakocra aren't happy in enclosed spaces, but they they take refuge in a cave or building if necessary.</p><p>Nonevil tribes live in rocky aeries in the highest peaks they can find. Evil tribes are normally nomadic and use an aerie made by another tribe if they need to remain in an area for a long time, even if they have to evict the tribe that made the nest.</p><p>Aarakocra aren't friendly toward intruders in their territory, especially caravans. They try to extract a toll from the caravan for passage through the desert. Good-aligned tribes allow unhindered passage of caravans that pay a tribute. If someone refuses to pay the tribute, the aarakocra try to capture scouts or outriders from the party and hold them until an even larger tribute is paid. The payment may be either livestock or shiny objects. Aarakocra are smart enough not to be taken in by glass baubles instead of gems, although they cannot tell the difference between the more common gems and the rare ones.</p><p>Evil tribes ask for tribute and often attack a caravan whether it pays or not. Aarakocra always demand shiny objects such as stones. These tribes find humans and demihumans to be quite tasty and prefer them to other food.</p><p>Good-aligned tribes of aarakocra sometimes return a lost traveler to the edge of the desert after first removing any valuables the traveler may be carrying. On very rare occasions a tribe might return a lost group of travelers to the more frequently traveled parts of the desert, again after first taking any valuables as payment.</p><p>The oldest male is the leader of the tribal hunting party and has 4+4 Hit Dice. The oldest female is in charge of the tribal aerie and has 3+3 HD. In tribes that have more than 15 members, the next oldest aarakocra serves as shaman and has 3+3 HD; the shaman completes the triumvirate necessary for proper worship and the summoning of elementals. (Interestingly, no magic-using aarakocra has ever been recorded.) Tribes without a shaman cannot summon <a href=\"/appendix/element1\">air elementals</a>, which is an important part of aarakocra culture.</p><p>The shaman is the leader of the daily sun worship. Aarakocra worship the sun because it provides them with the thermals they need to soar in search of food. The shaman also leads the mystic rituals used to summon an air elemental. Summoning an air elemental is usually done only in preparation for the tribe's most sacred ceremony, the hunt. Small tribes must band together for this ceremony to allow the triumvirate to be formed.</p><p>The ceremony to summon an air elemental must be conducted at dawn and requires the oldest male and female to emit a highpitched keening whistle. The shaman conducts an intricate dance around them, simultaneously chanting an ancient summoning mantra.</p><p>The hunt is the final part of the initiation of adolescent aarakocra to adulthood and often takes the tribe far from their normal teritory. The target is always a <a href=\"/appendix/drakalsi\">silt drake</a>. The hunt is the only time the females leave the relative safety of the nest. Even an evil tribe will not interfere with a tribe on a hunt. An air elemental is often summoned to help find the drake, but never takes part in the actual combat. Although the adult members of the tribe take part in the initial phases of the combat, it is the initiates who deliver the final, killing blows to me drake. Scars from the hunt are considered a mark of pride among all aarakocra.</p><p>The females spend about eight months of the year incubating their eggs. Athasian aarakocra mate for life and a pair normally produces as many as 10 offspring. A female lays one egg a year. Constant incubation is not required because of the high daytime temperatures, so the females can maintain the nest and keep the tribe's treasure in order.</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Ecology:</b> Athasian aarakocra are high on the food chain and have no natural enemies other than <a href=\"/appendix/drakatha\">drakes</a>. Unless evil, aarakocra leave their own territory only to hunt the silt drake and return as soon as possible when the hunt is over. (Evil aarakocra attack others, as noted above.) Aarakocra eggs and hatchlings are sought after by wealthy land owners who wish to use the creatures as scouts and sentries. An egg can bring as much as 10 cp in Tyr's marketplace. Tribes that have had eggs or hatchlings stolen have long memories and sometimes take revenge against the thief at a later date. Captive aarakocra join any tribe they come in contact with.</p><p>Athasian aarakocra have a natural life span of 21-30 years.</p><br clear=\"all\" style=\"clear:both; height:0;\">\r\n","images":["<img src=\"grf/ds.gif\" width=\"150\" height=\"75\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Dark Sun\" title=\"Dark Sun\" align=\"right\">","<img src=\"img/aarakath.gif\" alt=\"Aarakocra (Athas)\" title=\"Aarakocra (Athas)\" border=\"0\" width=\"300\" height=\"360\" style=\"text-align:right;\" align=\"right\">","<img src=\"grf/add2_01.gif\" width=\"200\" height=\"56\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Advanced Dungeons & Dragons 2nd Edition\">"],"setting":"Dark Sun","statblock":{"Aarakocra (Athas)":{"Activity Cycle":"Day","Alignment":"Any","Armor Class":"7","Climate/Terrain":"Deep desert","Damage/Attack":"1d3/1d3 or by weapon","Diet":"Carnivore","Frequency":"Rare","Hit Dice":"2+2","Intelligence":"Average (8-10)","Magic Resistance":"Nil","Morale":"Steady (11)","Movement":"6, Fl 36 (C)","No. Appearing":"1d10","No. of Attacks":"2","Organization":"Tribal","Size":"M (20'+ wingspan)","Special Attacks":"Nil","Special Defenses":"Nil","THAC0":"17","Treasure":"Varies","XP Value":"65"}},"title":"Aarakocra (Athas)"},"sources":["2433"],"statblock_names":[],"title":"Aarakocra (Athas)","prev_key":"zygraat","next_key":"aarakocr","monster_path":"/appendix/aarakath"}}},"pageContext":{"monster_key":"anemongs","monster_data":{"TSR":["2105","2173"],"fullBody":"  <table cellspacing=\"0\" cellpadding=\"0\"><tr class=\"bk\"><th> </th><th class=\"cn\">Lance Variety</th><th class=\"cn\">Dragon Variety</th></tr><tr><th>Climate/Terrain:</th><td>Tropical, subtropical,<br>and temperate/Salt water</td><td>Ocean depths, tropical coasts</td></tr><tr><th>Frequency:</th><td>Very rare</td><td>Rare</td></tr><tr><th>Organization:</th><td>School</td><td>Solitary</td></tr><tr><th>Activity Cycle:</th><td>Any</td><td>Any</td></tr><tr><th>Diet:</th><td>Carnivore</td><td>Carnivore</td></tr><tr><th>Intelligence:</th><td>Animal (1)</td><td>Non- (0)</td></tr><tr><th>Treasure:</th><td>See below</td><td>Nil</td></tr><tr><th>Alignment:</th><td>Neutral</td><td>Neutral</td></tr><tr><th>No. Appearing:</th><td>3-18</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><th>Armor Class:</th><td>2</td><td>6 (body)/8 (tentacle)</td></tr><tr><th>Movement:</th><td>2�</td><td>Sw 1</td></tr><tr><th>Hit Dice:</th><td>16</td><td>7</td></tr><tr><th>THAC0:</th><td>5</td><td>13</td></tr><tr><th>No. of Attacks:</th><td>See below</td><td>10 tentacles per creature</td></tr><tr><th>Damage/Attack:</th><td>See below</td><td>1d3</td></tr><tr><th>Special Attacks:</th><td>See below</td><td>Paralysis, swallow whole</td></tr><tr><th>Special Defenses:</th><td>See below</td><td>Nil</td></tr><tr><th>Magic Resistance:</th><td>Nil</td><td>Nil</td></tr><tr><th>Size:</th><td>L (10' diameter trunk)</td><td>L (8' diameter)</td></tr><tr><th>Morale:</th><td>Steady (11)</td><td>Fearless (19-20)</td></tr><tr><th>XP Value:</th><td>12,000</td><td>1,000</td></tr></table><h2>Lance Variety</h2><p class=\"f\">The anemone (lance variety) is a mobile, plant-like creature A voracious carnivore, it is a threat to all denizens of the sea.</p><p>The anemone has a thick, cylindrical trunk that is ten feet in diameter and about eight feet tall. The trunk is usually bright purple, but can also be blue red, pink, or any combination of these colors. The bottom of the trunk is covered with small suckers, while the top contains a toothless mouth surrounded by ten translucent tentacles, each 10-15 feet in length.</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Combat:</b> The anemone attacks with whip-like lashes of its tentacles. It makes 1d3 attacks per round, each attack consists of 1dl0 tentacle strikes. A victim struck by a tentacle suffers 1d4 points of damage and also must roll a saving throw vs. paralysis. A victim succeeding on the saving roll is immune to all paralyzing and poison effects of that particular anemone. If the saving throw is unsuccessful, the victim suffers an additional 1d6 points of poison damage and becomes paralyzed for the next 3d6 rounds. During this time, the victim is unable to attack or take any other actions. Should the effects of the paralysis wear off, the anemone will attack him again; if it hits the victim can again attempt a saving throw to avoid the poison and the paralysis.</p><p>The anemone uses its tentacles to drag a paralyzed victim to its mouth, a process that takes one round to complete. it requires at least two tentacles to drag a victim; the anemone can use any free tentacles to continue attacks on other opponents. The mouth leads directly to the anemone's trunk cavity. When a victim is inside the cavity, the mouth seals shut. Tiny valves at the base of the trunk expel all of the water within the cavitv (this takes eight rounds). When the cavity is empty, it begins to refill with acidic juices secreted from glands in the base. The cavity fills with acidic juices at the rate of one foot per turn until the entire cavity is filled. Beginning on the first round of secretion, victims trapped in the cavity suffer 1d4 points of damage (no saving throw). Digestion is completed when the victim is reduced to -12 or fewer hit points, after which <i>resurrection</i> is impossible.</p><p>Because of the confined space, victims trapped in the cavity can use only short, sharp weapons to hack themselves free. Maximum normal damage is 1 point per round plus magical and Strength bonuses. Rescue must usually come from outside. If the anemone suffers a loss of 50% of its hit points, and all of the damage is directed at its trunk the victim can be freed. Thrusting and stabbing weapons have a 20% chance of striking the victim trapped in the trunk. If a trapped character is freed, charactcrs on the outside have a chance of suffering damage from the acidic juice, assuming they are within ten feet of the anemone. The percentage chance of receiving damage is equal to 5% for each foot of juice in the anemone when the victim inside is freed. Characters affected by the juice suffer 1d4 points of damage. (For instance, if the cavity was filled with four feet of acidic juice when the victim inside was freed, all characters within ten feet of the anemone have a 20% chance of suffering 1d4 points of damage from the juice.)</p><p>Each tentacle can suffer only 5 points of damage before it is severed, assuming that the attacker is directing his attacks to the same area in order to chop it off. An anemone regenerates at the rate of 1 point per turn, and it always repairs its tentacles first. If the anemone suffers 30 or more points of damage in a single round, it withdraws all of its tentacles inside its body for 1d10 rounds and spews acidic juices in a ten-foot radius. Those within ten feet of the anemone when it spews juice have a 90% chance of suffering 1d4 points of damage; this check must be made for each round the character is exposed to the acid. When the anemone releases its tentacles, it stops spewing (for instance, if the anemone withdraws its tentacles for six rounds, it also spews juice for six rounds).</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Habitat/Society:</b> Anemones wander the ocean floor. They move slowly and with great effort, generally preferring to remain stationary for long periods by attaching to a rock or other solid surface. They usually travel in schools of three or more.</p><p>Anemones are asexual, reproducing via buds which break off and grow into new anemones. Indigestible treasure items can sometimes be found beneath their trunks.</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Ecology:</b> Anemones eat all species of marine life. Anemones relish humanoids, especially elves and small humans. Although most sea creatures give anemones wide berth, manta rays and small sucker fish are sometimes seen swimming among a school of anemones, as these creatures are immune to the effects of their tentacles.</p><h2>Dragon Variety</h2><p class=\"f\">The giant sea anamone (dragon variety) is a larger and far more dangerous version of its smaller relative (the normal sea anemone, not the lance variety described above). Although it lives at a variety or ocean depths, it is encountered singly below 50 feet. The anemone has a stout central body about 8 feet in diameter, crowned with a gaping maw about 6 feet in diameter. Surrounding the maw are many stinging tentacles, about 100 in most species. These floating, waving tentacles can snare prey within 30 feet of the body. Giant sea anemones are often very colorful, being a riot of red, green, pink, blue, or a combination of colors.</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Combat:</b> The gentle drifting motion of the sea anemone's tentacles belies how swiftly they can react to seize and draw in any prey that so much as brushes against them. A successful hit by a tentacle pierces the victim with hundreds of small, barbed, hook-like needles that collectively inflict 1d3 points of damage on the initial strike (only). The anemone will attempt to attach at least three tentacles to the prey, making up to three attacks per round against creatures in reach of its tentacles.</p><p>The round after the first tentacle hits, the prey is injected with a paralytic poison. A saving throw vs. poison negates the paralytic effect for one round, check each round until free or a saving throw is failed. Once affected, each round the prey loses 1 point of movement, Dexterity, and Strength. When at least one of these is reduced to 0, the prey is paralyzed for 2d4 turns. (Creatures unrated for Strength and Dexterity use the movement rating.) Having more than one tentacle attached does not accelerate the paralysis, but the poison advances as long as a single tentacle is attached. A <i>neutralize poison</i> spell can negate all poison in the prey's system, but does not prevent new poison from being administered.</p><p>A trapped prey can attempt to escape at round. Each tentacle's hold can be broken the beginning of each round. Each tentacle's hold can be broken by a successful saving throw vs. petrification; check for each tentacle. A prey that escapes all tentacles is free to act normally, subject to the effects of the paralytic poison already in its system. A tentacle can be severed by 6 points of slashing damage. Severed tentacles do not count against the giant anemone's hit points.</p><p>Once the prey has been seized by three tentacles, the anemone attempts to swallow it whole. This requires a successful attack roll. The anemone's internal organs grind up the prey at a rate equal to the prey's base armor class (physical armor) per round; a victim in plate armor +3 would take no damage. Inedible prey, or an object too large for the anemone's mouth (6-feet diameter) will be held until paralyzed, then released to drift on the currents or fall to the sea bottom, where it will be picked apart by other scavengers. If the maw is full, other prey is held for later.</p><p>The anemone is slain when its central body is reduced to 0 hit points or less. All tentacles regrow at the rate of one foot per day.</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Habitat/Society:</b> Though they may look like plants, giant sea anemones are animals, if very basic ones. While giant sea anemones are often encountered as stationary hazards, but they can, in fact, slowly move to new locations that promise a better food supply.</p><p>Most species of giant sea anemone, when seriously threatened, can pull their tentacles all the way back into their central bodies. An anemone might be easily mistaken for a large rock when its tentacles are withdrawn.</p><p>The giant sea anemone produces by budding. The young anemone grows out of the base of the parent. When sufficiently grown, it breaks off and moves to its own feeding ground.</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Ecology:</b> Some fish are immune to the poison of the giant sea anemone. Two types are common. The first type consists of 1- to 2-foot long, brightly colored fish that escapes predators by hiding among the tentacles; the anemone does not attack them at all. Unwary predators who venture too close to the anemone are trapped, however, and the small fish feed on the scraps left by the anemone. The second type of fish is a predator, such as a barracuda, that attacks the tentacles and feeds on them. These fish are either immune to the anemone's poison or have thicker hides than most other fish to defeat the barbed needles of the tentacles. They attack the tentacles in swift darting forays.</p><p>Giant sea anemones are sometimes kept as guard creatures by underwater races, who feed them enough to keep them from leaving, while leaving them hungry enough to attack intruders.</p><br clear=\"all\" style=\"clear:both; height:0;\">\r\n","images":["<img src=\"grf/dl.gif\" width=\"150\" height=\"75\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Dragonlance\" title=\"Dragonlance\" align=\"right\">","<img src=\"img/anemongs.gif\" alt=\"Anemone, Giant Sea\" title=\"Anemone, Giant Sea\" border=\"0\" width=\"300\" height=\"360\" style=\"text-align:right;\" align=\"right\">","<img src=\"grf/add2_01.gif\" width=\"200\" height=\"56\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Advanced Dungeons & Dragons 2nd Edition\">"],"setting":"Dragonlance","statblock":{"Dragon Variety":{"Activity Cycle":"Any","Alignment":"Neutral","Armor Class":"6 (body)/8 (tentacle)","Climate/Terrain":"Ocean depths, tropical coasts","Damage/Attack":"1d3","Diet":"Carnivore","Frequency":"Rare","Hit Dice":"7","Intelligence":"Non- (0)","Magic Resistance":"Nil","Morale":"Fearless (19-20)","Movement":"Sw 1","No. Appearing":"1","No. of Attacks":"10 tentacles per creature","Organization":"Solitary","Size":"L (8' diameter)","Special Attacks":"Paralysis, swallow whole","Special Defenses":"Nil","THAC0":"13","Treasure":"Nil","XP Value":"1,000"},"Lance Variety":{"Activity Cycle":"Any","Alignment":"Neutral","Armor Class":"2","Climate/Terrain":"Tropical, subtropical,<br>and temperate/Salt water","Damage/Attack":"See below","Diet":"Carnivore","Frequency":"Very rare","Hit Dice":"16","Intelligence":"Animal (1)","Magic Resistance":"Nil","Morale":"Steady (11)","Movement":"2�","No. Appearing":"3-18","No. of Attacks":"See below","Organization":"School","Size":"L (10' diameter trunk)","Special Attacks":"See below","Special Defenses":"See below","THAC0":"5","Treasure":"See below","XP Value":"12,000"}},"title":"Anemone, Giant Sea"},"sources":["2105","2173"],"statblock_names":[],"title":"Anemone, Giant Sea","prev_key":"andeloid","next_key":"anglfish","monster_path":"/appendix/anemongs"}},"staticQueryHashes":[],"slicesMap":{}}
