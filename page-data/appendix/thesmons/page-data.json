While the powers listed above are the most common, some aarakocra have different or additional powers.</p><p class=\"f\">A race of intelligent, birdlike creatures living in the deepest deserts of Athas, the rare Athasian <a href=\"/appendix/aarakocr\">aarakocra</a> spends its time soaring on thermals in search of food.</p><p>The aarakocra is 7 to 8 feet tall with a wingspan of 20 feet or more. Because of its large wingspan, an aarakocra can carry as much as 75% of its own body weight and still fly easily. An aarakocra can fly a short distance carrying a burden equaling 125% of its own body weight. The average body weight of a full grown male is 100 pounds and a female is 85 pounds.</p><p>Each wing has a &ldquo;hand&rdquo; at its midpoint, consisting of three fingers and an opposable thumb. The fourth finger forms the rigid leading edge of the wing. In flight the hands cannot be used, but on the ground the aarakocra can use its hands almost as a human would. The aarakocra's body is protected by a thin bony plate on the chest, much like a solid rib cage. Talons on its legs can be used as claws and can be retracted to reveal a second set of hands, also with three fingers and an opposable thumb. Except for the chest plate, the entire skeleton is hollow and extremely fragile.</p><p>From a distance, the Athasian aarakocra resembles a huge <a href=\"/appendix/bird\">vulture</a>. Its black eyes, set in the front of the head, provide excellent vision over a long range. The plumage is generally black with a white collar for adult males and black or brown with a smaller white collar for females. Adolescents are a mixture of brown and black. The beak is large and covers most of the head. Plumage begins at the crown of the head and is darker near the head, except for the collar. Athasian aarakocra speak their own language and the languages of vultures and other large birds. Some speak the common tongue (5% to 10% chance depending on how deep in the wastelands a tribe lives).</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Combat:</b> Aarakocra can fight in the air or on the ground. They prefer aerial combat since their bones are too fragile to withstand a solid blow from a human-sized opponent. In combat against creatures on the ground, they prefer to fly over their victim and drop weighted nets. Some aarakocra use darts to harass ground-based opponents.</p><p>If their opponents can fly, the aarakocra generally forgo the use of the net, although large groups sometimes use nets on flying creatures. Normally, aarakocra attack flying creatures with long spears, diving from above and allowing the momentum to carry the spear through the target. Such an attack doubles the damage if the aarakocra have been able to dive at least 50 feet. Only the very largest aarakocra can carry more than one of these spears, they can attack with both at once with no penalty, causing double damage on each strike. All diving attacks are made at +4 and should be treated as a charge attack. All other penalties and restrictions of charge attacks apply.</p><p>The effect of the aarakocra's nets depends on if the opponent is flying at the time it becomes entangled. Creatures on the ground that are hit by a net are entangled and unable to participate in any combat until they make a successful Strength check to get free of the net. Flying creatures hit by a net can no longer fly and immediately begin falling. If they cannot escape the net or use some magical means to arrest the fall, normal falling damage applies.</p><p>Unless victims are entangled in nets, aarakocra are cautious in ground combat. If the aarakocra outnumber their opponents they advance in a straight line and thrust with their spears. If outnumbered, or the opponents are particularly tough, the aarakocra withdraw. Victims entangled in nets are killed or incapacitated for use as food or ransom.</p><p>Athasian aarakocra are mindful of their physical limitations as well as their comparatively low psionic abilities. They do not normally initiate psionic combat. At the first sign of psionic powers from any of their victims, however, all aarakocra that have some ability will use whatever attack and defense modes they can in an attempt to destroy the threat. Large groups of is or more aarakocra may initiate psionic combat if their leaders feel they can win quickly and avoid physical combat.</p><p>In desperation, an aarakocra can attempt to bite an opponent in combat. Because of the unwieldiness of its beak, the aarakocra has a THAC0 of 18 if attacking with this appendage. Further, the birdman causes only 1d2 points of damage with the beak.</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Habitat/Society:</b> Athasian aarakocra live in tribes with 6-20 (2d8+4) members, depending on the prestige of the leader. The largest tribe ever recorded had 50 members. The tribal hunting territory depends on the size of the tribe, usually about 500 square miles for a tribe of 10 members. There are no rigid boundaries between tribes and border disputes are not uncommon.</p><p>Alignments of tribe members are similar to the alignment of the leader. A tribe that has a leader who is neutral good may have neutral good, chaotic good, lawful good, and true neutral members. A predominantly evil tribe does not recognize boundaries with other tribes and treats other tribes as inferior beings to be eliminated.</p><p>Athasian aarakocra aren't happy in enclosed spaces, but they they take refuge in a cave or building if necessary.</p><p>Nonevil tribes live in rocky aeries in the highest peaks they can find. Evil tribes are normally nomadic and use an aerie made by another tribe if they need to remain in an area for a long time, even if they have to evict the tribe that made the nest.</p><p>Aarakocra aren't friendly toward intruders in their territory, especially caravans. They try to extract a toll from the caravan for passage through the desert. Good-aligned tribes allow unhindered passage of caravans that pay a tribute. If someone refuses to pay the tribute, the aarakocra try to capture scouts or outriders from the party and hold them until an even larger tribute is paid. The payment may be either livestock or shiny objects. Aarakocra are smart enough not to be taken in by glass baubles instead of gems, although they cannot tell the difference between the more common gems and the rare ones.</p><p>Evil tribes ask for tribute and often attack a caravan whether it pays or not. Aarakocra always demand shiny objects such as stones. These tribes find humans and demihumans to be quite tasty and prefer them to other food.</p><p>Good-aligned tribes of aarakocra sometimes return a lost traveler to the edge of the desert after first removing any valuables the traveler may be carrying. On very rare occasions a tribe might return a lost group of travelers to the more frequently traveled parts of the desert, again after first taking any valuables as payment.</p><p>The oldest male is the leader of the tribal hunting party and has 4+4 Hit Dice. The oldest female is in charge of the tribal aerie and has 3+3 HD. In tribes that have more than 15 members, the next oldest aarakocra serves as shaman and has 3+3 HD; the shaman completes the triumvirate necessary for proper worship and the summoning of elementals. (Interestingly, no magic-using aarakocra has ever been recorded.) Tribes without a shaman cannot summon <a href=\"/appendix/element1\">air elementals</a>, which is an important part of aarakocra culture.</p><p>The shaman is the leader of the daily sun worship. Aarakocra worship the sun because it provides them with the thermals they need to soar in search of food. The shaman also leads the mystic rituals used to summon an air elemental. Summoning an air elemental is usually done only in preparation for the tribe's most sacred ceremony, the hunt. Small tribes must band together for this ceremony to allow the triumvirate to be formed.</p><p>The ceremony to summon an air elemental must be conducted at dawn and requires the oldest male and female to emit a highpitched keening whistle. The shaman conducts an intricate dance around them, simultaneously chanting an ancient summoning mantra.</p><p>The hunt is the final part of the initiation of adolescent aarakocra to adulthood and often takes the tribe far from their normal teritory. The target is always a <a href=\"/appendix/drakalsi\">silt drake</a>. The hunt is the only time the females leave the relative safety of the nest. Even an evil tribe will not interfere with a tribe on a hunt. An air elemental is often summoned to help find the drake, but never takes part in the actual combat. Although the adult members of the tribe take part in the initial phases of the combat, it is the initiates who deliver the final, killing blows to me drake. Scars from the hunt are considered a mark of pride among all aarakocra.</p><p>The females spend about eight months of the year incubating their eggs. Athasian aarakocra mate for life and a pair normally produces as many as 10 offspring. A female lays one egg a year. Constant incubation is not required because of the high daytime temperatures, so the females can maintain the nest and keep the tribe's treasure in order.</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Ecology:</b> Athasian aarakocra are high on the food chain and have no natural enemies other than <a href=\"/appendix/drakatha\">drakes</a>. Unless evil, aarakocra leave their own territory only to hunt the silt drake and return as soon as possible when the hunt is over. (Evil aarakocra attack others, as noted above.) Aarakocra eggs and hatchlings are sought after by wealthy land owners who wish to use the creatures as scouts and sentries. An egg can bring as much as 10 cp in Tyr's marketplace. Tribes that have had eggs or hatchlings stolen have long memories and sometimes take revenge against the thief at a later date. Captive aarakocra join any tribe they come in contact with.</p><p>Athasian aarakocra have a natural life span of 21-30 years.</p><p></p><br clear=\"all\" style=\"clear:both; height:0;\">\r\n","images":["<img src=\"grf/ds.gif\" width=\"150\" height=\"75\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Dark Sun\" title=\"Dark Sun\" align=\"right\">","<img src=\"img/aarakath.gif\" alt=\"Aarakocra (Athas)\" title=\"Aarakocra (Athas)\" border=\"0\" width=\"300\" height=\"360\" style=\"text-align:right;\" align=\"right\">","<img src=\"grf/add2_01.gif\" width=\"200\" height=\"56\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Advanced Dungeons & Dragons 2nd Edition\">"],"setting":"Dark Sun","statblock":{"Aarakocra (Athas)":{"Activity Cycle":"Day","Alignment":"Any","Armor Class":"7","Climate/Terrain":"Deep desert","Damage/Attack":"1d3/1d3 or by weapon","Diet":"Carnivore","Frequency":"Rare","Hit Dice":"2+2","Intelligence":"Average (8-10)","Magic Resistance":"Nil","Morale":"Steady (11)","Movement":"6, Fl 36 (C)","No. Appearing":"1d10","No. of Attacks":"2","Organization":"Tribal","Size":"M (20'+ wingspan)","Special Attacks":"Nil","Special Defenses":"Nil","THAC0":"17","Treasure":"Varies","XP Value":"65"}},"title":"Aarakocra (Athas)"},"sources":["2433"],"statblock_names":[],"title":"Aarakocra (Athas)","prev_key":"zygraat","next_key":"aarakocr","monster_path":"/appendix/aarakath"}}},"pageContext":{"monster_key":"thesmons","monster_data":{"TSR":["2104","2166"],"fullBody":"  <table cellspacing=\"0\" cellpadding=\"0\"><tr class=\"bk\"><th> </th><th class=\"cn\">Thessalhydra</th><th class=\"cn\">Thessalmera</th><th class=\"cn\">Thessalgorgon</th><th class=\"cn\">Thessaltrice</th></tr><tr><th>Climate/Terrain:</th><td>Damp, dark places</td><td>Damp, dark places</td><td>Damp, dark places</td><td>Damp, dark places</td></tr><tr><th>Frequency:</th><td>Rare</td><td>Very rare</td><td>Very rare</td><td>Very rare</td></tr><tr><th>Organization:</th><td>Solitary</td><td>Solitary</td><td>Solitary</td><td>Solitary</td></tr><tr><th>Activity Cycle:</th><td>Nocturnal</td><td>Nocturnal</td><td>Nocturnal</td><td>Nocturnal</td></tr><tr><th>Diet:</th><td>Carnivore</td><td>Carnivore</td><td>Carnivore</td><td>Carnivore</td></tr><tr><th>Intelligence:</th><td>Low (5-7)</td><td>Low (5-7)</td><td>Low (5-7)</td><td>Low (5-7)</td></tr><tr><th>Treasure:</th><td>Incidental</td><td>Nil (Any)</td><td>Nil (A)</td><td>Nil (D)</td></tr><tr><th>Alignment:</th><td>Neutral</td><td>Neutral evil</td><td>Neutral</td><td>Neutral</td></tr><tr><th>No. Appearing:</th><td>1</td><td>1</td><td>1</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><th>Armor Class:</th><td>0</td><td>5/2/0</td><td>2</td><td>3</td></tr><tr><th>Movement:</th><td>12</td><td>12</td><td>12</td><td>12</td></tr><tr><th>Hit Dice:</th><td>12</td><td>10</td><td>10</td><td>8</td></tr><tr><th>THAC0:</th><td>9</td><td>11</td><td>11</td><td>13</td></tr><tr><th>No. of Attacks:</th><td>10</td><td>9 to 11</td><td>9</td><td>9</td></tr><tr><th>Damage/Attack:</th><td>1d6 (&times;8)/1d12/1d20</td><td>1d6 (&times;6-8)/3d4/1d12/2d4</td><td>1d6 (&times;8)/2d6</td><td>1d6 (&times;8)/1d10</td></tr><tr><th>Special Attacks:</th><td>Poison, acid</td><td>Acid, fire, immobilization</td><td>Poison, petrification</td><td>Poison, petrification</td></tr><tr><th>Special Defenses:</th><td>Immune to acid</td><td>Regenerate, resist fire, immune to acid and petrification</td><td>Immune to acid and petrification</td><td>Nil</td></tr><tr><th>Magic Resistance:</th><td>Nil</td><td>Nil</td><td>Nil</td><td>Nil</td></tr><tr><th>Size:</th><td>H (30' long)</td><td>H (30' long)</td><td>H (30' long)</td><td>H (20' long)</td></tr><tr><th>Morale:</th><td>Steady (11-12)</td><td>Steady (11-12)</td><td>Steady (11-12)</td><td>Steady (11-12)</td></tr><tr><th>XP Value:</th><td>12,000</td><td>10,000</td><td>9,000</td><td>8,000</td></tr></table><p class=\"f\">The thessalmonsters are a family of hybrid monsters resembling <a href=\"/appendix/hydra\">hydras</a>. There are four known types of thessalmonsters.</p><p>The actual derivation of the name &rdquo;thessal&rdquo; is unknown. Legends suggest that the name thessal referred to a person or organization responsible for the creation of these monstrosities, or the land where they were first encountered.</p><p>The original thessalmonster is now extinct. It resembled the thessalhydra except that it lacked the fringe of serpentine heads. The thessalmonster was so genetically unstable that it was able to crossbreed with other monsters, such as hydras, <a href=\"/appendix/gorgon\">gorgons</a>, <a href=\"/appendix/chimera\">chimerae</a>, and even the drastically smaller <a href=\"/appendix/cockatri\">cockatrice</a>.</p><h2>Thessalhydra</h2><p class=\"f\">The thessalhydra resembles an eight-headed hydra. It has a large, reptilian torso and tail measuring 30 feet long (8 feet tall at the shoulder). Eight serpentine heads surround a large, circular month rimmed with jagged teeth. Each serpentine head and neck measures 6 feet long. At the end of the 18-foot-long tail is a pair of sharp pincers.</p><p>Most of the shiny bide is a deep green. The undersides of the necks, torso, and tail are ocher yellow. Patches of reddish yellow hair cover the chest and upper forelegs. The eyes are dark red.</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Combat:</b> The thessalhydra attacks with its serpentine heads. Each head attacks independently and bites for 1d6 points of damage plus an additional 1d6 points if the victim fails a saving throw vs. poison. The main mouth bites for 1d20 points of damage plus an additional 1d20 points if the victim fails a saving throw vs. poison. The tail pincer can grasp an opponent, deliver 1d12 points of damage, and deposit the victim in the mouth in the same round. Items placed in the central mouth must roll saving throws vs. acid and crushing blows each round until destroyed or removed.</p><p>Once per day, the thessalhydra can spit out a gob of acidic saliva from its main mouth. This gob can cover a 12-foot-dimeter circle at a range of 30 yards. Creatures struck by the acid suffer 12d6 points of damage (half if a saving throw vs. poison is successful).</p><p>Thessalhydrae are immune to all acids and acidic poisons.</p><p>A fringe head can suffer 12 points of damage before it is severed. Damage done to heads does not affect the overall hit points of the monster. Severed heads are regenerated in 12 days.</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Habitat/Society:</b> Thessalhydrae prefer dark, damp settings, such as swamps, jungles, and subterranean lairs. They do not collect treasure. Such items as they possess are the remains of former meals that have somehow survived the chewing and acid of the monsters' digestive tracts.</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Ecology:</b> Thessalhydrae are often confused with hydras. They prey upon their less intelligent kin and anything else edible that wanders by They may take advantage of their resemblance to attack would-be hydra slayers.</p><p>Their eggs are worth 7,500 gp and young are worth 12,000 gp. The young can be chained in place to act as guardians for specific locations or set to roaming normally unused areas.</p><h2>Thessalmera</h2><p class=\"f\">The thessalmera is a hybrid of thessalhydra and chimera. It has the scaled, lizardlike body and pincer-clawed tail of the thessalhydra, six to eight snakelike heads, a <a href=\"/appendix/catgreat\">lion's</a> head in the middle of the snake heads, and a <a href=\"/appendix/dragcred\">red-dragon</a>like head above these on the upper back. The lion's head is covered in reddish gold hair. Patches of red-black hair cover the chest and upper forelegs.</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Combat:</b> The snakelike heads cause 1d6 points of damage per bite, plus 1d6 per bit from the monster's acidic venom (half if a saving throw vs. poison is successful). The thessalmera cannot spit acid.</p><p>The lion jaws' bite causes 3d4 points of damage. The pincerlike tail inflicts 1d12 points of damage on a hit and can grasp one man-sized or smaller opponent. Victims are held immobile and can escape with a successful open doors roll (1d20, with a +5 bonus, one attempt per round).</p><p>The dragon head bites for 2d4 points of damage or breathes fire up to six times. The flame extends in a cone 5 feet wide at its mouth, widening to 50 feet at its maximum range of 20 feet. The flame causes 3d8 points of damage (half if saving throw vs. breath weapon succeeds).</p><p>The serpentine heads can be killed with 12 points of damage; harming these does not diminish the monster's overall hit points. The thessalmera is always controlled by the lion head unless this is damaged or destroyed, in which case the dragon head takes over. If that is destroyed, the thessalmera becomes a semi-intelligent, frenzied berserker, fearlessly and recklessly attacking everything within reach. When it is done, it retires to a cave to regrow its missing heads.</p><p>Thessalmera regenerate 2 hit points every 24 hours. They are resistant to fire (+3 bonus to saving throws vs. heat and fire). They are immune to petrification and acid.</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Habitat/Society:</b> These fearsome creatures make their lairs in swamps, jungles, and cavern. They can endure extreme environments with impunity.</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Ecology:</b> The cunning thessalmera is often found close to society, where it can feed on livestock and travelers under the cover of night. It prefers human flesh to other meats.</p><p>Eggs are worth 8,000 gp. Young are worth 12,000 gp. The young can be chained in place to act as guardians for smecific locations or set to roaming normally unused areas.</p><h2>Thessalgorgon</h2><p class=\"f\">The thessalgorgon is a hybrid of a thessalhydra and a gorgon. It has the scaled, lizardlike body of the thessalhydra, eight snakelike heads, and a bull's head in the middle of the snake heads. The entire body is covered in thick, metallic scales that are a coppery green in color. A thatch of green-black hair covers the top of the bull's head, the chest, and upper forelegs.</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Combat:</b> Each head attacks independently and bites for 1d6 points of damage plus an additional 1d6 points if the victim fails a saving throw vs. poison. The main mouth bites for 2d6 points of damage plus an additional 2d6 points if the victim fails a saving throw vs. poison.</p><p>Four times per day, the thessalgorgon can breathe out a cone of petrifying gas measuring 5 feet at the mouth, 60 feet long, and 20 feet wide at the end. Victims who fail their saving throws vs. petrification are immediately turned to stone.</p><p>Thessalgorgons are immune to petrification and all acids.</p><p>A fringe head can suffer 12 points of damage before it is severed. Damage done to heads does not affect the overall hit points of the monster. Severed heads are regenerated in 12 days.</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Habitat/Society:</b> These monsters prefer caves in wilderness regions.</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Ecology:</b> The eggs are worth 7,000 gp and the young are worth 10,000 gp. The young can be chained in place to act as guardians for specific locations or set to roaming normally unused areas.</p><h2>Thessaltrice</h2><p class=\"f\">The thessaltrice is a hybrid of a thessalhydra and a cockatrice. The eight fringe heads of the thessaltrice resemble the head and neck of a cockatrice. The wattle, comb, eyes, and tongue are bright red. The green neck is covered with reddish gold feathers. The reptilian torso and tail are deep green with a yellow underbelly, The torso measures 12 feet long (6 feet at the shoulder), while the tail is 8 feet long. Each cockatricelike head and neck measures 6 feet in length.</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Combat:</b> The thessaltrice attacks with its circle of cockatrice-like heads. Each head can attack independently with a bite that causes 1d6 points of damage plus an additional 1d6 points if the victim fails a saving throw vs. poison. The central mouth inflicts 1d1O points of damage plus 1d1O if the victim fails a saving throw vs. poison. Each head can attack independently. Fringe heads take 8 points of damage before they are severed. Lost heads regenerate in 10 days. Damage done to heads does not injure the body.</p><p>Each head can, once per day, petrify a victim by touch. This petrification effect can extend into the Astral and Ethereal planes.</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Habitat/Society:</b> The thessaltrice prefers warm conditions, such as tropical swamps, jungles, and caverns.</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Ecology:</b> Thessaltrice treasure consists of the possessions of petrified victims.</p><p>The eggs are worth 5,000 gp and the young are worth 10,000 gp. The young can be chained in place to act as guardians for specific locations or set to roaming normally unused areas.</p><p></p><br clear=\"all\" style=\"clear:both; height:0;\">\r\n","images":["<img src=\"grf/fr.gif\" width=\"150\" height=\"75\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Forgotten Realms\" title=\"Forgotten Realms\" align=\"right\">","<img src=\"img/thesmons.gif\" alt=\"Thessalmonster\" title=\"Thessalmonster\" border=\"0\" width=\"300\" height=\"360\" style=\"text-align:right;\" align=\"right\">","<img src=\"grf/add2_01.gif\" width=\"200\" height=\"56\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Advanced Dungeons & Dragons 2nd Edition\">"],"setting":"Forgotten Realms","statblock":{"Thessalgorgon":{"Activity Cycle":"Nocturnal","Alignment":"Neutral","Armor Class":"2","Climate/Terrain":"Damp, dark places","Damage/Attack":"1d6 (&times;8)/2d6","Diet":"Carnivore","Frequency":"Very rare","Hit Dice":"10","Intelligence":"Low (5-7)","Magic Resistance":"Nil","Morale":"Steady (11-12)","Movement":"12","No. Appearing":"1","No. of Attacks":"9","Organization":"Solitary","Size":"H (30' long)","Special Attacks":"Poison, petrification","Special Defenses":"Immune to acid and petrification","THAC0":"11","Treasure":"Nil (A)","XP Value":"9,000"},"Thessalhydra":{"Activity Cycle":"Nocturnal","Alignment":"Neutral","Armor Class":"0","Climate/Terrain":"Damp, dark places","Damage/Attack":"1d6 (&times;8)/1d12/1d20","Diet":"Carnivore","Frequency":"Rare","Hit Dice":"12","Intelligence":"Low (5-7)","Magic Resistance":"Nil","Morale":"Steady (11-12)","Movement":"12","No. Appearing":"1","No. of Attacks":"10","Organization":"Solitary","Size":"H (30' long)","Special Attacks":"Poison, acid","Special Defenses":"Immune to acid","THAC0":"9","Treasure":"Incidental","XP Value":"12,000"},"Thessalmera":{"Activity Cycle":"Nocturnal","Alignment":"Neutral evil","Armor Class":"5/2/0","Climate/Terrain":"Damp, dark places","Damage/Attack":"1d6 (&times;6-8)/3d4/1d12/2d4","Diet":"Carnivore","Frequency":"Very rare","Hit Dice":"10","Intelligence":"Low (5-7)","Magic Resistance":"Nil","Morale":"Steady (11-12)","Movement":"12","No. Appearing":"1","No. of Attacks":"9 to 11","Organization":"Solitary","Size":"H (30' long)","Special Attacks":"Acid, fire, immobilization","Special Defenses":"Regenerate, resist fire, immune to acid and petrification","THAC0":"11","Treasure":"Nil (Any)","XP Value":"10,000"},"Thessaltrice":{"Activity Cycle":"Nocturnal","Alignment":"Neutral","Armor Class":"3","Climate/Terrain":"Damp, dark places","Damage/Attack":"1d6 (&times;8)/1d10","Diet":"Carnivore","Frequency":"Very rare","Hit Dice":"8","Intelligence":"Low (5-7)","Magic Resistance":"Nil","Morale":"Steady (11-12)","Movement":"12","No. Appearing":"1","No. of Attacks":"9","Organization":"Solitary","Size":"H (20' long)","Special Attacks":"Poison, petrification","Special Defenses":"Nil","THAC0":"13","Treasure":"Nil (D)","XP Value":"8,000"}},"title":"Thessalmonster"},"sources":["2104","2166"],"statblock_names":[],"title":"Thessalmonster","prev_key":"theseadr","next_key":"thespide","monster_path":"/appendix/thesmons"}},"staticQueryHashes":[],"slicesMap":{}}
