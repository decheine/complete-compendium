While the powers listed above are the most common, some aarakocra have different or additional powers.</p><p class=\"f\">A race of intelligent, birdlike creatures living in the deepest deserts of Athas, the rare Athasian <a href=\"/appendix/aarakocr\">aarakocra</a> spends its time soaring on thermals in search of food.</p><p>The aarakocra is 7 to 8 feet tall with a wingspan of 20 feet or more. Because of its large wingspan, an aarakocra can carry as much as 75% of its own body weight and still fly easily. An aarakocra can fly a short distance carrying a burden equaling 125% of its own body weight. The average body weight of a full grown male is 100 pounds and a female is 85 pounds.</p><p>Each wing has a &ldquo;hand&rdquo; at its midpoint, consisting of three fingers and an opposable thumb. The fourth finger forms the rigid leading edge of the wing. In flight the hands cannot be used, but on the ground the aarakocra can use its hands almost as a human would. The aarakocra's body is protected by a thin bony plate on the chest, much like a solid rib cage. Talons on its legs can be used as claws and can be retracted to reveal a second set of hands, also with three fingers and an opposable thumb. Except for the chest plate, the entire skeleton is hollow and extremely fragile.</p><p>From a distance, the Athasian aarakocra resembles a huge <a href=\"/appendix/bird\">vulture</a>. Its black eyes, set in the front of the head, provide excellent vision over a long range. The plumage is generally black with a white collar for adult males and black or brown with a smaller white collar for females. Adolescents are a mixture of brown and black. The beak is large and covers most of the head. Plumage begins at the crown of the head and is darker near the head, except for the collar. Athasian aarakocra speak their own language and the languages of vultures and other large birds. Some speak the common tongue (5% to 10% chance depending on how deep in the wastelands a tribe lives).</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Combat:</b> Aarakocra can fight in the air or on the ground. They prefer aerial combat since their bones are too fragile to withstand a solid blow from a human-sized opponent. In combat against creatures on the ground, they prefer to fly over their victim and drop weighted nets. Some aarakocra use darts to harass ground-based opponents.</p><p>If their opponents can fly, the aarakocra generally forgo the use of the net, although large groups sometimes use nets on flying creatures. Normally, aarakocra attack flying creatures with long spears, diving from above and allowing the momentum to carry the spear through the target. Such an attack doubles the damage if the aarakocra have been able to dive at least 50 feet. Only the very largest aarakocra can carry more than one of these spears, they can attack with both at once with no penalty, causing double damage on each strike. All diving attacks are made at +4 and should be treated as a charge attack. All other penalties and restrictions of charge attacks apply.</p><p>The effect of the aarakocra's nets depends on if the opponent is flying at the time it becomes entangled. Creatures on the ground that are hit by a net are entangled and unable to participate in any combat until they make a successful Strength check to get free of the net. Flying creatures hit by a net can no longer fly and immediately begin falling. If they cannot escape the net or use some magical means to arrest the fall, normal falling damage applies.</p><p>Unless victims are entangled in nets, aarakocra are cautious in ground combat. If the aarakocra outnumber their opponents they advance in a straight line and thrust with their spears. If outnumbered, or the opponents are particularly tough, the aarakocra withdraw. Victims entangled in nets are killed or incapacitated for use as food or ransom.</p><p>Athasian aarakocra are mindful of their physical limitations as well as their comparatively low psionic abilities. They do not normally initiate psionic combat. At the first sign of psionic powers from any of their victims, however, all aarakocra that have some ability will use whatever attack and defense modes they can in an attempt to destroy the threat. Large groups of is or more aarakocra may initiate psionic combat if their leaders feel they can win quickly and avoid physical combat.</p><p>In desperation, an aarakocra can attempt to bite an opponent in combat. Because of the unwieldiness of its beak, the aarakocra has a THAC0 of 18 if attacking with this appendage. Further, the birdman causes only 1d2 points of damage with the beak.</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Habitat/Society:</b> Athasian aarakocra live in tribes with 6-20 (2d8+4) members, depending on the prestige of the leader. The largest tribe ever recorded had 50 members. The tribal hunting territory depends on the size of the tribe, usually about 500 square miles for a tribe of 10 members. There are no rigid boundaries between tribes and border disputes are not uncommon.</p><p>Alignments of tribe members are similar to the alignment of the leader. A tribe that has a leader who is neutral good may have neutral good, chaotic good, lawful good, and true neutral members. A predominantly evil tribe does not recognize boundaries with other tribes and treats other tribes as inferior beings to be eliminated.</p><p>Athasian aarakocra aren't happy in enclosed spaces, but they they take refuge in a cave or building if necessary.</p><p>Nonevil tribes live in rocky aeries in the highest peaks they can find. Evil tribes are normally nomadic and use an aerie made by another tribe if they need to remain in an area for a long time, even if they have to evict the tribe that made the nest.</p><p>Aarakocra aren't friendly toward intruders in their territory, especially caravans. They try to extract a toll from the caravan for passage through the desert. Good-aligned tribes allow unhindered passage of caravans that pay a tribute. If someone refuses to pay the tribute, the aarakocra try to capture scouts or outriders from the party and hold them until an even larger tribute is paid. The payment may be either livestock or shiny objects. Aarakocra are smart enough not to be taken in by glass baubles instead of gems, although they cannot tell the difference between the more common gems and the rare ones.</p><p>Evil tribes ask for tribute and often attack a caravan whether it pays or not. Aarakocra always demand shiny objects such as stones. These tribes find humans and demihumans to be quite tasty and prefer them to other food.</p><p>Good-aligned tribes of aarakocra sometimes return a lost traveler to the edge of the desert after first removing any valuables the traveler may be carrying. On very rare occasions a tribe might return a lost group of travelers to the more frequently traveled parts of the desert, again after first taking any valuables as payment.</p><p>The oldest male is the leader of the tribal hunting party and has 4+4 Hit Dice. The oldest female is in charge of the tribal aerie and has 3+3 HD. In tribes that have more than 15 members, the next oldest aarakocra serves as shaman and has 3+3 HD; the shaman completes the triumvirate necessary for proper worship and the summoning of elementals. (Interestingly, no magic-using aarakocra has ever been recorded.) Tribes without a shaman cannot summon <a href=\"/appendix/element1\">air elementals</a>, which is an important part of aarakocra culture.</p><p>The shaman is the leader of the daily sun worship. Aarakocra worship the sun because it provides them with the thermals they need to soar in search of food. The shaman also leads the mystic rituals used to summon an air elemental. Summoning an air elemental is usually done only in preparation for the tribe's most sacred ceremony, the hunt. Small tribes must band together for this ceremony to allow the triumvirate to be formed.</p><p>The ceremony to summon an air elemental must be conducted at dawn and requires the oldest male and female to emit a highpitched keening whistle. The shaman conducts an intricate dance around them, simultaneously chanting an ancient summoning mantra.</p><p>The hunt is the final part of the initiation of adolescent aarakocra to adulthood and often takes the tribe far from their normal teritory. The target is always a <a href=\"/appendix/drakalsi\">silt drake</a>. The hunt is the only time the females leave the relative safety of the nest. Even an evil tribe will not interfere with a tribe on a hunt. An air elemental is often summoned to help find the drake, but never takes part in the actual combat. Although the adult members of the tribe take part in the initial phases of the combat, it is the initiates who deliver the final, killing blows to me drake. Scars from the hunt are considered a mark of pride among all aarakocra.</p><p>The females spend about eight months of the year incubating their eggs. Athasian aarakocra mate for life and a pair normally produces as many as 10 offspring. A female lays one egg a year. Constant incubation is not required because of the high daytime temperatures, so the females can maintain the nest and keep the tribe's treasure in order.</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Ecology:</b> Athasian aarakocra are high on the food chain and have no natural enemies other than <a href=\"/appendix/drakatha\">drakes</a>. Unless evil, aarakocra leave their own territory only to hunt the silt drake and return as soon as possible when the hunt is over. (Evil aarakocra attack others, as noted above.) Aarakocra eggs and hatchlings are sought after by wealthy land owners who wish to use the creatures as scouts and sentries. An egg can bring as much as 10 cp in Tyr's marketplace. Tribes that have had eggs or hatchlings stolen have long memories and sometimes take revenge against the thief at a later date. Captive aarakocra join any tribe they come in contact with.</p><p>Athasian aarakocra have a natural life span of 21-30 years.</p><p></p><br clear=\"all\" style=\"clear:both; height:0;\">\r\n","images":["<img src=\"grf/ds.gif\" width=\"150\" height=\"75\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Dark Sun\" title=\"Dark Sun\" align=\"right\">","<img src=\"img/aarakath.gif\" alt=\"Aarakocra (Athas)\" title=\"Aarakocra (Athas)\" border=\"0\" width=\"300\" height=\"360\" style=\"text-align:right;\" align=\"right\">","<img src=\"grf/add2_01.gif\" width=\"200\" height=\"56\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Advanced Dungeons & Dragons 2nd Edition\">"],"setting":"Dark Sun","statblock":{"Aarakocra (Athas)":{"Activity Cycle":"Day","Alignment":"Any","Armor Class":"7","Climate/Terrain":"Deep desert","Damage/Attack":"1d3/1d3 or by weapon","Diet":"Carnivore","Frequency":"Rare","Hit Dice":"2+2","Intelligence":"Average (8-10)","Magic Resistance":"Nil","Morale":"Steady (11)","Movement":"6, Fl 36 (C)","No. Appearing":"1d10","No. of Attacks":"2","Organization":"Tribal","Size":"M (20'+ wingspan)","Special Attacks":"Nil","Special Defenses":"Nil","THAC0":"17","Treasure":"Varies","XP Value":"65"}},"title":"Aarakocra (Athas)"},"sources":["2433"],"statblock_names":[],"title":"Aarakocra (Athas)","prev_key":"zygraat","next_key":"aarakocr","monster_path":"/appendix/aarakath"}}},"pageContext":{"monster_key":"duruchil","monster_data":{"TSR":["2116","9258"],"fullBody":"  <table cellspacing=\"0\" cellpadding=\"0\"><tr class=\"bk\"><th> </th><th class=\"cn\">Ch'i-lin</th><th class=\"cn\">Duru</th></tr><tr><th>Climate/Terrain:</th><td>Temperate forests</td><td>Temperate forests</td></tr><tr><th>Frequency:</th><td>Very rare</td><td>Very rare</td></tr><tr><th>Organization:</th><td>Solitary</td><td>Solitary</td></tr><tr><th>Activity Cycle:</th><td>Any</td><td>Any</td></tr><tr><th>Diet:</th><td>Special</td><td>Special</td></tr><tr><th>Intelligence:</th><td>Genius (18)</td><td>Genius (18)</td></tr><tr><th>Treasure:</th><td>Nil</td><td>Nil</td></tr><tr><th>Alignment:</th><td>Lawful good</td><td>Lawful good</td></tr><tr><th>No. Appearing:</th><td>1</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><th>Armor Class:</th><td>-2</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><th>Movement:</th><td>24 (ground or water), Fl 36</td><td>36 (ground, water, clouds), Fl 48</td></tr><tr><th>Hit Dice:</th><td>16</td><td>13</td></tr><tr><th>THAC0:</th><td>7</td><td>7</td></tr><tr><th>No. of Attacks:</th><td>3</td><td>3</td></tr><tr><th>Damage/Attack:</th><td>1-10/1-10/3-18</td><td>1-6/1-6/2-12</td></tr><tr><th>Special Attacks:</th><td>See below</td><td>See below</td></tr><tr><th>Special Defenses:</th><td>See below</td><td>See below</td></tr><tr><th>Magic Resistance:</th><td>See below</td><td>See below</td></tr><tr><th>Size:</th><td>G (75')</td><td>G (60')</td></tr><tr><th>Morale:</th><td>Fanatic (18)</td><td>Fanatic (18)</td></tr><tr><th>XP Value:</th><td>18,000</td><td>15,000</td></tr></table><p class=\"f\"><img src=\"/img/spc/chilin.gif\" width=\"300\" height=\"360\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Ch'i-lin\" title=\\Ch'i-lin\" style=\"float:left;\">The duruch'i-lin, also known as the oriental <a href=\"/appendix/unicorn\">unicorn</a>, is among the world's most beloved creatures. Though it is seldom seen by man, its appearance is always associated with longevity, health, and good fortune. The female duruch'i-lin is a &ldquo;ch'i-1in.&rdquo; The male is a &ldquo;duru.&rdquo;</p><p>A ch'i-lin is larger and more powerful than her male counterpart.Superficially, the ch'i-lin resembles a giant version of the common unicorn. It is not unusual for a ch'i-lin to attain a height of 100 feet or more, though it is more commonly 50-75 feet tall. The ch'i-lin's coat is a riot of color, seemingly random splotches of red, yellow, black, white, and blue, though its belly is always brilliant yellow. Its body is thicker than that of a common unicorn. It has the tail of a horse and the long jaws of a wolf. It has a blunt, fleshy horn about 5 feet long extending from its forehead. Its voice sounds like the tinkling of silver bells. The ch'i-lin can speak all human languages, as well as the languages of all forest creatures.</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Combat:</b> Ch'i-lin are normally passive and docile, resorting to violence only as a last resort. Their horns are too blunt to be used as weapons, but they can use them to fire six <i>magic bolts</i> per round, with each aimed at a different target. A ch'i-lin's <i>magic bolts</i> are +4 to hit and cause 3-18 (3d6) hit points of damage. They can <i>plane shift</i> and <i>become invisible</i> at will; and can cast <i>crystalbrittle</i> and <i>bless</i> each once per round. A character who touches the horn of a living ch'i-lin gains the ability to cast an <i>omen</i> spell; this ability lasts for one hour. Though loathe to engage in physical combat, ch'i-lin can inflict 1-10 hit points of damage from two hoof attacks and 3-18 (3d6) hit points of damage from a bite.</p><p>Ch'i-lin are immune to all poisons, as well as <i>death</i>, <i>charm</i>, and <i>hold</i> spells, and make their saving throws as if they were 20th level wizards. They are surrounded by an aura of golden flame that acts as a permanent <i>deflection</i> spell. Ch'i-lin can walk on water as easily as they can walk on land.</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Habitat/Society:</b> Ch'i-lin have an affinity for all living creatures, particularly those of the forests with whom they share a strong bond of friendship and trust. They have no permanent lair, preferring to roam from forest to forest in the company of their animal friends. Ch'i-lin never acquire treasure. When ch'i-lin desire privacy, they usually <i>plane shift</i> to another plane of existance where they may meditate in solitude for up to 10 years at a time. Ch'i-lin tend to shun the civilized world, but they often make an appearance when an especially benevolent ruler or wise sage is about to be born.</p><p>The first ch'i-lin was formed from the blended bodies of two now extinct creatures, the ch'i (a stag with silver antlers and emerald eyes) and the lin (a war horse with a golden coat whose every step cracked the earth). The ch'i-lin rose from the waters of Wa's Akano River, appearing to Emperor Kochi in the 1st Year of Chiso. On the back of the ch'i-lin was a detailed series of written characters; it is said that the language of Wa evolved from Emperor Kochi's transcription of these characters.</p><p>The courtship ritual of the ch'i-lin is a long and complex process. When a male ch'i-lin selects a suitable mate, he introduces her to an assembly of forest animals including at least one representative of every species in his territory, usually an area no less than 10,000 square miles. If the animals accept her, the male then introduces her to representatives of the Celestial Bureaucracy. If they approve the mating, the pair retires to another plane of existence where they spend no less than five years sharing every detail of their life histories. The female gives birth to a single infant. The pair raise the infant in this alternate plane until it reaches maturity (about 50 years), at which time all members of the family go their own way.</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Ecology:</b> Ch'i-lin seldom walk on the ground, fearing they will accidently trample an innocent insect or damage the vegetation. They eat only minerals and drink only from the purest of streams. Its horn, when ground into a powder, can be used as an antidote for any poison. Their coats retain the properties of <i>deflection</i> even after their death, and are highly prized as material for protective clothing.</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Duru</b></p>  <p class=\"ni\">The duru is a smaller, faster, and less powerful version of the ch'ilin. He is identical in outlook and appearance to his female counterpart, except that his belly is blue and his protective aura is silver. He fires only three magic bolts per round, which have a +2 to-hit bonus and cause 2-12 (2d6) points of damage.</p><p>The courtship ritual of the duru is long and complex. When a duru finds an agreeable ch'i-lin, he introduces her to an assembly of forest animals, including at least one representative of every species in his territory. (The territory usually covers 10,000 sq. miles or more.) If the animals accept her, the male then introduces the chi'i-lin to representatives of the Celestial Bureaucracy. If they approve of the mating, the pair retires to another plane of existence, where they spend no less than five years sharing every detail of their life histories. The couple gives birth to a single infant, raising it in this alternate plane until it reaches maturity (about 50 years). When the child has matured, all members of the family go their own way.</p><p></p><br clear=\"all\" style=\"clear:both; height:0;\">\r\n","images":["<img src=\"grf/kt.gif\" width=\"150\" height=\"75\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Kara-Tur (Forgotten Realms)\" title=\"Kara-Tur (Forgotten Realms)\" align=\"right\">","<img src=\"img/duruchil.gif\" alt=\"Duruch'i-lin\" title=\"Duruch'i-lin\" border=\"0\" width=\"300\" height=\"360\" style=\"text-align:right;\" align=\"right\">","<img src=\"/img/spc/chilin.gif\" width=\"300\" height=\"360\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Ch'i-lin\" title=\\Ch'i-lin\" style=\"float:left;\">","<img src=\"grf/add2_01.gif\" width=\"200\" height=\"56\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Advanced Dungeons & Dragons 2nd Edition\">"],"setting":"Kara-Tur (Forgotten Realms)","statblock":{"Ch'i-lin":{"Activity Cycle":"Any","Alignment":"Lawful good","Armor Class":"-2","Climate/Terrain":"Temperate forests","Damage/Attack":"1-10/1-10/3-18","Diet":"Special","Frequency":"Very rare","Hit Dice":"16","Intelligence":"Genius (18)","Magic Resistance":"See below","Morale":"Fanatic (18)","Movement":"24 (ground or water), Fl 36","No. Appearing":"1","No. of Attacks":"3","Organization":"Solitary","Size":"G (75')","Special Attacks":"See below","Special Defenses":"See below","THAC0":"7","Treasure":"Nil","XP Value":"18,000"},"Duru":{"Activity Cycle":"Any","Alignment":"Lawful good","Armor Class":"0","Climate/Terrain":"Temperate forests","Damage/Attack":"1-6/1-6/2-12","Diet":"Special","Frequency":"Very rare","Hit Dice":"13","Intelligence":"Genius (18)","Magic Resistance":"See below","Morale":"Fanatic (18)","Movement":"36 (ground, water, clouds), Fl 48","No. Appearing":"1","No. of Attacks":"3","Organization":"Solitary","Size":"G (60')","Special Attacks":"See below","Special Defenses":"See below","THAC0":"7","Treasure":"Nil","XP Value":"15,000"}},"title":"Duruch'i-lin"},"sources":["2116","9258"],"statblock_names":[],"title":"Duruch'i-lin","prev_key":"dunetrap","next_key":"dusanu","monster_path":"/appendix/duruchil"}},"staticQueryHashes":[],"slicesMap":{}}
