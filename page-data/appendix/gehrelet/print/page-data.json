While the powers listed above are the most common, some aarakocra have different or additional powers.</p><p class=\"f\">A race of intelligent, birdlike creatures living in the deepest deserts of Athas, the rare Athasian <a href=\"/appendix/aarakocr\">aarakocra</a> spends its time soaring on thermals in search of food.</p><p>The aarakocra is 7 to 8 feet tall with a wingspan of 20 feet or more. Because of its large wingspan, an aarakocra can carry as much as 75% of its own body weight and still fly easily. An aarakocra can fly a short distance carrying a burden equaling 125% of its own body weight. The average body weight of a full grown male is 100 pounds and a female is 85 pounds.</p><p>Each wing has a &ldquo;hand&rdquo; at its midpoint, consisting of three fingers and an opposable thumb. The fourth finger forms the rigid leading edge of the wing. In flight the hands cannot be used, but on the ground the aarakocra can use its hands almost as a human would. The aarakocra's body is protected by a thin bony plate on the chest, much like a solid rib cage. Talons on its legs can be used as claws and can be retracted to reveal a second set of hands, also with three fingers and an opposable thumb. Except for the chest plate, the entire skeleton is hollow and extremely fragile.</p><p>From a distance, the Athasian aarakocra resembles a huge <a href=\"/appendix/bird\">vulture</a>. Its black eyes, set in the front of the head, provide excellent vision over a long range. The plumage is generally black with a white collar for adult males and black or brown with a smaller white collar for females. Adolescents are a mixture of brown and black. The beak is large and covers most of the head. Plumage begins at the crown of the head and is darker near the head, except for the collar. Athasian aarakocra speak their own language and the languages of vultures and other large birds. Some speak the common tongue (5% to 10% chance depending on how deep in the wastelands a tribe lives).</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Combat:</b> Aarakocra can fight in the air or on the ground. They prefer aerial combat since their bones are too fragile to withstand a solid blow from a human-sized opponent. In combat against creatures on the ground, they prefer to fly over their victim and drop weighted nets. Some aarakocra use darts to harass ground-based opponents.</p><p>If their opponents can fly, the aarakocra generally forgo the use of the net, although large groups sometimes use nets on flying creatures. Normally, aarakocra attack flying creatures with long spears, diving from above and allowing the momentum to carry the spear through the target. Such an attack doubles the damage if the aarakocra have been able to dive at least 50 feet. Only the very largest aarakocra can carry more than one of these spears, they can attack with both at once with no penalty, causing double damage on each strike. All diving attacks are made at +4 and should be treated as a charge attack. All other penalties and restrictions of charge attacks apply.</p><p>The effect of the aarakocra's nets depends on if the opponent is flying at the time it becomes entangled. Creatures on the ground that are hit by a net are entangled and unable to participate in any combat until they make a successful Strength check to get free of the net. Flying creatures hit by a net can no longer fly and immediately begin falling. If they cannot escape the net or use some magical means to arrest the fall, normal falling damage applies.</p><p>Unless victims are entangled in nets, aarakocra are cautious in ground combat. If the aarakocra outnumber their opponents they advance in a straight line and thrust with their spears. If outnumbered, or the opponents are particularly tough, the aarakocra withdraw. Victims entangled in nets are killed or incapacitated for use as food or ransom.</p><p>Athasian aarakocra are mindful of their physical limitations as well as their comparatively low psionic abilities. They do not normally initiate psionic combat. At the first sign of psionic powers from any of their victims, however, all aarakocra that have some ability will use whatever attack and defense modes they can in an attempt to destroy the threat. Large groups of is or more aarakocra may initiate psionic combat if their leaders feel they can win quickly and avoid physical combat.</p><p>In desperation, an aarakocra can attempt to bite an opponent in combat. Because of the unwieldiness of its beak, the aarakocra has a THAC0 of 18 if attacking with this appendage. Further, the birdman causes only 1d2 points of damage with the beak.</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Habitat/Society:</b> Athasian aarakocra live in tribes with 6-20 (2d8+4) members, depending on the prestige of the leader. The largest tribe ever recorded had 50 members. The tribal hunting territory depends on the size of the tribe, usually about 500 square miles for a tribe of 10 members. There are no rigid boundaries between tribes and border disputes are not uncommon.</p><p>Alignments of tribe members are similar to the alignment of the leader. A tribe that has a leader who is neutral good may have neutral good, chaotic good, lawful good, and true neutral members. A predominantly evil tribe does not recognize boundaries with other tribes and treats other tribes as inferior beings to be eliminated.</p><p>Athasian aarakocra aren't happy in enclosed spaces, but they they take refuge in a cave or building if necessary.</p><p>Nonevil tribes live in rocky aeries in the highest peaks they can find. Evil tribes are normally nomadic and use an aerie made by another tribe if they need to remain in an area for a long time, even if they have to evict the tribe that made the nest.</p><p>Aarakocra aren't friendly toward intruders in their territory, especially caravans. They try to extract a toll from the caravan for passage through the desert. Good-aligned tribes allow unhindered passage of caravans that pay a tribute. If someone refuses to pay the tribute, the aarakocra try to capture scouts or outriders from the party and hold them until an even larger tribute is paid. The payment may be either livestock or shiny objects. Aarakocra are smart enough not to be taken in by glass baubles instead of gems, although they cannot tell the difference between the more common gems and the rare ones.</p><p>Evil tribes ask for tribute and often attack a caravan whether it pays or not. Aarakocra always demand shiny objects such as stones. These tribes find humans and demihumans to be quite tasty and prefer them to other food.</p><p>Good-aligned tribes of aarakocra sometimes return a lost traveler to the edge of the desert after first removing any valuables the traveler may be carrying. On very rare occasions a tribe might return a lost group of travelers to the more frequently traveled parts of the desert, again after first taking any valuables as payment.</p><p>The oldest male is the leader of the tribal hunting party and has 4+4 Hit Dice. The oldest female is in charge of the tribal aerie and has 3+3 HD. In tribes that have more than 15 members, the next oldest aarakocra serves as shaman and has 3+3 HD; the shaman completes the triumvirate necessary for proper worship and the summoning of elementals. (Interestingly, no magic-using aarakocra has ever been recorded.) Tribes without a shaman cannot summon <a href=\"/appendix/element1\">air elementals</a>, which is an important part of aarakocra culture.</p><p>The shaman is the leader of the daily sun worship. Aarakocra worship the sun because it provides them with the thermals they need to soar in search of food. The shaman also leads the mystic rituals used to summon an air elemental. Summoning an air elemental is usually done only in preparation for the tribe's most sacred ceremony, the hunt. Small tribes must band together for this ceremony to allow the triumvirate to be formed.</p><p>The ceremony to summon an air elemental must be conducted at dawn and requires the oldest male and female to emit a highpitched keening whistle. The shaman conducts an intricate dance around them, simultaneously chanting an ancient summoning mantra.</p><p>The hunt is the final part of the initiation of adolescent aarakocra to adulthood and often takes the tribe far from their normal teritory. The target is always a <a href=\"/appendix/drakalsi\">silt drake</a>. The hunt is the only time the females leave the relative safety of the nest. Even an evil tribe will not interfere with a tribe on a hunt. An air elemental is often summoned to help find the drake, but never takes part in the actual combat. Although the adult members of the tribe take part in the initial phases of the combat, it is the initiates who deliver the final, killing blows to me drake. Scars from the hunt are considered a mark of pride among all aarakocra.</p><p>The females spend about eight months of the year incubating their eggs. Athasian aarakocra mate for life and a pair normally produces as many as 10 offspring. A female lays one egg a year. Constant incubation is not required because of the high daytime temperatures, so the females can maintain the nest and keep the tribe's treasure in order.</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Ecology:</b> Athasian aarakocra are high on the food chain and have no natural enemies other than <a href=\"/appendix/drakatha\">drakes</a>. Unless evil, aarakocra leave their own territory only to hunt the silt drake and return as soon as possible when the hunt is over. (Evil aarakocra attack others, as noted above.) Aarakocra eggs and hatchlings are sought after by wealthy land owners who wish to use the creatures as scouts and sentries. An egg can bring as much as 10 cp in Tyr's marketplace. Tribes that have had eggs or hatchlings stolen have long memories and sometimes take revenge against the thief at a later date. Captive aarakocra join any tribe they come in contact with.</p><p>Athasian aarakocra have a natural life span of 21-30 years.</p><p></p><br clear=\"all\" style=\"clear:both; height:0;\">\r\n","images":["<img src=\"grf/ds.gif\" width=\"150\" height=\"75\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Dark Sun\" title=\"Dark Sun\" align=\"right\">","<img src=\"img/aarakath.gif\" alt=\"Aarakocra (Athas)\" title=\"Aarakocra (Athas)\" border=\"0\" width=\"300\" height=\"360\" style=\"text-align:right;\" align=\"right\">","<img src=\"grf/add2_01.gif\" width=\"200\" height=\"56\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Advanced Dungeons & Dragons 2nd Edition\">"],"setting":"Dark Sun","statblock":{"Aarakocra (Athas)":{"Activity Cycle":"Day","Alignment":"Any","Armor Class":"7","Climate/Terrain":"Deep desert","Damage/Attack":"1d3/1d3 or by weapon","Diet":"Carnivore","Frequency":"Rare","Hit Dice":"2+2","Intelligence":"Average (8-10)","Magic Resistance":"Nil","Morale":"Steady (11)","Movement":"6, Fl 36 (C)","No. Appearing":"1d10","No. of Attacks":"2","Organization":"Tribal","Size":"M (20'+ wingspan)","Special Attacks":"Nil","Special Defenses":"Nil","THAC0":"17","Treasure":"Varies","XP Value":"65"}},"title":"Aarakocra (Athas)"},"sources":["2433"],"statblock_names":[],"title":"Aarakocra (Athas)","prev_key":"zygraat","next_key":"aarakocr","monster_path":"/appendix/aarakath"}}},"pageContext":{"monster_key":"gehrelet","monster_data":{"TSR":["2118","2602"],"fullBody":"  <table cellspacing=\"0\" cellpadding=\"0\"><tr class=\"bk\"><th> </th><th class=\"cn\">Farastu</th><th class=\"cn\">Kelubar</th><th class=\"cn\">Shator</th></tr><tr><th>Climate/Terrain:</th><td>Carceri</td><td>Carceri</td><td>Carceri</td></tr><tr><th>Frequency:</th><td>Very rare</td><td>Very rare</td><td>Very rare</td></tr><tr><th>Organization:</th><td>Solitary</td><td>Solitary</td><td>Solitary</td></tr><tr><th>Activity Cycle:</th><td>Any</td><td>Any</td><td>Any</td></tr><tr><th>Diet:</th><td>Carnivore</td><td>Carnivore</td><td>Carnivore</td></tr><tr><th>Intelligence:</th><td>Average (8-10)</td><td>Very (11-12)</td><td>Genius (17-18)</td></tr><tr><th>Treasure:</th><td>Nil</td><td>Nil</td><td>Nil</td></tr><tr><th>Alignment:</th><td>Chaotic evil</td><td>Chaotic evil</td><td>Chaotic evil</td></tr><tr><th>No. Appearing:</th><td>1</td><td>1</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><th>Armor Class:</th><td>-1</td><td>-2</td><td>-3</td></tr><tr><th>Movement:</th><td>15, Fl 30 (C)</td><td>12, Fl 24 (C)</td><td>9, Fl 18 (C)</td></tr><tr><th>Hit Dice:</th><td>11</td><td>13</td><td>15</td></tr><tr><th>THAC0:</th><td>9</td><td>7</td><td>5</td></tr><tr><th>No. of Attacks:</th><td>3</td><td>3</td><td>3</td></tr><tr><th>Damage/Attack:</th><td>1d6+1/1dG+1/3d4 or weapon +7 (Strength bonus)</td><td>2d4/2d4/4d4 or weapon +9 (Strength bonus)</td><td>1d6+1/1d6+1/3d4 or weapon +9 (Strength bonus)</td></tr><tr><th>Special Attacks:</th><td>Battle frenzy, adhesive</td><td>Stench, acidic slime</td><td>Magical weapons</td></tr><tr><th>Special Defenses:</th><td>Adhesive, +1 or better weapons to hit</td><td>+2 or better weapons to hit</td><td>Immune to nonmagical attacks, +3 or better weapons to hit, +2 to surprise rolls</td></tr><tr><th>Magic Resistance:</th><td>50%</td><td>50%</td><td>50%</td></tr><tr><th>Size:</th><td>M (7' tall)</td><td>M (6½'tall)</td><td>M (6' tall)</td></tr><tr><th>Morale:</th><td>Champion (15-16)</td><td>Champion (15-16)</td><td>Fanatic (17-18)</td></tr><tr><th>XP Value:</th><td>14,000</td><td>17,000</td><td>22,000</td></tr></table><p class=\"f\">Among the forbidden books in the library of Everhaite is a text on gehreleth society, <i>The Three Bodies of Evil</i> by Carlvian Everhaite, an otherwise anonymous <a href=\"/appendix/elfdrow\">drow</a> wizard. Fragments of the text are known to men, notably a poetic redaction entitled <i>Calls of ye Lower Planes</i> by Nephrosis Curwen. Here are some of his remarks on gehreleth society.</p><p>&ldquo;The Gehreleth are known to worship or honor a patron deity called Apomps, the Three-sided One. This entity not only can manifest as any of the three Gehreleth races, it is in fact directly supposed to be the father and promoter of each Gehreleth. The Three-sided One breathes life into the fallen and rotting corpses of those foolish enough to venture into the Lower Planes transforming them into Farastu. This entity presents each of the Gehreleth an obsidian triangle, which is considered the personal link they have with Him. This is their only loyalty. Should the triangle for any reason be taken from them, they will do much to retrieve it. Possession of the triangle, I suspect, allows each Gehreleth to posses the memories of the whole race to a limited extent. They know who has summoned others of their kind, and their plans of revenge can span the lives of many individuals.</p><p>&ldquo;Each of the races has certain peculiarities. The Farastu and the Kelubar can undergo a lengthy and painful process of self-liquefaction into the secretion they most frequently exude. These pools of tar and slime can be bottled and stored for centuries as a kind of �instant army'.</p><p>&ldquo;The Farastu, if they are not banished after summoning, delight in setting themselves up as kings of stupid, easily bullied inhabitants of the local plane. The Farastu pursue this promotion as compensation for the servility they must observe in the Lower Planes. It is believed that the Three-sided One promotes this practice, as it permits him to know of the goings-on on other planes. Apomps seldom promotes a Farastu on any plane save for Carceri.</p><p>&ldquo;The Kelubar are mad for wands and other small handheld magical items. By sneaking such easily concealed magical items back to the Lower Planes, the Kelubar can gain an important edge in the power struggles that characterize Gehreleth society.</p><p>&ldquo;The Shator often travel to other planes for their favorite occupation - writing. Shator works are of two categories: magical texts on how to summon creatures from the Lower Planes other than Gehreleth (usually named creatures that the Gehreleth have some particular hatred for), and philosophical texts that promote ideas of futility and cosmic angst. When dwelling in the Prime Material Plane, the Shator hide behind a human whom they set up a philosopher or poet. These men and women come to bad ends when the Shator has decided that its mission is done.</p><p>&ldquo;When dwelling on other planes, the Shators' favorite pets are <a href=\"/appendix/chimera\">chimerae</a>. Oddly, they sometimes show concern for these beings, treating them like a human treats a kitten.&rdquo;</p><p>Gehreleths inhabit Carceri, part of the killing grounds in the eternal Blood War. However, these fiends take no part in the conflict, instead roaming Carceri as random agents of destruction. Gehreleths look disgusting and unsightly.</p><p>Gehreleths speak a guttural language of their own, but use their <i>tongues</i> ability to communicate with others.</p><h2><img src=\"/img/spc/gehrfara.gif\" width=\"300\" height=\"360\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Farastu\" t=\"Farastu\" style=\"float:right;\">Farastu</h2><p class=\"f\">The farastu are tall, slender humanoids with long arms and heads. Their Strength is 19 (+7 damage adjustment), and they weigh about 420 pounds. They are the commoners of Carceri.</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Combat:</b> Farastu are wicked things that attack any nongehreleth they encounter. They often fight to the death, ignoring morale rolls.</p><p>Although the vile farastu have several spell-like and special abilities, they prefer to enter combat with their two claws (1d6+1 damage) and fangs (3d4 damage).</p><p>A farastu reaches a battle frenzy after six rounds of combat or when reduced to half normal hit points. In a frenzy the farastu doubles its number of normal attacks, and all attacks get a +2 bonus.</p><p>Farastu gehreleths secrete a black, tarlike substance that is slightly adhesive (5% chance that anything it touches sticks). If an attacking farastu sticks to its opponent, the opponent gains another attack sequence immediately. If an attacking opponent sticks to the farastu, the farastu gains a +4 attack roll bonus and the stuck opponent loses initiative. If a weapon sticks to the farastu, there is a 25% chance that it is jerked from the attacker's grip. It takes one round to pull away a stuck weapon.</p><p>A farastu can employ the following spell-like powers at 11th level of spell use, one at a time, once per round: <i>detect good</i>, <i>detect invisibility</i>, <i>detect magic</i>, <i>dispel magic</i> (twice per day), <i>ESP</i>, <i>fear</i>, <i>fog cloud</i> (3 times per day), <i>invisibility</i>, <i>tongues</i>, and <i>weakness</i> (reverse of strength, 3 times per day). Farastu gehreleths can <i>gate</i> in 1-2 additional farastu once per day with a 40% chance of success.</p><p>Farastu are harmed only by +1 or hetter weapons. Acid or poison have no effect. Farastu gehreleth take half damage from cold- and fire-based attacks. They are immune to fear of all types, as well as all illusions and phantasms. Farastu have 120' infravision.</p><h2><img src=\"/img/spc/gehrkelu.gif\" width=\"300\" height=\"360\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Kelubar\" t=\"Kelubar\" style=\"float:left;\">Kelubar</h2><p class=\"f\">Kelubar are slimy, ebon humanoids, shorter than farastu and thicker in the lower torso and limbs. Their hands are large and their huge heads oval: the horizontal axis is longest. Their effective Strength is 20 (+8 damage adjustment), and they weigh close to 500 pounds. They are the middle class of Carceri.</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Combat:</b> Kelubar are known as &ldquo;slime gehreleths&rdquo; because their skin constantly exudes a slimy secretion with a debilitating odor. Anyone within 30 feet of a kelubar in combat must successfully save vs. poison or be incapacitated for 1-10 melee rounds.</p><p>Kelubar attack with their nails (2d4 damage) and teeth (4d4 damage). In addition, each attack inflicts 1d6 damage due to the acidic nature of the kelubar's slime (save vs. poison for half damage).</p><p>Kelubar can employ all of the spell-like abilities available to farastu, plus these, at 13th level of spell use: <i>ray of enfeeblement</i> (once per day) and <i>spider climb</i>. Once per day a kelubar can attempt to <i>gate</i> in 1-2 additional kelubar (40% chance) or 1-2 farastu (60% chance).</p><p>Kelubar are completely immune to fire, acid, cold-based, and poison attacks. Weapons of less than +2 enchantment do no harm. They have infravision to 120'.</p><h2><img src=\"/img/spc/gehrshat.gif\" width=\"300\" height=\"360\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Shator\" t=\"Shator\" style=\"float:right;\">Shator</h2><p class=\"f\">Shator are 6' tall, squat and broad. Their humanoid form appears draped in shaggy skins. Their huge heads are mostly mouth, with jaws like a giant bulldog. Their Strength is 21 (+9 damage adjustment), and they weigh 560 pounds. Shators are the nobility of Carceri.</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Combat:</b> The greatest of the gehreleths, shators are the most intelligent and cunning of the gehreleths. In combat they choose their best option, often favoring their spell-like abilities over physical attacks and retreating from stronger opponents. Due to their sharp senses shators have a +2 bonus on their surprise rolls.</p><p>Shators attack with two claws (1d8+1 damage) and bite (5d4 damage). They can also wield weapons (45% chance for magical weapon). Both weapon and natural attacks gain Strength bonuses.</p><p>Shators can use all the spell-like abilities available to the farastu, plus the following, at 15th level of spell use: <i>beguile</i> (as a <i>rod of beguiling</i>, once per day), <i>cloudkill</i> (once per day), <i>ray of enfeeblement</i> (3 times per day), and <i>stinking cloud</i> (3 times per day). A shator can always <i>gate</i> in either 1-6 farastu or 1-4 kelubar. They have a 30% chance to summon 1-2 shators. They can summon only once per day.</p><p>The shator gehreleth is immune to all nonmagical attacks (fire, acid, cold, etc.) and to mind-affecting and illusion spells. No magical weapon of less than +3 enchantment affects them. All edged weapons have -1 penalties to hit and damage a shator. They have 120' infravision.</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Habitat/Society:</b> Few societies on the Lower Planes are stranger than that of the gehreleths. These enigmatic fiends fight without mercy against intruders, but have never been known to attack one another. Explanations for this puzzle range from instinct to intra-species empathy; no explanation yet advanced answers all the facts.</p><p>The gehreleths are the &ldquo;summoning stock&rdquo; of the Lower Planes. A wizard or priest who summons a lower-planar creature often gets a gehreleth - unfortunately. Gehreleths are dangerous to summoners because they avenge deeds they are forced to perform, often plotting revenge for many years. They never forget. Gehreleths, particularly the farastu, may even disobey a summoner, regardless of the importance of the mission. They are stubborn and hate servitude.</p><p>Despite their chaotic nature, the gehreleths pragmatically observe a class system based on raw power. The farastu are the lower class and sometimes servants. Kelubar form the middle class, shators the upper class and commanders.</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Ecology:</b> Gehreleths are spawned from the decaying bodies of beings that have traveled to the Lower Planes and died there. Some unidentified evil power gives them life and motivates them to destroy. They produce nothing of value and serve no purpose to anything around them.</p><p>Freshly transformed cadavers always become farastu. If a greater gehreleth is destroyed, an existing lesser rises in status and take its place; the lesser farastu ranks are replenished from new corpses.</p><p>Normally there are 3,333 of each variety of gehreleth. When the Blood War on the Lower Planes rages its strongest, the gehreleths increase their numbers to twice normal. Because they never take part in the war and are independent of the <a href=\"/appendix/baatezu\">baatezu</a> and <a href=\"/appendix/tanarri\">tanar'ri</a>, presumably this population increase protects them from both sides.</p><p></p><br clear=\"all\" style=\"clear:both; height:0;\">\r\n","images":["<img src=\"grf/ps.gif\" width=\"150\" height=\"75\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Planescape\" title=\"Planescape\" align=\"right\">","<img src=\"img/gehrelet.gif\" alt=\"Gehreleth\" title=\"Gehreleth\" border=\"0\" width=\"300\" height=\"360\" style=\"text-align:right;\" align=\"right\">","<img src=\"/img/spc/gehrfara.gif\" width=\"300\" height=\"360\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Farastu\" t=\"Farastu\" style=\"float:right;\">","<img src=\"/img/spc/gehrkelu.gif\" width=\"300\" height=\"360\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Kelubar\" t=\"Kelubar\" style=\"float:left;\">","<img src=\"/img/spc/gehrshat.gif\" width=\"300\" height=\"360\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Shator\" t=\"Shator\" style=\"float:right;\">","<img src=\"grf/add2_01.gif\" width=\"200\" height=\"56\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Advanced Dungeons & Dragons 2nd Edition\">"],"setting":"Planescape","statblock":{"Farastu":{"Activity Cycle":"Any","Alignment":"Chaotic evil","Armor Class":"-1","Climate/Terrain":"Carceri","Damage/Attack":"1d6+1/1dG+1/3d4 or weapon +7 (Strength bonus)","Diet":"Carnivore","Frequency":"Very rare","Hit Dice":"11","Intelligence":"Average (8-10)","Magic Resistance":"50%","Morale":"Champion (15-16)","Movement":"15, Fl 30 (C)","No. Appearing":"1","No. of Attacks":"3","Organization":"Solitary","Size":"M (7' tall)","Special Attacks":"Battle frenzy, adhesive","Special Defenses":"Adhesive, +1 or better weapons to hit","THAC0":"9","Treasure":"Nil","XP Value":"14,000"},"Kelubar":{"Activity Cycle":"Any","Alignment":"Chaotic evil","Armor Class":"-2","Climate/Terrain":"Carceri","Damage/Attack":"2d4/2d4/4d4 or weapon +9 (Strength bonus)","Diet":"Carnivore","Frequency":"Very rare","Hit Dice":"13","Intelligence":"Very (11-12)","Magic Resistance":"50%","Morale":"Champion (15-16)","Movement":"12, Fl 24 (C)","No. Appearing":"1","No. of Attacks":"3","Organization":"Solitary","Size":"M (6½'tall)","Special Attacks":"Stench, acidic slime","Special Defenses":"+2 or better weapons to hit","THAC0":"7","Treasure":"Nil","XP Value":"17,000"},"Shator":{"Activity Cycle":"Any","Alignment":"Chaotic evil","Armor Class":"-3","Climate/Terrain":"Carceri","Damage/Attack":"1d6+1/1d6+1/3d4 or weapon +9 (Strength bonus)","Diet":"Carnivore","Frequency":"Very rare","Hit Dice":"15","Intelligence":"Genius (17-18)","Magic Resistance":"50%","Morale":"Fanatic (17-18)","Movement":"9, Fl 18 (C)","No. Appearing":"1","No. of Attacks":"3","Organization":"Solitary","Size":"M (6' tall)","Special Attacks":"Magical weapons","Special Defenses":"Immune to nonmagical attacks, +3 or better weapons to hit, +2 to surprise rolls","THAC0":"5","Treasure":"Nil","XP Value":"22,000"}},"title":"Gehreleth"},"sources":["2118","2602"],"statblock_names":[],"title":"Gehreleth","prev_key":"geckonid","next_key":"geist","monster_path":"/appendix/gehrelet"}},"staticQueryHashes":[],"slicesMap":{}}
