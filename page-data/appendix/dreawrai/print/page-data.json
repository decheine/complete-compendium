While the powers listed above are the most common, some aarakocra have different or additional powers.</p><p class=\"f\">A race of intelligent, birdlike creatures living in the deepest deserts of Athas, the rare Athasian <a href=\"/appendix/aarakocr\">aarakocra</a> spends its time soaring on thermals in search of food.</p><p>The aarakocra is 7 to 8 feet tall with a wingspan of 20 feet or more. Because of its large wingspan, an aarakocra can carry as much as 75% of its own body weight and still fly easily. An aarakocra can fly a short distance carrying a burden equaling 125% of its own body weight. The average body weight of a full grown male is 100 pounds and a female is 85 pounds.</p><p>Each wing has a &ldquo;hand&rdquo; at its midpoint, consisting of three fingers and an opposable thumb. The fourth finger forms the rigid leading edge of the wing. In flight the hands cannot be used, but on the ground the aarakocra can use its hands almost as a human would. The aarakocra's body is protected by a thin bony plate on the chest, much like a solid rib cage. Talons on its legs can be used as claws and can be retracted to reveal a second set of hands, also with three fingers and an opposable thumb. Except for the chest plate, the entire skeleton is hollow and extremely fragile.</p><p>From a distance, the Athasian aarakocra resembles a huge <a href=\"/appendix/bird\">vulture</a>. Its black eyes, set in the front of the head, provide excellent vision over a long range. The plumage is generally black with a white collar for adult males and black or brown with a smaller white collar for females. Adolescents are a mixture of brown and black. The beak is large and covers most of the head. Plumage begins at the crown of the head and is darker near the head, except for the collar. Athasian aarakocra speak their own language and the languages of vultures and other large birds. Some speak the common tongue (5% to 10% chance depending on how deep in the wastelands a tribe lives).</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Combat:</b> Aarakocra can fight in the air or on the ground. They prefer aerial combat since their bones are too fragile to withstand a solid blow from a human-sized opponent. In combat against creatures on the ground, they prefer to fly over their victim and drop weighted nets. Some aarakocra use darts to harass ground-based opponents.</p><p>If their opponents can fly, the aarakocra generally forgo the use of the net, although large groups sometimes use nets on flying creatures. Normally, aarakocra attack flying creatures with long spears, diving from above and allowing the momentum to carry the spear through the target. Such an attack doubles the damage if the aarakocra have been able to dive at least 50 feet. Only the very largest aarakocra can carry more than one of these spears, they can attack with both at once with no penalty, causing double damage on each strike. All diving attacks are made at +4 and should be treated as a charge attack. All other penalties and restrictions of charge attacks apply.</p><p>The effect of the aarakocra's nets depends on if the opponent is flying at the time it becomes entangled. Creatures on the ground that are hit by a net are entangled and unable to participate in any combat until they make a successful Strength check to get free of the net. Flying creatures hit by a net can no longer fly and immediately begin falling. If they cannot escape the net or use some magical means to arrest the fall, normal falling damage applies.</p><p>Unless victims are entangled in nets, aarakocra are cautious in ground combat. If the aarakocra outnumber their opponents they advance in a straight line and thrust with their spears. If outnumbered, or the opponents are particularly tough, the aarakocra withdraw. Victims entangled in nets are killed or incapacitated for use as food or ransom.</p><p>Athasian aarakocra are mindful of their physical limitations as well as their comparatively low psionic abilities. They do not normally initiate psionic combat. At the first sign of psionic powers from any of their victims, however, all aarakocra that have some ability will use whatever attack and defense modes they can in an attempt to destroy the threat. Large groups of is or more aarakocra may initiate psionic combat if their leaders feel they can win quickly and avoid physical combat.</p><p>In desperation, an aarakocra can attempt to bite an opponent in combat. Because of the unwieldiness of its beak, the aarakocra has a THAC0 of 18 if attacking with this appendage. Further, the birdman causes only 1d2 points of damage with the beak.</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Habitat/Society:</b> Athasian aarakocra live in tribes with 6-20 (2d8+4) members, depending on the prestige of the leader. The largest tribe ever recorded had 50 members. The tribal hunting territory depends on the size of the tribe, usually about 500 square miles for a tribe of 10 members. There are no rigid boundaries between tribes and border disputes are not uncommon.</p><p>Alignments of tribe members are similar to the alignment of the leader. A tribe that has a leader who is neutral good may have neutral good, chaotic good, lawful good, and true neutral members. A predominantly evil tribe does not recognize boundaries with other tribes and treats other tribes as inferior beings to be eliminated.</p><p>Athasian aarakocra aren't happy in enclosed spaces, but they they take refuge in a cave or building if necessary.</p><p>Nonevil tribes live in rocky aeries in the highest peaks they can find. Evil tribes are normally nomadic and use an aerie made by another tribe if they need to remain in an area for a long time, even if they have to evict the tribe that made the nest.</p><p>Aarakocra aren't friendly toward intruders in their territory, especially caravans. They try to extract a toll from the caravan for passage through the desert. Good-aligned tribes allow unhindered passage of caravans that pay a tribute. If someone refuses to pay the tribute, the aarakocra try to capture scouts or outriders from the party and hold them until an even larger tribute is paid. The payment may be either livestock or shiny objects. Aarakocra are smart enough not to be taken in by glass baubles instead of gems, although they cannot tell the difference between the more common gems and the rare ones.</p><p>Evil tribes ask for tribute and often attack a caravan whether it pays or not. Aarakocra always demand shiny objects such as stones. These tribes find humans and demihumans to be quite tasty and prefer them to other food.</p><p>Good-aligned tribes of aarakocra sometimes return a lost traveler to the edge of the desert after first removing any valuables the traveler may be carrying. On very rare occasions a tribe might return a lost group of travelers to the more frequently traveled parts of the desert, again after first taking any valuables as payment.</p><p>The oldest male is the leader of the tribal hunting party and has 4+4 Hit Dice. The oldest female is in charge of the tribal aerie and has 3+3 HD. In tribes that have more than 15 members, the next oldest aarakocra serves as shaman and has 3+3 HD; the shaman completes the triumvirate necessary for proper worship and the summoning of elementals. (Interestingly, no magic-using aarakocra has ever been recorded.) Tribes without a shaman cannot summon <a href=\"/appendix/element1\">air elementals</a>, which is an important part of aarakocra culture.</p><p>The shaman is the leader of the daily sun worship. Aarakocra worship the sun because it provides them with the thermals they need to soar in search of food. The shaman also leads the mystic rituals used to summon an air elemental. Summoning an air elemental is usually done only in preparation for the tribe's most sacred ceremony, the hunt. Small tribes must band together for this ceremony to allow the triumvirate to be formed.</p><p>The ceremony to summon an air elemental must be conducted at dawn and requires the oldest male and female to emit a highpitched keening whistle. The shaman conducts an intricate dance around them, simultaneously chanting an ancient summoning mantra.</p><p>The hunt is the final part of the initiation of adolescent aarakocra to adulthood and often takes the tribe far from their normal teritory. The target is always a <a href=\"/appendix/drakalsi\">silt drake</a>. The hunt is the only time the females leave the relative safety of the nest. Even an evil tribe will not interfere with a tribe on a hunt. An air elemental is often summoned to help find the drake, but never takes part in the actual combat. Although the adult members of the tribe take part in the initial phases of the combat, it is the initiates who deliver the final, killing blows to me drake. Scars from the hunt are considered a mark of pride among all aarakocra.</p><p>The females spend about eight months of the year incubating their eggs. Athasian aarakocra mate for life and a pair normally produces as many as 10 offspring. A female lays one egg a year. Constant incubation is not required because of the high daytime temperatures, so the females can maintain the nest and keep the tribe's treasure in order.</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Ecology:</b> Athasian aarakocra are high on the food chain and have no natural enemies other than <a href=\"/appendix/drakatha\">drakes</a>. Unless evil, aarakocra leave their own territory only to hunt the silt drake and return as soon as possible when the hunt is over. (Evil aarakocra attack others, as noted above.) Aarakocra eggs and hatchlings are sought after by wealthy land owners who wish to use the creatures as scouts and sentries. An egg can bring as much as 10 cp in Tyr's marketplace. Tribes that have had eggs or hatchlings stolen have long memories and sometimes take revenge against the thief at a later date. Captive aarakocra join any tribe they come in contact with.</p><p>Athasian aarakocra have a natural life span of 21-30 years.</p><p></p><br clear=\"all\" style=\"clear:both; height:0;\">\r\n","images":["<img src=\"grf/ds.gif\" width=\"150\" height=\"75\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Dark Sun\" title=\"Dark Sun\" align=\"right\">","<img src=\"img/aarakath.gif\" alt=\"Aarakocra (Athas)\" title=\"Aarakocra (Athas)\" border=\"0\" width=\"300\" height=\"360\" style=\"text-align:right;\" align=\"right\">","<img src=\"grf/add2_01.gif\" width=\"200\" height=\"56\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Advanced Dungeons & Dragons 2nd Edition\">"],"setting":"Dark Sun","statblock":{"Aarakocra (Athas)":{"Activity Cycle":"Day","Alignment":"Any","Armor Class":"7","Climate/Terrain":"Deep desert","Damage/Attack":"1d3/1d3 or by weapon","Diet":"Carnivore","Frequency":"Rare","Hit Dice":"2+2","Intelligence":"Average (8-10)","Magic Resistance":"Nil","Morale":"Steady (11)","Movement":"6, Fl 36 (C)","No. Appearing":"1d10","No. of Attacks":"2","Organization":"Tribal","Size":"M (20'+ wingspan)","Special Attacks":"Nil","Special Defenses":"Nil","THAC0":"17","Treasure":"Varies","XP Value":"65"}},"title":"Aarakocra (Athas)"},"sources":["2433"],"statblock_names":[],"title":"Aarakocra (Athas)","prev_key":"zygraat","next_key":"aarakocr","monster_path":"/appendix/aarakath"}}},"pageContext":{"monster_key":"dreawrai","monster_data":{"TSR":["2105"],"fullBody":"  <table cellspacing=\"0\" cellpadding=\"0\"><tr><th>Climate/Terrain:</th><td>As creature or person mimicked</td></tr><tr><th>Frequency:</th><td>Very rare</td></tr><tr><th>Organization:</th><td>As creature or person mimicked</td></tr><tr><th>Activity Cycle:</th><td>As creature or person mimicked</td></tr><tr><th>Diet:</th><td>None</td></tr><tr><th>Intelligence:</th><td>As creature or person mimicked</td></tr><tr><th>Treasure:</th><td>Nil</td></tr><tr><th>Alignment:</th><td>Chaotic evil</td></tr><tr><th>No. Appearing:</th><td>1-4</td></tr><tr><th>Armor Class:</th><td>3</td></tr><tr><th>Movement:</th><td>As creature or person mimicked</td></tr><tr><th>Hit Dice:</th><td>8</td></tr><tr><th>THAC0:</th><td>13</td></tr><tr><th>No. of Attacks:</th><td>1</td></tr><tr><th>Damage/Attack:</th><td>1-10 or by weapon (illusionary)</td></tr><tr><th>Special Attacks:</th><td>-1 bonus to initiative roll</td></tr><tr><th>Special Defenses:</th><td>Nil</td></tr><tr><th>Magic Resistance:</th><td>See below</td></tr><tr><th>Size:</th><td>As person or creature mimicked</td></tr><tr><th>Morale:</th><td>Elite (14)</td></tr><tr><th>XP Value:</th><td>2,000</td></tr></table><p class=\"f\">Dreamwraiths are violent creations of the subconscious. They assault the minds of their victims through powerful illusionary attacks.</p><p>A dreamwraith can appear in a number of forms, usually humanoid, but almost always frightening and repulsive. It often takes the form of the dead, decaying visage of a character's former friend or ally. Dreamwraiths are normally encountered as a result of a <i>mindspin</i> spell (see following).</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Combat:</b> Although their forms can vary, the AC and Hit Dice of dreamwraiths are always the same. Dreamwraiths despise all non-illusionary creatures of good or neutral alignment and are devoted to their destruction. Intelligent and cunning, dreamwraiths strike with surprising fury, often catching their victims off-guard. Dreamwraiths gain a -1 bonus to all initiative checks.</p><p>Occasionally, a character may encounter a dreamwraith with the ability to <i>cause despair</i>. Such a dreamwraith will tell the character a tale of hopelessness and discouragement. If the character succeeds in a saving throw vs. spell, he resists the hypnotic effect of the dreamwraith's words. If he fails the saving throw, the character is overwhelmed with despair. He joins the dreamwraith, repeating the litany of hopelessness. Only a <i>dispel magic</i> spell or a convincing speech about hope and courage can negate the despair. There is a base chance of 30% that the speech negates the despair. At the DM'S discretion, the base chance may be modified as much as +70% if the speech is particularly inspiring.</p><p>The chilling touch of a dreamwraith inflicts 1d10 points of damage. They also employ a variety of weapons, most often long swords, battle axes, and daggers. However, the damage from both the touch and the weapons is illusionary, equal to 1 hit point of real damage per 4 points of illusionary damage. As with the illusionary damage of a <a href=\"/appendix/dreashad\">dreamshadow</a>, a character suffering illusionary damage perceives the damage to be real, &ldquo;dying&rdquo; when he believes he has suffered a fatal amount of damage. The illusionary nature of the damage is apparent only after the dream has ended.</p><p>Dreamwraiths take normal damage from a character's weapons and spells, ceasing to exist when reduced to 0 hit points.</p><p>Dreamwraiths have normal magic resistance in the first level of <i>mindspin</i> dream, 10% magic resistance in the second level, and 20% in the third level. Because they are not undead, they cannot be turned.</p><p>If a dreamwraith is disbelieved before it conducts its first attack on a character, the character suffers no illusionary damage. A character cannot disbelieve a dreamwraith once he has suffered illusionary damage from it.</p><p class=\"ni\"><b>Disbelieving Illusions:</b> A character can attempt to disbelieve dreamwraiths and dreamshadows. Each disbelief attempt requires the following steps:</p><ol><li>The disbelieving character announces how many melee rounds he intends to concentrate on the suspected illusion.</li><li>The modifier for the disbelief check is determined, based on the length of uninterrupted concentration (see the table below). The character can perform no other actions while concentrating. Note that the concentration time is extremely limited if the illusion attacks the character while he is concentrating.</li><li>Determine the Disbelief Number by adding the concentration modifier to the characters intelligence. Add 1 for every other character who has successfully disbelieved during any previous round. If the character is attempting to disbelieve a dreamwraith, there is a -5 penalty.</li><li>The DM secretly rolls 1d20. It the result is higher than the Disbelief Number, then the entity in question looks real and its effects are perceived as real. It the result is equal to or lower than the Disbelief Number, then the illusion is disbelieved. A disbelief check can be made only once per hour by a character against any single illusion however, the character can check again whenever another character in his group makes a successful check. If an illusion is a group of entities, then the check is made for the entire group. Characters who successfully disbelieve cannot be harmed by illusions.</li></ol><p class=\"ni\"><b>Concentration Modifiers for Illusion Disbelief</b></p><table class=\"ip\"><tr class=\"bk\"><th>Time</th><th>Modifier</th></tr><tr><td>1 round</td><td>+1</td></tr><tr><td>2 rounds</td><td>+2</td></tr><tr><td>3 rounds</td><td>+3</td></tr><tr><td>4-6 rounds</td><td>+4</td></tr><tr><td>7-9 rounds</td><td>+5</td></tr><tr><td>1-3 turns</td><td>+6</td></tr><tr><td>4-6 turns</td><td>+7</td></tr><tr><td>1+ hours</td><td>+8</td></tr></table><p class=\"f\"><b>Habitat/Society:</b> A dreamwraith ceases to exist when the dream in which he resides has ended.</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Ecology:</b> Dreamwraiths experience only illusionary physiological functions.

The spell requires both the caster and the victim to remain undisturbed for three hours while the caster sifts through the victim's mind to create the illusions. Any disturbance negates the process. If the victim rolls a successful saving throw vs. spell, the spell is also broken (but a <i>charmed</i> victim is not entitled to a saving throw). For the purposes of dispelling, the <i>mindspin</i> spell is treated as if cast by a 21st-level wizard.</p><p>Those within the dream experience it as three separate levels of reality. Components of the dream are experienced as the victim or victims move over physical terrain. The terrain moves along at a rate of one mile per hour, with a maximum range that depends on the level of the dream and the Intelligence of the character on whom the spell was cast. The first level extends to a maximum of 20 miles times the character's Intelligence. The second level extends to a maximum of one mile times the character's Intelligence. The third level extends to a maximum of 20 feet times the character's Intelligence. The dreamer is always a central figure of the dream: all of the effects of each level of the dream disappear if the dreamer is awakened.</p><p>The first level of the dream alters a character's perceptions of space, time, and reality of the immediate area. He may perceive the terrain to be a lush forest when in reality it is a barren field. A character may actually travel many miles, yet only perceive himself as having moved a short distance. Time is equally distorted. He may believe he has been traveling for only a few minutes, when actually several days have passed. Dreamwraiths and dreamshadows are common in all levels of the dream; the character is constantly faced with determining what is reality and what is illusion.</p><p>The second level of the dream distorts a character's perception of reality even further, for he can no longer distinguish which of his companions are real and which are illusions.</p><p>The third level is the core of the dream, as a character's perceptions of himself become distorted. In addition to the etfects of the previous two levels, a character must use the attack and saving throw table of another class: Priests use rogue tables, Warriors use wizard tables, Wizards use warrior tables, and Rogues use priest tables.</p><p>Additionally, because of the disorienting effects of the dream area, certain classes make the following adjustments:</p><p><b>Priest:</b> Subtract Wisdom from 20.

Dragon orbs are etched crystal 20 inches in diameter when in use. When not in use, the orbs shrink to ten inches in diameter. They expand when the command words, carved into the surface of the orbs, are spoken.</p><p>Dragon orbs contain the essences of dragonkind, which serve as the source of the orbs' power. A wizard attempting to use an orb to summon evil <a href=\"/appendix/dragon\">dragons</a> its primary use, must gaze into it and speak the command words. If the character fails a saving throw vs spell, he is charmed by the essence of the orb and succcumbs to a <i>mindspin</i> spell with the effects described above (If the wizard succeeds in his saving throw any dragon within 1d4 x 10 miles is summoned to the orb and attacks any nonevil creatures it finds near the orb.)</p><p>Each orb can cast cure serious wounds three times per day, cast <i>continual light</i> at will, and cast detect magic at will.

If the saving throw is successful the check must be made to see it any evil dragons arrive. <i>Detect magic</i> and <i>detect evil</i> spells show a positive result if cast upon an orb or a character charmed by an orb.
