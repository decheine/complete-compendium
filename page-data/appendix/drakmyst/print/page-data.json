While the powers listed above are the most common, some aarakocra have different or additional powers.</p><p class=\"f\">A race of intelligent, birdlike creatures living in the deepest deserts of Athas, the rare Athasian <a href=\"/appendix/aarakocr\">aarakocra</a> spends its time soaring on thermals in search of food.</p><p>The aarakocra is 7 to 8 feet tall with a wingspan of 20 feet or more. Because of its large wingspan, an aarakocra can carry as much as 75% of its own body weight and still fly easily. An aarakocra can fly a short distance carrying a burden equaling 125% of its own body weight. The average body weight of a full grown male is 100 pounds and a female is 85 pounds.</p><p>Each wing has a &ldquo;hand&rdquo; at its midpoint, consisting of three fingers and an opposable thumb. The fourth finger forms the rigid leading edge of the wing. In flight the hands cannot be used, but on the ground the aarakocra can use its hands almost as a human would. The aarakocra's body is protected by a thin bony plate on the chest, much like a solid rib cage. Talons on its legs can be used as claws and can be retracted to reveal a second set of hands, also with three fingers and an opposable thumb. Except for the chest plate, the entire skeleton is hollow and extremely fragile.</p><p>From a distance, the Athasian aarakocra resembles a huge <a href=\"/appendix/bird\">vulture</a>. Its black eyes, set in the front of the head, provide excellent vision over a long range. The plumage is generally black with a white collar for adult males and black or brown with a smaller white collar for females. Adolescents are a mixture of brown and black. The beak is large and covers most of the head. Plumage begins at the crown of the head and is darker near the head, except for the collar. Athasian aarakocra speak their own language and the languages of vultures and other large birds. Some speak the common tongue (5% to 10% chance depending on how deep in the wastelands a tribe lives).</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Combat:</b> Aarakocra can fight in the air or on the ground. They prefer aerial combat since their bones are too fragile to withstand a solid blow from a human-sized opponent. In combat against creatures on the ground, they prefer to fly over their victim and drop weighted nets. Some aarakocra use darts to harass ground-based opponents.</p><p>If their opponents can fly, the aarakocra generally forgo the use of the net, although large groups sometimes use nets on flying creatures. Normally, aarakocra attack flying creatures with long spears, diving from above and allowing the momentum to carry the spear through the target. Such an attack doubles the damage if the aarakocra have been able to dive at least 50 feet. Only the very largest aarakocra can carry more than one of these spears, they can attack with both at once with no penalty, causing double damage on each strike. All diving attacks are made at +4 and should be treated as a charge attack. All other penalties and restrictions of charge attacks apply.</p><p>The effect of the aarakocra's nets depends on if the opponent is flying at the time it becomes entangled. Creatures on the ground that are hit by a net are entangled and unable to participate in any combat until they make a successful Strength check to get free of the net. Flying creatures hit by a net can no longer fly and immediately begin falling. If they cannot escape the net or use some magical means to arrest the fall, normal falling damage applies.</p><p>Unless victims are entangled in nets, aarakocra are cautious in ground combat. If the aarakocra outnumber their opponents they advance in a straight line and thrust with their spears. If outnumbered, or the opponents are particularly tough, the aarakocra withdraw. Victims entangled in nets are killed or incapacitated for use as food or ransom.</p><p>Athasian aarakocra are mindful of their physical limitations as well as their comparatively low psionic abilities. They do not normally initiate psionic combat. At the first sign of psionic powers from any of their victims, however, all aarakocra that have some ability will use whatever attack and defense modes they can in an attempt to destroy the threat. Large groups of is or more aarakocra may initiate psionic combat if their leaders feel they can win quickly and avoid physical combat.</p><p>In desperation, an aarakocra can attempt to bite an opponent in combat. Because of the unwieldiness of its beak, the aarakocra has a THAC0 of 18 if attacking with this appendage. Further, the birdman causes only 1d2 points of damage with the beak.</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Habitat/Society:</b> Athasian aarakocra live in tribes with 6-20 (2d8+4) members, depending on the prestige of the leader. The largest tribe ever recorded had 50 members. The tribal hunting territory depends on the size of the tribe, usually about 500 square miles for a tribe of 10 members. There are no rigid boundaries between tribes and border disputes are not uncommon.</p><p>Alignments of tribe members are similar to the alignment of the leader. A tribe that has a leader who is neutral good may have neutral good, chaotic good, lawful good, and true neutral members. A predominantly evil tribe does not recognize boundaries with other tribes and treats other tribes as inferior beings to be eliminated.</p><p>Athasian aarakocra aren't happy in enclosed spaces, but they they take refuge in a cave or building if necessary.</p><p>Nonevil tribes live in rocky aeries in the highest peaks they can find. Evil tribes are normally nomadic and use an aerie made by another tribe if they need to remain in an area for a long time, even if they have to evict the tribe that made the nest.</p><p>Aarakocra aren't friendly toward intruders in their territory, especially caravans. They try to extract a toll from the caravan for passage through the desert. Good-aligned tribes allow unhindered passage of caravans that pay a tribute. If someone refuses to pay the tribute, the aarakocra try to capture scouts or outriders from the party and hold them until an even larger tribute is paid. The payment may be either livestock or shiny objects. Aarakocra are smart enough not to be taken in by glass baubles instead of gems, although they cannot tell the difference between the more common gems and the rare ones.</p><p>Evil tribes ask for tribute and often attack a caravan whether it pays or not. Aarakocra always demand shiny objects such as stones. These tribes find humans and demihumans to be quite tasty and prefer them to other food.</p><p>Good-aligned tribes of aarakocra sometimes return a lost traveler to the edge of the desert after first removing any valuables the traveler may be carrying. On very rare occasions a tribe might return a lost group of travelers to the more frequently traveled parts of the desert, again after first taking any valuables as payment.</p><p>The oldest male is the leader of the tribal hunting party and has 4+4 Hit Dice. The oldest female is in charge of the tribal aerie and has 3+3 HD. In tribes that have more than 15 members, the next oldest aarakocra serves as shaman and has 3+3 HD; the shaman completes the triumvirate necessary for proper worship and the summoning of elementals. (Interestingly, no magic-using aarakocra has ever been recorded.) Tribes without a shaman cannot summon <a href=\"/appendix/element1\">air elementals</a>, which is an important part of aarakocra culture.</p><p>The shaman is the leader of the daily sun worship. Aarakocra worship the sun because it provides them with the thermals they need to soar in search of food. The shaman also leads the mystic rituals used to summon an air elemental. Summoning an air elemental is usually done only in preparation for the tribe's most sacred ceremony, the hunt. Small tribes must band together for this ceremony to allow the triumvirate to be formed.</p><p>The ceremony to summon an air elemental must be conducted at dawn and requires the oldest male and female to emit a highpitched keening whistle. The shaman conducts an intricate dance around them, simultaneously chanting an ancient summoning mantra.</p><p>The hunt is the final part of the initiation of adolescent aarakocra to adulthood and often takes the tribe far from their normal teritory. The target is always a <a href=\"/appendix/drakalsi\">silt drake</a>. The hunt is the only time the females leave the relative safety of the nest. Even an evil tribe will not interfere with a tribe on a hunt. An air elemental is often summoned to help find the drake, but never takes part in the actual combat. Although the adult members of the tribe take part in the initial phases of the combat, it is the initiates who deliver the final, killing blows to me drake. Scars from the hunt are considered a mark of pride among all aarakocra.</p><p>The females spend about eight months of the year incubating their eggs. Athasian aarakocra mate for life and a pair normally produces as many as 10 offspring. A female lays one egg a year. Constant incubation is not required because of the high daytime temperatures, so the females can maintain the nest and keep the tribe's treasure in order.</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Ecology:</b> Athasian aarakocra are high on the food chain and have no natural enemies other than <a href=\"/appendix/drakatha\">drakes</a>. Unless evil, aarakocra leave their own territory only to hunt the silt drake and return as soon as possible when the hunt is over. (Evil aarakocra attack others, as noted above.) Aarakocra eggs and hatchlings are sought after by wealthy land owners who wish to use the creatures as scouts and sentries. An egg can bring as much as 10 cp in Tyr's marketplace. Tribes that have had eggs or hatchlings stolen have long memories and sometimes take revenge against the thief at a later date. Captive aarakocra join any tribe they come in contact with.</p><p>Athasian aarakocra have a natural life span of 21-30 years.</p>\n","images":["<img src=\"grf/ds.gif\" width=\"150\" height=\"75\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Dark Sun\" title=\"Dark Sun\" align=\"right\">","<img src=\"img/aarakath.gif\" alt=\"Aarakocra (Athas)\" title=\"Aarakocra (Athas)\" border=\"0\" width=\"300\" height=\"360\" style=\"text-align:right;\" align=\"right\">","<img src=\"grf/add2_01.gif\" width=\"200\" height=\"56\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Advanced Dungeons & Dragons 2nd Edition\">"],"setting":"Dark Sun","statblock":{"Aarakocra (Athas)":{"Activity Cycle":"Day","Alignment":"Any","Armor Class":"7","Climate/Terrain":"Deep desert","Damage/Attack":"1d3/1d3 or by weapon","Diet":"Carnivore","Frequency":"Rare","Hit Dice":"2+2","Intelligence":"Average (8-10)","Magic Resistance":"Nil","Morale":"Steady (11)","Movement":"6, Fl 36 (C)","No. Appearing":"1d10","No. of Attacks":"2","Organization":"Tribal","Size":"M (20'+ wingspan)","Special Attacks":"Nil","Special Defenses":"Nil","THAC0":"17","Treasure":"Varies","XP Value":"65"}},"title":"Aarakocra (Athas)"},"sources":["2433"],"statblock_names":[],"title":"Aarakocra (Athas)","prev_key":"zygraat","next_key":"aarakocr","monster_path":"/appendix/aarakath"}}},"pageContext":{"monster_key":"drakmyst","monster_data":{"TSR":["2501"],"fullBody":"  <table cellspacing=\"0\" cellpadding=\"0\"><tr class=\"bk\"><th> </th><th class=\"cn\">Mandrake</th><th class=\"cn\">Wooddrake</th><th class=\"cn\">Colddrake</th><th class=\"cn\">Elemental Drake</th></tr><tr><th>Climate/Terrain:</th><td>Any</td><td>Any forest</td><td>Cold regions</td><td>Any (see below)</td></tr><tr><th>Frequency:</th><td>Rare</td><td>Rare</td><td>Rare</td><td>Very rare</td></tr><tr><th>Organization:</th><td>Cells</td><td>Cells</td><td>Cells</td><td>Cells</td></tr><tr><th>Activity Cycle:</th><td>Day</td><td>Day</td><td>Night</td><td>Any</td></tr><tr><th>Diet:</th><td>Omnivore</td><td>Omnivore</td><td>Omnivore</td><td>Omnivore</td></tr><tr><th>Intelligence:</th><td>High (13-14)</td><td>High (13-14)</td><td>High (13-14)</td><td>High (13-14)</td></tr><tr><th>Treasure:</th><td>R (E)</td><td>R (E)</td><td>R (E)</td><td>Nil</td></tr><tr><th>Alignment:</th><td>Any chaotic</td><td>Any chaotic</td><td>Any chaotic</td><td>Neutral</td></tr><tr><th>No. Appearing:</th><td>1d4</td><td>1d4</td><td>1d4</td><td>1d4</td></tr><tr><th>Armor Class:</th><td>0</td><td>0</td><td>0</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><th>Movement:</th><td>12, Fl 3 (D)</td><td>12, Fl 3 (D)</td><td>12, Fl 3 (D)</td><td>12, Fl 3 (D)</td></tr><tr><th>Hit Dice:</th><td>3</td><td>4</td><td>5</td><td>6</td></tr><tr><th>THAC0:</th><td>17</td><td>17</td><td>15</td><td>15</td></tr><tr><th>No. of Attacks:</th><td>3</td><td>3</td><td>3</td><td>3</td></tr><tr><th>Damage/Attack:</th><td>1d2/1d2/1d6</td><td>1d2/1d2/1d8</td><td>1d2/1d2/2d4</td><td>1d3/1d3/1d8+2</td></tr><tr><th>Special Attacks:</th><td>Nil</td><td>Nil</td><td>Nil</td><td>Nil</td></tr><tr><th>Special Defenses:</th><td>Spell immunities</td><td>Spell immunities</td><td>Spell immunities</td><td>Spell immunities</td></tr><tr><th>Magic Resistance:</th><td>Nil</td><td>Nil</td><td>Nil</td><td>Nil</td></tr><tr><th>Size:</th><td>M (6' long)</td><td>M (3-5' long)</td><td>S (3-4' long)</td><td>L (8' long)</td></tr><tr><th>Morale:</th><td>Steady (12)</td><td>Steady (12)</td><td>Steady (12)</td><td>Elite (14)</td></tr><tr><th>XP Value:</th><td>270</td><td>420</td><td>650</td><td>975</td></tr></table><p class=\"f\">The drakes of Mystara are divided into two groups: chaotic and elemental. How closely related these groups are is a matter of disagreement among sages. In both cases, however, the drake is a man-sized creature.</p><p>In its true form, a drake resembles a small dragon with tiny wings and without front legs. The wings can support only slow flight for up to an hour at a time. However, drakes are most often encountered in a human or demihuman form; each of the four varieties can assume the form of one or two particular races (see details below). All drakes can use this <i>polymorph</i> power as often they desire, changing back and forth from draconian to nondraconian guise.</p><p>Drakes have no breath weapons or spellcasting abilities, but they can speak the language(s) befitting their <i>polymorphed</i> guise. They may be evil or good (50% chance of each) but, except for elemental drakes, are always chaotic.</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Combat:</b> Drakes are extremely intelligent and clever; they tell lies as needed, and surrender rather than fight to the death.</p><p>In human or demihuman form, a drake can use any weapon permitted to thieves. The attack and damage information given above applies to dragon-kin form only.</p><p>All drakes are immune to spells of 4th level or less. They can cancel this immunity for one round by concentrating - to receive a <i>cure wounds</i> spell, for example. They make saving throws as wizards of a level equal to their Hit Dice.</p><p>A <i>protecrion from evil</i> (or <i>good</i>, as appropriate) spell holds drakes at bay.</p><p>All drakes are thieves, having all the class abilities of a 5th-level thief (PP 50%, OL 42%, F/RT 40%, MS 40%, HS 31%, HN 20%, CW 90%, RL 25%; backstab &times;3). This can be a weakness as well as a virtue. For many drakes, theft is an obsession, like the disorder of kleptomania among humans. (The difficulty of a theft, not the value of the goods stolen, is what interests a drake. Thus, nearly worthless trinkets kept under lock, key, and burly guard would be far more desirable to a drake than a jewel-encrusted golden crown lying beside a road.)</p><p>Given their thief abihaes, it is natural that drakes prefer to attack by stealth whenever possible, and to take their enermes by surpnse and from a posiaon of advantage.</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Habitat/Society:</b> The drakes have long been considered a branch of the draconian family, which includes <a href=\"/appendix/dragmyst\">dragons</a> and <a href=\"/appendix/wyvern\">wyverns</a>, because the drakes' true form closely resembles a dragon. Their shapechanging ability is simdar to that of Mystara's <a href=\"/appendix/dragmgol\">gold dragons</a> as well. However, a hsiao scholar has demonstrated convincingly that the mandrakes, wooddrakes, and colddrakes are in fact related to Mystara's puckish fairykind.</p><p>Long ago, drakes devoted themselves to the cause of chaos. Their aim was to keep the world unstable - just unstable enough so it wouldn't progress to the point at which it could destroy itself. These drakes recalled a time when human technology almost destroyed Mystara, and they did not wish to see such events repeated.</p><p>The ideology of chaos is no longer such a conscious concern of drakes, rather, it has become an integral part of their nature, attitudes, and tendencies.</p><p>Chaotic evil drakes act in any way they wish and see no need to justify their behavior to anyone. These drakes revel in the company of other chaotic evil beings, and enjoy corrupting people into selfishness and wanton destruction. Chaotic neutral drakes have the same disregard for the opimons of others, but they are not actively malicious.</p><p>Chaotic good drakes, however, still seek a good end through chaos, and are not simply self-serving. They may take it upon themselves to pursue good chaos through adventuring; they seek out places where corrupt order has taken a firm hold (lawful evil philosophy is their nemesis), and try to overthrow it. They believe that all order is inherently corrupt, and only in anarchy can nature properly assert itself. The task of destroying all order is simply too vast, however. Therefore, they reason, it is best to concentrate on tyranny and the like - places where law has obviously gone bad. In fighting evil law, good drakes may be temporary allies with lawful good or even lawful neutral beings.</p><p>Drakes are found singly or in small groups, usually among humanoids who are unaware of their true nature. These &ldquo;cells&rdquo; of drakes have contact with other cells, creating a network of contacts that may span continents. These contacts are very useful for travel, to establish a new identity if a drake's true nature is uncovered, and for less respectable ends such as fencing stolen goods. (Some chaotic evil drakes use their contacts to help human thieves unload &ldquo;hot&rdquo; goods to distant huyen - for a generous cut in the profits, naturally.)</p><p>Both alignments of chaotic drakes are very fond of pranks and tricks, and have an acute sense of humor.</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Ecology:</b> To promote their chaotic goals, the drakes infiltrated the societies of men, elves, dwarves, halflings, and gnomes. There they subtly promoted their philosophy of chaos, nudging their neighbors into strife and disarray.</p><p>Drakes are omnivores. They eat balanced diets much like those of humans and demihumans. They do enjoy raw meat much more than most humans do, however.</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Mandrake</b></p>  <p class=\"ni\">These tan drakes can change into human form, and they enjoy the company of men. They often hold minor jobs in stables and taverns in towns (never in positions of importance or power), and may pretend to be adventurers. They steal food from town storehouses, and valuables from wandering townsfolk.</p><p>Some mandrakes may actually join thieves' guilds and improve their abilities, though most avoid such lawfulness.</p><p></p><p class=\"f\"><b>Wooddrake</b></p>  <p class=\"ni\">In their true form, wooddrakes are dark green. They also can assume elf and halfling forms. Otherwise, they're very similar in habits to mandrakes, and are sometimes discovered amidst elven or halfling communities.</p><p></p><p class=\"f\"><b>Colddrake</b></p>  <p class=\"ni\">These white drakes shun the light of day, living deep underground (usually in icy caverns). They can change themselves into dwarf and gnome forms, and can sometimes be found amidst an underground dwarf or gnome community.</p><p></p><h2>Elemental Drake</h2><p class=\"f\">Elemental drakes include four species (one for each element). They are distant cousins of the drakes described above, which are more common. Airdrakes are blue, earthdrakes are brown, flamedrakes are red, and water drakes are sea green. (Note: The Monstrous Manual describes a dragonet called the &ldquo;<a href=\"/appendix/drnefidr\">fire drake</a>&rdquo;. This creature is entirely different from the Mystaran flamedrake.)</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Combat:</b> Elemental drakes are immune to normal and silver weapons; a magical weapon is needed to damage them.</p><p>On the Prime Material Plane, elemental drakes can take the forms of young giants (1 to 4 feet shorter than normal), but they cannot throw rocks in those forms, and can only inflict 2d6 points of damage in hand-to-hand combat (instead of the normal damage done by the giant form). An airdrake can assume the form of a <a href=\"/appendix/gianclou\">cloud giant</a>; an earthdrake, a <a href=\"/appendix/gianston\">stone giant</a>; a flamedrake, a <a href=\"/appendix/gianfire\">fire giant</a>; and a waterdrake, a <a href=\"/appendix/gianstor\">storm giant</a>.</p><p>Elemental drakes share the ahdities, immunities, and vulnerabilities of the more common drakes described above: thieves' skills, spell immunities, and the hedging effects of a <i>protection from evil or good</i> spell.</p><p>On their home planes, elemental drakes cannot change into giant forms; instead, they assume the form if a small elemental, with all the abilities of that form (treat them as a 6 Hit Dice elemental in size and ability).</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Habitat/Society:</b> These creatures live on the elemental planes, and are very rare on the Prime Material Plane. They cannot normally travel between the planes, but may &ldquo;ride&rdquo; along with an elemental or other creature, either to or from their plane of origin. On the Prime Material Plane, elemental drakes are sometimes found amid the real giants whose form they can take, acting for their own pulposes. The nature of these purposes is elusive. For the most part, elemental drakes seem content simply to observe what goes on. Perhapse they are spies and informants for the elemental planes' rulers, keeping those suzerains well informed about what goes on amongst giantkind.</p><p>Like the chaotic drakes, the elemental drakes arrange themselves in &ldquo;cells&rdquo; of individuals who can assist each other, while maintaining their &ldquo;cover&rdquo; in humanoid society.</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Ecology:</b> Elemental drakes are omnivores. Like other drakes, their diet closely matches that of the humanoids they can resemble. In addition, these drakes are nourished by frequent contact with their native element. Given the giants whose shapes they take, arranging such contact is no difficulty nor is it something that would attract attention.</p><p>An elemental drake deprived of contact with its native element will, over the course of days, become weakened (not to mention irritable). Of course, this differs little from the effects of food and water deprivation on humans.</p><p>The origin of the elemental drakes is hotly debated among sages. One camp believes the drakes are all descended from a minor subspecies of dragon that adapted to life on the Elemental planes. The other side holds that the drake-shape is a coincidental shape evolved by elemental life. Just to confuse things, some rogue thinkers assert that elemental drakes may be the result of magical crossbreeding of elementals and dragons.</p>\n","images":["<img src=\"grf/ms.gif\" width=\"150\" height=\"75\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Mystara\" title=\"Mystara\" align=\"right\">","<img src=\"img/drakmyst.gif\" alt=\"Drake (Mystara)\" title=\"Drake (Mystara)\" border=\"0\" width=\"300\" height=\"360\" style=\"text-align:right;\" align=\"right\">","<img src=\"grf/add2_01.gif\" width=\"200\" height=\"56\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Advanced Dungeons & Dragons 2nd Edition\">"],"setting":"Mystara","statblock":{"Colddrake":{"Activity Cycle":"Night","Alignment":"Any chaotic","Armor Class":"0","Climate/Terrain":"Cold regions","Damage/Attack":"1d2/1d2/2d4","Diet":"Omnivore","Frequency":"Rare","Hit Dice":"5","Intelligence":"High (13-14)","Magic Resistance":"Nil","Morale":"Steady (12)","Movement":"12, Fl 3 (D)","No. Appearing":"1d4","No. of Attacks":"3","Organization":"Cells","Size":"S (3-4' long)","Special Attacks":"Nil","Special Defenses":"Spell immunities","THAC0":"15","Treasure":"R (E)","XP Value":"650"},"Elemental Drake":{"Activity Cycle":"Any","Alignment":"Neutral","Armor Class":"0","Climate/Terrain":"Any (see below)","Damage/Attack":"1d3/1d3/1d8+2","Diet":"Omnivore","Frequency":"Very rare","Hit Dice":"6","Intelligence":"High (13-14)","Magic Resistance":"Nil","Morale":"Elite (14)","Movement":"12, Fl 3 (D)","No. Appearing":"1d4","No. of Attacks":"3","Organization":"Cells","Size":"L (8' long)","Special Attacks":"Nil","Special Defenses":"Spell immunities","THAC0":"15","Treasure":"Nil","XP Value":"975"},"Mandrake":{"Activity Cycle":"Day","Alignment":"Any chaotic","Armor Class":"0","Climate/Terrain":"Any","Damage/Attack":"1d2/1d2/1d6","Diet":"Omnivore","Frequency":"Rare","Hit Dice":"3","Intelligence":"High (13-14)","Magic Resistance":"Nil","Morale":"Steady (12)","Movement":"12, Fl 3 (D)","No. Appearing":"1d4","No. of Attacks":"3","Organization":"Cells","Size":"M (6' long)","Special Attacks":"Nil","Special Defenses":"Spell immunities","THAC0":"17","Treasure":"R (E)","XP Value":"270"},"Wooddrake":{"Activity Cycle":"Day","Alignment":"Any chaotic","Armor Class":"0","Climate/Terrain":"Any forest","Damage/Attack":"1d2/1d2/1d8","Diet":"Omnivore","Frequency":"Rare","Hit Dice":"4","Intelligence":"High (13-14)","Magic Resistance":"Nil","Morale":"Steady (12)","Movement":"12, Fl 3 (D)","No. Appearing":"1d4","No. of Attacks":"3","Organization":"Cells","Size":"M (3-5' long)","Special Attacks":"Nil","Special Defenses":"Spell immunities","THAC0":"17","Treasure":"R (E)","XP Value":"420"}},"title":"Drake (Mystara)"},"sources":["2501"],"statblock_names":[],"title":"Drake (Mystara)","prev_key":"drakawat","next_key":"draknor","monster_path":"/appendix/drakmyst"}},"staticQueryHashes":[],"slicesMap":{}}
