They will cheerfully assist good creatures if their need is genuine. They often take the forms of kindly old men or fair damsels when associating with people.</p><p>At birth, a silver dragon's scales are blue-gray with silver highlights. As the dragon approaches adulthood, its color slowly lightens to brightly gleaming silver. An <i>adult</i> or older silver dragon has scales so fine that the individual scales are scarcely visible. From a distance, these dragons look as if they have been sculpted from pure metal.</p><p>Silver dragons speak their own tongue, a tongue common to all good dragons, and 16% of hatchling silver dragons have an ability to communicate with any intelligent creature. The chance to possess this ability increases 5% per age category of the dragon.</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Combat:</b> Silver dragons are not violent and avoid combat except when faced with highly evil or aggressive foes. If necessary, they use <i>feather fall</i> to stop any missiles fired at them. They use <i>wall of fog</i> or <i>control weather</i> to blind or confuse opponents before making melee attacks. If angry, they will use <i>reverse gravity</i> to fling enemies helplessly into the air, where they can be snatched. When faced with flying opponents, a silver dragon will hide in clouds (often creating some with <i>control weather</i> on clear days), remain there using <i>cloud walking</i>, then jump to the attack when they have the advantage.</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Breath Weapon/Special Abilities:</b> A silver dragon has two breath weapons: a cone of cold 80' long, 5' wide at the dragon's mouth, and 30' wide at the end or a cloud of paralyzation gas 50' long, 40' wide, and 20' high. Creatures caught in the cold are allowed a save versus breath weapon for half damage. A silver dragon casts its spells and uses its magical abilities at 6th level, plus its combat modifier.</p><p>At birth, silver dragons are immune to cold and can <i>polymorph self </i>three times a day. Each change in form lasts until the dragon chooses a different form and reverting to their normal form does not count as a change. They also can <i>cloud walk</i>. This allows the dragon to tread on clouds or fog as though they were solid ground. The ability functions continuously, but can be negated or resumed at will. As they age, they gain the following additional powers:</p><p><i>Young: feather fall</i> twice a day. <i>Juvenile: wall of fog</i> once a day. <i>Adult: control winds</i> three times a day. <i>Mature adult: control weather</i> once a day. <i>Old: reverse gravity</i> once a day.</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Habitat/Society:</b> Silver dragons prefer aerial lairs on secluded mountain peaks, or amid the clouds themselves. When they lair in clouds there always will be an enchanted area with a sold floor for laying eggs and storing treasure.</p><p>Silver dragons seem to prefer human form to their own, and often have mortal companions. Frequently they share deep friendships with mortals. Inevitably, however, the dragon reveals its true form and takes its leave to live a dragon's life for a time.</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Ecology:</b> Silver dragons prefer human food, and can live on such fare indefinitely.</p><p>Because they lair in similar territories, silver dragons come into conflict with <a href=\"/appendix/dragcred\">red dragons</a>. Duels between the two species are furious and deadly, but silver dragons generally get the upper hand since they are more capable of working together against their foes and often have human allies.</p><br><table><tr class=\"cn\"><th>Age</th><th>Body Lgt.
