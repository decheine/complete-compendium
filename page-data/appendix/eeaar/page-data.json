While the powers listed above are the most common, some aarakocra have different or additional powers.</p><p class=\"f\">A race of intelligent, birdlike creatures living in the deepest deserts of Athas, the rare Athasian <a href=\"/appendix/aarakocr\">aarakocra</a> spends its time soaring on thermals in search of food.</p><p>The aarakocra is 7 to 8 feet tall with a wingspan of 20 feet or more. Because of its large wingspan, an aarakocra can carry as much as 75% of its own body weight and still fly easily. An aarakocra can fly a short distance carrying a burden equaling 125% of its own body weight. The average body weight of a full grown male is 100 pounds and a female is 85 pounds.</p><p>Each wing has a &ldquo;hand&rdquo; at its midpoint, consisting of three fingers and an opposable thumb. The fourth finger forms the rigid leading edge of the wing. In flight the hands cannot be used, but on the ground the aarakocra can use its hands almost as a human would. The aarakocra's body is protected by a thin bony plate on the chest, much like a solid rib cage. Talons on its legs can be used as claws and can be retracted to reveal a second set of hands, also with three fingers and an opposable thumb. Except for the chest plate, the entire skeleton is hollow and extremely fragile.</p><p>From a distance, the Athasian aarakocra resembles a huge <a href=\"/appendix/bird\">vulture</a>. Its black eyes, set in the front of the head, provide excellent vision over a long range. The plumage is generally black with a white collar for adult males and black or brown with a smaller white collar for females. Adolescents are a mixture of brown and black. The beak is large and covers most of the head. Plumage begins at the crown of the head and is darker near the head, except for the collar. Athasian aarakocra speak their own language and the languages of vultures and other large birds. Some speak the common tongue (5% to 10% chance depending on how deep in the wastelands a tribe lives).</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Combat:</b> Aarakocra can fight in the air or on the ground. They prefer aerial combat since their bones are too fragile to withstand a solid blow from a human-sized opponent. In combat against creatures on the ground, they prefer to fly over their victim and drop weighted nets. Some aarakocra use darts to harass ground-based opponents.</p><p>If their opponents can fly, the aarakocra generally forgo the use of the net, although large groups sometimes use nets on flying creatures. Normally, aarakocra attack flying creatures with long spears, diving from above and allowing the momentum to carry the spear through the target. Such an attack doubles the damage if the aarakocra have been able to dive at least 50 feet. Only the very largest aarakocra can carry more than one of these spears, they can attack with both at once with no penalty, causing double damage on each strike. All diving attacks are made at +4 and should be treated as a charge attack. All other penalties and restrictions of charge attacks apply.</p><p>The effect of the aarakocra's nets depends on if the opponent is flying at the time it becomes entangled. Creatures on the ground that are hit by a net are entangled and unable to participate in any combat until they make a successful Strength check to get free of the net. Flying creatures hit by a net can no longer fly and immediately begin falling. If they cannot escape the net or use some magical means to arrest the fall, normal falling damage applies.</p><p>Unless victims are entangled in nets, aarakocra are cautious in ground combat. If the aarakocra outnumber their opponents they advance in a straight line and thrust with their spears. If outnumbered, or the opponents are particularly tough, the aarakocra withdraw. Victims entangled in nets are killed or incapacitated for use as food or ransom.</p><p>Athasian aarakocra are mindful of their physical limitations as well as their comparatively low psionic abilities. They do not normally initiate psionic combat. At the first sign of psionic powers from any of their victims, however, all aarakocra that have some ability will use whatever attack and defense modes they can in an attempt to destroy the threat. Large groups of is or more aarakocra may initiate psionic combat if their leaders feel they can win quickly and avoid physical combat.</p><p>In desperation, an aarakocra can attempt to bite an opponent in combat. Because of the unwieldiness of its beak, the aarakocra has a THAC0 of 18 if attacking with this appendage. Further, the birdman causes only 1d2 points of damage with the beak.</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Habitat/Society:</b> Athasian aarakocra live in tribes with 6-20 (2d8+4) members, depending on the prestige of the leader. The largest tribe ever recorded had 50 members. The tribal hunting territory depends on the size of the tribe, usually about 500 square miles for a tribe of 10 members. There are no rigid boundaries between tribes and border disputes are not uncommon.</p><p>Alignments of tribe members are similar to the alignment of the leader. A tribe that has a leader who is neutral good may have neutral good, chaotic good, lawful good, and true neutral members. A predominantly evil tribe does not recognize boundaries with other tribes and treats other tribes as inferior beings to be eliminated.</p><p>Athasian aarakocra aren't happy in enclosed spaces, but they they take refuge in a cave or building if necessary.</p><p>Nonevil tribes live in rocky aeries in the highest peaks they can find. Evil tribes are normally nomadic and use an aerie made by another tribe if they need to remain in an area for a long time, even if they have to evict the tribe that made the nest.</p><p>Aarakocra aren't friendly toward intruders in their territory, especially caravans. They try to extract a toll from the caravan for passage through the desert. Good-aligned tribes allow unhindered passage of caravans that pay a tribute. If someone refuses to pay the tribute, the aarakocra try to capture scouts or outriders from the party and hold them until an even larger tribute is paid. The payment may be either livestock or shiny objects. Aarakocra are smart enough not to be taken in by glass baubles instead of gems, although they cannot tell the difference between the more common gems and the rare ones.</p><p>Evil tribes ask for tribute and often attack a caravan whether it pays or not. Aarakocra always demand shiny objects such as stones. These tribes find humans and demihumans to be quite tasty and prefer them to other food.</p><p>Good-aligned tribes of aarakocra sometimes return a lost traveler to the edge of the desert after first removing any valuables the traveler may be carrying. On very rare occasions a tribe might return a lost group of travelers to the more frequently traveled parts of the desert, again after first taking any valuables as payment.</p><p>The oldest male is the leader of the tribal hunting party and has 4+4 Hit Dice. The oldest female is in charge of the tribal aerie and has 3+3 HD. In tribes that have more than 15 members, the next oldest aarakocra serves as shaman and has 3+3 HD; the shaman completes the triumvirate necessary for proper worship and the summoning of elementals. (Interestingly, no magic-using aarakocra has ever been recorded.) Tribes without a shaman cannot summon <a href=\"/appendix/element1\">air elementals</a>, which is an important part of aarakocra culture.</p><p>The shaman is the leader of the daily sun worship. Aarakocra worship the sun because it provides them with the thermals they need to soar in search of food. The shaman also leads the mystic rituals used to summon an air elemental. Summoning an air elemental is usually done only in preparation for the tribe's most sacred ceremony, the hunt. Small tribes must band together for this ceremony to allow the triumvirate to be formed.</p><p>The ceremony to summon an air elemental must be conducted at dawn and requires the oldest male and female to emit a highpitched keening whistle. The shaman conducts an intricate dance around them, simultaneously chanting an ancient summoning mantra.</p><p>The hunt is the final part of the initiation of adolescent aarakocra to adulthood and often takes the tribe far from their normal teritory. The target is always a <a href=\"/appendix/drakalsi\">silt drake</a>. The hunt is the only time the females leave the relative safety of the nest. Even an evil tribe will not interfere with a tribe on a hunt. An air elemental is often summoned to help find the drake, but never takes part in the actual combat. Although the adult members of the tribe take part in the initial phases of the combat, it is the initiates who deliver the final, killing blows to me drake. Scars from the hunt are considered a mark of pride among all aarakocra.</p><p>The females spend about eight months of the year incubating their eggs. Athasian aarakocra mate for life and a pair normally produces as many as 10 offspring. A female lays one egg a year. Constant incubation is not required because of the high daytime temperatures, so the females can maintain the nest and keep the tribe's treasure in order.</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Ecology:</b> Athasian aarakocra are high on the food chain and have no natural enemies other than <a href=\"/appendix/drakatha\">drakes</a>. Unless evil, aarakocra leave their own territory only to hunt the silt drake and return as soon as possible when the hunt is over. (Evil aarakocra attack others, as noted above.) Aarakocra eggs and hatchlings are sought after by wealthy land owners who wish to use the creatures as scouts and sentries. An egg can bring as much as 10 cp in Tyr's marketplace. Tribes that have had eggs or hatchlings stolen have long memories and sometimes take revenge against the thief at a later date. Captive aarakocra join any tribe they come in contact with.</p><p>Athasian aarakocra have a natural life span of 21-30 years.</p><p></p><br clear=\"all\" style=\"clear:both; height:0;\">\r\n","images":["<img src=\"grf/ds.gif\" width=\"150\" height=\"75\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Dark Sun\" title=\"Dark Sun\" align=\"right\">","<img src=\"img/aarakath.gif\" alt=\"Aarakocra (Athas)\" title=\"Aarakocra (Athas)\" border=\"0\" width=\"300\" height=\"360\" style=\"text-align:right;\" align=\"right\">","<img src=\"grf/add2_01.gif\" width=\"200\" height=\"56\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Advanced Dungeons & Dragons 2nd Edition\">"],"setting":"Dark Sun","statblock":{"Aarakocra (Athas)":{"Activity Cycle":"Day","Alignment":"Any","Armor Class":"7","Climate/Terrain":"Deep desert","Damage/Attack":"1d3/1d3 or by weapon","Diet":"Carnivore","Frequency":"Rare","Hit Dice":"2+2","Intelligence":"Average (8-10)","Magic Resistance":"Nil","Morale":"Steady (11)","Movement":"6, Fl 36 (C)","No. Appearing":"1d10","No. of Attacks":"2","Organization":"Tribal","Size":"M (20'+ wingspan)","Special Attacks":"Nil","Special Defenses":"Nil","THAC0":"17","Treasure":"Varies","XP Value":"65"}},"title":"Aarakocra (Athas)"},"sources":["2433"],"statblock_names":[],"title":"Aarakocra (Athas)","prev_key":"zygraat","next_key":"aarakocr","monster_path":"/appendix/aarakath"}}},"pageContext":{"monster_key":"eeaar","monster_data":{"TSR":["2524"],"fullBody":"  <table cellspacing=\"0\" cellpadding=\"0\"><tr><th>Climate/Terrain:</th><td>Temperate and arctic/Mountains</td></tr><tr><th>Frequency:</th><td>Uncommon</td></tr><tr><th>Organization:</th><td>Clan</td></tr><tr><th>Activity Cycle:</th><td>Day</td></tr><tr><th>Diet:</th><td>Omnivore</td></tr><tr><th>Intelligence:</th><td>High (13-14)</td></tr><tr><th>Treasure:</th><td>R (F)</td></tr><tr><th>Alignment:</th><td>Neutral (lawful good)</td></tr><tr><th>No. Appearing:</th><td>2d4</td></tr><tr><th>Armor Class:</th><td>8</td></tr><tr><th>Movement:</th><td>16, Fl 24 (B)</td></tr><tr><th>Hit Dice:</th><td>2+1</td></tr><tr><th>THAC0:</th><td>19</td></tr><tr><th>No. of Attacks:</th><td>1</td></tr><tr><th>Damage/Attack:</th><td>1d8 (or by weapon)</td></tr><tr><th>Special Attacks:</th><td>Dive, elf abilities</td></tr><tr><th>Special Defenses:</th><td>Dancing maneuvers</td></tr><tr><th>Magic Resistance:</th><td>Nil</td></tr><tr><th>Size:</th><td>M (5-6' tall)</td></tr><tr><th>Morale:</th><td>Elite (13-14)</td></tr><tr><th>XP Value:</th><td>650</td></tr></table><p class=\"f\">Except for a pair of very large, feathered wings, ee'aar appear to be stocky <a href=\"/appendix/elf\">elves</a>. They posses the typical elven arched eyebrows, pointed ears, quick reflexes, and natural grace in movement. Though ee'aar eye color follows typical elf shades, it is of a paler wash than usual. The predominant hair color is silver or white, though some have been known to have lighter shades of auburn and blonde. Ee'aar also tend toward lean, well-muscled bodies and are slightly taller than their earthbound relatives.</p><p>The wings of an ee'aar spread almost 30% wider than the entire body length and, when folded, stretch from the heels to several inches above the head. Though feathers tend to be lighter in color - mostly white, gray, and light blue - perhaps as many as 40% of the ee'aar possess darker shades - such as brown, gold, and black.</p><p>Most ee'aar speak several languages. All know Aeshtyn, the standard ee'aar language, which is very soft and musical and carries well on the winds. Ee'aar also grow up around Nimmush, the language of the <a href=\"/appendix/enduk\">enduks</a>. Other languages would be those of any mountain-dwelling race or those races along the western edge of the Savage Coast. Ee'aar also gain the special elf abilities of infravision, resistance to <i>sleep</i> and <i>charm</i>, and heightened perception.</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Combat:</b> Ee'aar learn to fight on the ground as well as in the air. For purposes of combat, the average ee'aar should be considered a 2nd-level warrior, though many of them are much more proficient. They gain a +1 attack bonus with all normal swords and any one of the clan's hunting weapons - lasso, net, bolas, blowgun, or spear. Ee'aar can also use short bows with no penalty for being airborne. They generally stay away from bulky weapons such as two-handed swords and long bows.</p><p>On the ground, the ee'aar base AC is 8, due to its dexterity. They can wear leather armor, but most despise using anything so restricting (it changes flight maneuverability to class C). They never use full shields, but in rare cases a buckler might be employed. Ee'aar put high stock in improving their Armor Class with magic, such as <i>bracers</i> and <i>rings of protection</i>.</p><p>In the air, an ee'aar can use its greater speed and maneuverability to gain an additional -1 bonus to its overall Armor Class.</p><p>During melee, ee'aar can hover, allowing normal combat, or they can confine their aerial battle maneuvers to passing attacks and dives at the ground. A passing attack occurs when an ee'aar flies past another creature, making a single attack and possibly a defensive maneuver. Creatures with multiple attacks must be able to claim special consideration (a <i>haste</i> spell, special initiative rules, etc.) if more than one attack is to hit the ee'aar in a single pass. When attacking a ground-based opponent from the air, an ee'aar can employ a ranged weapon, land for melee combat, or make a diving attack with a melee weapon. Because the diving attack comes so swiftly, the ee'aar gains another -1 Armor Class bonus, the defender's Dexterity bonus is negated, and all attacks inflict double damage. This attack puts the ee'aar on more even footing with an armored opponent. Ee'aar can attempt this attack every round, but it cannot be used in conjunction with the dancing maneuvers described below.</p><p>Often, the ee'aar utilize dancing maneuvers in combat. This ability modifies their flying ability to make larger leaps, sharper turns, and faster spins. They literally appear to be dancing while engaged in melee attacks. This ability works similarly on the ground and in the air; it adjusts the ee'aar's Armor Class by one half its level. (A 4th-level ee'aar warrior receives a -2 AC bonus against any form of attack, except for area-affecting attacks.) The dancing maneuvers even provide a saving throw for one quarter damage from direct spell attacks like lightning. Wearing any form of armor or carrying a shield makes using this skill impossible. Also, an ee'aar cannot use this skill and simultaneously fire a missile weapon.</p><p>The ee'aar normally fly at a speed of 240 feet per round; however, this lowers to 60 feet per round if climbing straight up. A casual ascent of 45 degrees allows 120 feet of forward movement with 120 feet of ascent. When descending, the ee'aar can drop 1 foot for every foot moved forward, allowing 240 feet both forward and downward. They can also dive, which doubles their movement rate to 480 feet of movement both forward and downward. An ee'aar may carry up to 50 pounds of weight plus 5 pounds for every point of Strength without penalty. After that, its movement rate drops to half, and its maneuverability drops to C.</p><p>An ee'aar must make a Constitution check for each hour of flight. If this check fails, it must land and rest one-half hour for every hour spent recently in the air. Constitution checks are subject to a penalty of -1 for each 50 pounds (or fraction thereof) of weight carried above the initial 50. A further penalty is assessed at -1 per 5,000 feet of altitude above the first 5,000, with a maximum ceiling of 20,000 feet. However, if favorable wind conditions are present (such as a strong mountain updraft or good steady sea breeze) the ee'aar may glide and receive a +4 bonus to its check.</p><p>As with all flying creatures, an ee'aar must land immediately if its hit points are fall below 50% of maximum. Flight (even gliding) becomes impossible if 75% of its overall hit points are lost, and if already airborne, the ee'aar will fall from the sky. If 25% of the ee'aar's total hit points in damage is applied directly to its wings, it must land immediately; 50% prevents any flight until healed.</p><p>Due to their size, the wings have an AC rating 1 point worse than the ee'aar itself. Also, armor never covers the wings, possibly widening this gap. The wings cannot be hit by a frontal attack unless the attacker is taller than the ee'aar. If attacked from the side, an attack too low to successfully hit the ee'aar's AC but high enough to hit the wing AC is applied to the wings. Wings cannot be specifically targeted except in a rear attack; a successful attack from behind always hits the wings. Wings also suffer an extra 1d6 points of damage per round if exposed directly to flame. The wings will keep burning until the ee'aar loses more than 75% of its normal hit points or action is taken to extinguish the flames.</p><p>Recovering from direct damage to the wings takes 1 full week for each 10 of the ee'aar's total hit points. <i>Cure</i> spells will heal damage but will not regrow feathers, so flight is still not possible. <i>Regeneration</i> and <i>heal</i> spells will replace feathers. Magical healing always applies to direct wing damage last. As the percentages fall below 75% and 50% (or 50% and 25% as applied to direct wing damage), the ee'aar regains the ability to glide and, then, fly. Also, an ee'aar regains additional hit points for healing wing damage according to its Constitution bonus. (An ee'aar with a 16 Constitution heals an extra 2 points per week.)</p><p>The ee'aar have extreme claustrophobia. Ee'aar that are confined must make a Wisdom check each day or become temporarily insane. This can be cured by a <i>heal</i> or <i>cure disease</i> spell. Four missed checks in any period of confinement makes the condition permanent, cured by nothing short of a <i>wish</i> or <i>limited wish</i>.</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Habitat/Society:</b> The ee'aar normally live in the mountains on the Arm of the Immortals peninsula. They have adapted to the cold and can survive comfortably with little more than light, down-lined fur tunics, soft leather boots, and thick leggings. Only recently have they come down from those heights to join their enduk friends in the Savage Coast lands. It takes an ee'aar months to get used to the warmth and humidity of the lowlands, especially in the tropics the enduk favor. Anywhere along the Savage Coast, other than the area directly surrounding Um-Shedu, ee'aar are a rare sight.</p><p>Ee'aar live in family communities called aeries. An ee'aar village is made up of several aeries, while in a city, aeries can number in the hundreds. Every ee'aar works toward the survival and improvement of the clan, as well as the welfare of the entire ee'aar community. Those clans considered noble are responsible for leading the others. A noble clan is not a permanent endowment; the honor is bestowed on those with a proven history of successful leadership. Noble lines sometimes relinquish this honor to another clan which has proven more worthy, contenting themselves with a place of honor in the armies the ee'aar maintain for defense.</p><p>Though they have their own language (Aeshtyn), the ee'aar follow many standard elven practices, including arranged marriages. A mate is usually selected from another clan of equal social standing; sometimes, interclan marriages occur if an orphan was adopted into the clan. The ee'aar very rarely have twins, but they do have children more frequently than other elves.</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Ecology:</b> Ee'aar generally have little to do with other races besides the enduks. While they consider their ways superior, the ee'aar do not lord it over other races. They simply recognize the benefits their long history gives them over the &ldquo;infant&rdquo; races. The ee'aar have even been known to assist some of these races, like they did with the enduks, helping them to reclaim their lands from the <a href=\"/appendix/manscorn\">manscorpions</a>.</p><p>   Despite their reserved demeanor, ee'aar craft elaborate jewelry, delicate figurines, and ornate weapons. Their cultural artwork is in high demand throughout most of the Savage Coast, bringing high prices where it is available.</p><p></p><br clear=\"all\" style=\"clear:both; height:0;\">\r\n","images":["<img src=\"grf/rs.gif\" width=\"150\" height=\"75\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Red Steel (Mystara)\" title=\"Red Steel (Mystara)\" align=\"right\">","<img src=\"img/eeaar.gif\" alt=\"Ee'aar\" title=\"Ee'aar\" border=\"0\" width=\"300\" height=\"360\" style=\"text-align:right;\" align=\"right\">","<img src=\"grf/add2_01.gif\" width=\"200\" height=\"56\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Advanced Dungeons & Dragons 2nd Edition\">"],"setting":"Red Steel (Mystara)","statblock":{"Ee'aar":{"Activity Cycle":"Day","Alignment":"Neutral (lawful good)","Armor Class":"8","Climate/Terrain":"Temperate and arctic/Mountains","Damage/Attack":"1d8 (or by weapon)","Diet":"Omnivore","Frequency":"Uncommon","Hit Dice":"2+1","Intelligence":"High (13-14)","Magic Resistance":"Nil","Morale":"Elite (13-14)","Movement":"16, Fl 24 (B)","No. Appearing":"2d4","No. of Attacks":"1","Organization":"Clan","Size":"M (5-6' tall)","Special Attacks":"Dive, elf abilities","Special Defenses":"Dancing maneuvers","THAC0":"19","Treasure":"R (F)","XP Value":"650"}},"title":"Ee'aar"},"sources":["2524"],"statblock_names":[],"title":"Ee'aar","prev_key":"echyan","next_key":"eel","monster_path":"/appendix/eeaar"}},"staticQueryHashes":[],"slicesMap":{}}
