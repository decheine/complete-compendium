While the powers listed above are the most common, some aarakocra have different or additional powers.</p><p class=\"f\">A race of intelligent, birdlike creatures living in the deepest deserts of Athas, the rare Athasian <a href=\"/appendix/aarakocr\">aarakocra</a> spends its time soaring on thermals in search of food.</p><p>The aarakocra is 7 to 8 feet tall with a wingspan of 20 feet or more. Because of its large wingspan, an aarakocra can carry as much as 75% of its own body weight and still fly easily. An aarakocra can fly a short distance carrying a burden equaling 125% of its own body weight. The average body weight of a full grown male is 100 pounds and a female is 85 pounds.</p><p>Each wing has a &ldquo;hand&rdquo; at its midpoint, consisting of three fingers and an opposable thumb. The fourth finger forms the rigid leading edge of the wing. In flight the hands cannot be used, but on the ground the aarakocra can use its hands almost as a human would. The aarakocra's body is protected by a thin bony plate on the chest, much like a solid rib cage. Talons on its legs can be used as claws and can be retracted to reveal a second set of hands, also with three fingers and an opposable thumb. Except for the chest plate, the entire skeleton is hollow and extremely fragile.</p><p>From a distance, the Athasian aarakocra resembles a huge <a href=\"/appendix/bird\">vulture</a>. Its black eyes, set in the front of the head, provide excellent vision over a long range. The plumage is generally black with a white collar for adult males and black or brown with a smaller white collar for females. Adolescents are a mixture of brown and black. The beak is large and covers most of the head. Plumage begins at the crown of the head and is darker near the head, except for the collar. Athasian aarakocra speak their own language and the languages of vultures and other large birds. Some speak the common tongue (5% to 10% chance depending on how deep in the wastelands a tribe lives).</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Combat:</b> Aarakocra can fight in the air or on the ground. They prefer aerial combat since their bones are too fragile to withstand a solid blow from a human-sized opponent. In combat against creatures on the ground, they prefer to fly over their victim and drop weighted nets. Some aarakocra use darts to harass ground-based opponents.</p><p>If their opponents can fly, the aarakocra generally forgo the use of the net, although large groups sometimes use nets on flying creatures. Normally, aarakocra attack flying creatures with long spears, diving from above and allowing the momentum to carry the spear through the target. Such an attack doubles the damage if the aarakocra have been able to dive at least 50 feet. Only the very largest aarakocra can carry more than one of these spears, they can attack with both at once with no penalty, causing double damage on each strike. All diving attacks are made at +4 and should be treated as a charge attack. All other penalties and restrictions of charge attacks apply.</p><p>The effect of the aarakocra's nets depends on if the opponent is flying at the time it becomes entangled. Creatures on the ground that are hit by a net are entangled and unable to participate in any combat until they make a successful Strength check to get free of the net. Flying creatures hit by a net can no longer fly and immediately begin falling. If they cannot escape the net or use some magical means to arrest the fall, normal falling damage applies.</p><p>Unless victims are entangled in nets, aarakocra are cautious in ground combat. If the aarakocra outnumber their opponents they advance in a straight line and thrust with their spears. If outnumbered, or the opponents are particularly tough, the aarakocra withdraw. Victims entangled in nets are killed or incapacitated for use as food or ransom.</p><p>Athasian aarakocra are mindful of their physical limitations as well as their comparatively low psionic abilities. They do not normally initiate psionic combat. At the first sign of psionic powers from any of their victims, however, all aarakocra that have some ability will use whatever attack and defense modes they can in an attempt to destroy the threat. Large groups of is or more aarakocra may initiate psionic combat if their leaders feel they can win quickly and avoid physical combat.</p><p>In desperation, an aarakocra can attempt to bite an opponent in combat. Because of the unwieldiness of its beak, the aarakocra has a THAC0 of 18 if attacking with this appendage. Further, the birdman causes only 1d2 points of damage with the beak.</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Habitat/Society:</b> Athasian aarakocra live in tribes with 6-20 (2d8+4) members, depending on the prestige of the leader. The largest tribe ever recorded had 50 members. The tribal hunting territory depends on the size of the tribe, usually about 500 square miles for a tribe of 10 members. There are no rigid boundaries between tribes and border disputes are not uncommon.</p><p>Alignments of tribe members are similar to the alignment of the leader. A tribe that has a leader who is neutral good may have neutral good, chaotic good, lawful good, and true neutral members. A predominantly evil tribe does not recognize boundaries with other tribes and treats other tribes as inferior beings to be eliminated.</p><p>Athasian aarakocra aren't happy in enclosed spaces, but they they take refuge in a cave or building if necessary.</p><p>Nonevil tribes live in rocky aeries in the highest peaks they can find. Evil tribes are normally nomadic and use an aerie made by another tribe if they need to remain in an area for a long time, even if they have to evict the tribe that made the nest.</p><p>Aarakocra aren't friendly toward intruders in their territory, especially caravans. They try to extract a toll from the caravan for passage through the desert. Good-aligned tribes allow unhindered passage of caravans that pay a tribute. If someone refuses to pay the tribute, the aarakocra try to capture scouts or outriders from the party and hold them until an even larger tribute is paid. The payment may be either livestock or shiny objects. Aarakocra are smart enough not to be taken in by glass baubles instead of gems, although they cannot tell the difference between the more common gems and the rare ones.</p><p>Evil tribes ask for tribute and often attack a caravan whether it pays or not. Aarakocra always demand shiny objects such as stones. These tribes find humans and demihumans to be quite tasty and prefer them to other food.</p><p>Good-aligned tribes of aarakocra sometimes return a lost traveler to the edge of the desert after first removing any valuables the traveler may be carrying. On very rare occasions a tribe might return a lost group of travelers to the more frequently traveled parts of the desert, again after first taking any valuables as payment.</p><p>The oldest male is the leader of the tribal hunting party and has 4+4 Hit Dice. The oldest female is in charge of the tribal aerie and has 3+3 HD. In tribes that have more than 15 members, the next oldest aarakocra serves as shaman and has 3+3 HD; the shaman completes the triumvirate necessary for proper worship and the summoning of elementals. (Interestingly, no magic-using aarakocra has ever been recorded.) Tribes without a shaman cannot summon <a href=\"/appendix/element1\">air elementals</a>, which is an important part of aarakocra culture.</p><p>The shaman is the leader of the daily sun worship. Aarakocra worship the sun because it provides them with the thermals they need to soar in search of food. The shaman also leads the mystic rituals used to summon an air elemental. Summoning an air elemental is usually done only in preparation for the tribe's most sacred ceremony, the hunt. Small tribes must band together for this ceremony to allow the triumvirate to be formed.</p><p>The ceremony to summon an air elemental must be conducted at dawn and requires the oldest male and female to emit a highpitched keening whistle. The shaman conducts an intricate dance around them, simultaneously chanting an ancient summoning mantra.</p><p>The hunt is the final part of the initiation of adolescent aarakocra to adulthood and often takes the tribe far from their normal teritory. The target is always a <a href=\"/appendix/drakalsi\">silt drake</a>. The hunt is the only time the females leave the relative safety of the nest. Even an evil tribe will not interfere with a tribe on a hunt. An air elemental is often summoned to help find the drake, but never takes part in the actual combat. Although the adult members of the tribe take part in the initial phases of the combat, it is the initiates who deliver the final, killing blows to me drake. Scars from the hunt are considered a mark of pride among all aarakocra.</p><p>The females spend about eight months of the year incubating their eggs. Athasian aarakocra mate for life and a pair normally produces as many as 10 offspring. A female lays one egg a year. Constant incubation is not required because of the high daytime temperatures, so the females can maintain the nest and keep the tribe's treasure in order.</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Ecology:</b> Athasian aarakocra are high on the food chain and have no natural enemies other than <a href=\"/appendix/drakatha\">drakes</a>. Unless evil, aarakocra leave their own territory only to hunt the silt drake and return as soon as possible when the hunt is over. (Evil aarakocra attack others, as noted above.) Aarakocra eggs and hatchlings are sought after by wealthy land owners who wish to use the creatures as scouts and sentries. An egg can bring as much as 10 cp in Tyr's marketplace. Tribes that have had eggs or hatchlings stolen have long memories and sometimes take revenge against the thief at a later date. Captive aarakocra join any tribe they come in contact with.</p><p>Athasian aarakocra have a natural life span of 21-30 years.</p><p></p><br clear=\"all\" style=\"clear:both; height:0;\">\r\n","images":["<img src=\"grf/ds.gif\" width=\"150\" height=\"75\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Dark Sun\" title=\"Dark Sun\" align=\"right\">","<img src=\"img/aarakath.gif\" alt=\"Aarakocra (Athas)\" title=\"Aarakocra (Athas)\" border=\"0\" width=\"300\" height=\"360\" style=\"text-align:right;\" align=\"right\">","<img src=\"grf/add2_01.gif\" width=\"200\" height=\"56\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Advanced Dungeons & Dragons 2nd Edition\">"],"setting":"Dark Sun","statblock":{"Aarakocra (Athas)":{"Activity Cycle":"Day","Alignment":"Any","Armor Class":"7","Climate/Terrain":"Deep desert","Damage/Attack":"1d3/1d3 or by weapon","Diet":"Carnivore","Frequency":"Rare","Hit Dice":"2+2","Intelligence":"Average (8-10)","Magic Resistance":"Nil","Morale":"Steady (11)","Movement":"6, Fl 36 (C)","No. Appearing":"1d10","No. of Attacks":"2","Organization":"Tribal","Size":"M (20'+ wingspan)","Special Attacks":"Nil","Special Defenses":"Nil","THAC0":"17","Treasure":"Varies","XP Value":"65"}},"title":"Aarakocra (Athas)"},"sources":["2433"],"statblock_names":[],"title":"Aarakocra (Athas)","prev_key":"zygraat","next_key":"aarakocr","monster_path":"/appendix/aarakath"}}},"pageContext":{"monster_key":"lichdefi","monster_data":{"TSR":["2153"],"fullBody":"  <table cellspacing=\"0\" cellpadding=\"0\"><tr><th>Climate/Terrain:</th><td>Athas or Ravenloft</td></tr><tr><th>Frequency:</th><td>Very rare</td></tr><tr><th>Organization:</th><td>Solitary</td></tr><tr><th>Activity Cycle:</th><td>Any</td></tr><tr><th>Diet:</th><td>None</td></tr><tr><th>Intelligence:</th><td>Supra-genius (19-20)</td></tr><tr><th>Treasure:</th><td>R,X (E)</td></tr><tr><th>Alignment:</th><td>Chaotic evil</td></tr><tr><th>No. Appearing:</th><td>1</td></tr><tr><th>Armor Class:</th><td>0</td></tr><tr><th>Movement:</th><td>6</td></tr><tr><th>Hit Dice:</th><td>11+</td></tr><tr><th>THAC0:</th><td>9</td></tr><tr><th>No. of Attacks:</th><td>1</td></tr><tr><th>Damage/Attack:</th><td>By weapon or 1d10</td></tr><tr><th>Special Attacks:</th><td>See below</td></tr><tr><th>Special Defenses:</th><td>+1 or better weapons to hit</td></tr><tr><th>Magic Resistance:</th><td>Nil</td></tr><tr><th>Size:</th><td>M (6')</td></tr><tr><th>Morale:</th><td>Fanatic (17)</td></tr><tr><th>XP Value:</th><td>8,000</td></tr></table><p class=\"f\"><b>Psionics Summary</b></p><table class=\"ip\"><tr class=\"bk\"><th>Level</th><th>Dis/Sci/Dev</th><th>Attack/Defense</th><th>Score</th><th>PSPs</th></tr><tr class=\"cn\"><td>10</td><td>4/5/15</td><td>all/all</td><td>15</td><td>120</td></tr></table><p class=\"ni\"><b>Telepathy -</b> <i>Sciences:</i> domination, ejection, mind link; <i>Devotions:</i> aversion, awe, contact, conceal thoughts, ESP, life detection, send thoughts.</p><p class=\"ni\"><b>Psychokinesis -</b> <i>Science:</i> ; <i>Devotions:</i> control body, control winds, levitation, soften.</p><p class=\"ni\"><b>Psychoportation -</b> <i>Science:</i> teleport; <i>Devotions:</i> dimensional door, dimension walk, time/space anchor.</p><p class=\"f\">Though there is nothing more loathsome than the foul undead, the defiler <a href=\"/appendix/lich\">lich</a> raises even this putrid circle of fiends to new levels of destruction and malevolence. Some that tread across the blasted domains of these creatures have heard them called by another name: <a href=\"/appendix/kaisharg\"><i>kaisharga</i></a>.</p><p>Defiler liches look like gaunt and skeletal <a href=\"/appendix/wight\">wights</a> or <a href=\"/appendix/mummy\">mummies</a>. Tiny green points of light float in the blackness of their empty eye sockets and their bony fingers can quickly flay the flesh from the bones of an unarmored man.</p><p>All liches are arrogant creatures, so most dress in the clothes of local nobility or elaborate garb reminiscent of the profession they held before their transition to unlike. Even the fanciest of garments does little to hide their true appearance. however. Defiler liches emanate an aura of atrophy that slowly rots their clothes and anything around them. Cloaks begin to tatter, sleeves fray, and fruit at the same table as the defiler will quickly turn brown and spoiled.</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Combat:</b> Like other liches, defilers rarely engage in melee combat with their foes. If forced, however, the lich is more than able to stand up to all but the strongest opponents. The effective Strength, Dexterity, and Constitution scores of a kaisharga rise to 20 at the moment it assumes its undead state. In addition, any psionic powers that the defiler might have had in life are greatly magnified.</p><p>Simply approaching a defiler lich is enough to test the mettle of most opponents. Any creature of less than 5 Hit Dice (or 5th level) who sees the defiler must make a saving throw vs. spell or flee in terror for 5-20 (5d4) rounds.</p><p>The touch of a defiler lich is slightly different from that of its cousins. Those touched by the thing feel their magical essence drawn from the very marrow of their bones. Nollspellcasters suffer 1-10 points of damage from this attack; spellcasters (wizards and priests) are much more sensitive and lose 2-20 hit points per touch.</p><p>Liches can only be hit by weapons of at least +1 enchantment, magical spells. or by monsters with at least 4+1 Hit Dice or magical powers of their own. The magical nature of the lich and its undead state make it utterly immune to <i>charm</i>, <i>sleep</i>, <i>enfeeblement</i>, <i>polymorph</i>, <i>cold</i>, <i>electricity</i>, <i>insanity</i>, or <i>death</i> spells. Priests of at least 8th level can attempt to turn a lich, as can paladins of no less than 10th level.</p><p>Of course, the most powerful ability of the defiler lich is its vast repertoire of spells. Defilers have the same spell casting ability as a living wizard of equivalent Hit Dice. They often have spells never before seen by other eyes, however, as well as a plethora of magical weapons, devices, and potions. Liches have usually had centuries to create the magical artifacts that surround them, so their effects and abilities are often well suited to the creature's environment, lair, and temperament.</p><p>What truly sets the defiler lich apart from its cousins is the strange effect its spellcasting, and indeed its very presence, has on the environment around it. Defilers draw their energy from the living things of the world. It is a quicker and dirtier process that makes casting easier, but at the expense of the land and beings in the area. This process literally turns plant life to ash. Its effect on the living is less traumatic, though extremely painful.</p><p>The radius of this effect depends upon two things: the abundance of vegetation in the area. and the level of the spell cast.</p><table class=\"ip\"><caption>Defiler Magical Destruction Table</caption><tr class=\"bk\"><th>Terrain Type</th><th colspan=\"9\" style=\"text-align:center;\" align=\"center\">Spell Level</th></tr><tr class=\"bk\"><th> </th><th>1</th><th>2</th><th>3</th><th>4</th><th>5</th><th>6</th><th>7</th><th>8</th><th>9</th></tr><tr><td>Stony Barrens</td><td>10</td><td>14</td><td>17</td><td>20</td><td>22</td><td>24</td><td>26</td><td>28</td><td>30</td></tr><tr><td>Mountains, rocky</td><td>10</td><td>14</td><td>17</td><td>20</td><td>22</td><td>24</td><td>26</td><td>28</td><td>30</td></tr><tr><td>Seashore, beach</td><td>10</td><td>14</td><td>17</td><td>20</td><td>22</td><td>24</td><td>26</td><td>28</td><td>30</td></tr><tr><td>Seashore, grassy</td><td>3</td><td>4</td><td>4</td><td>5</td><td>5</td><td>5</td><td>5</td><td>6</td><td>6</td></tr><tr><td>Forest</td><td>1</td><td>1</td><td>2</td><td>2</td><td>2</td><td>2</td><td>2</td><td>3</td><td>3</td></tr><tr><td>City</td><td>10</td><td>14</td><td>17</td><td>20</td><td>22</td><td>24</td><td>26</td><td>28</td><td>30</td></tr><tr><td>Village</td><td>3</td><td>4</td><td>4</td><td>5</td><td>5</td><td>5</td><td>5</td><td>6</td><td>6</td></tr></table>\r\n<p>The number shown is the radius, in yards, around the defiler where all vegetation is turned to ash. The effect is instantaneous with the casting of the spell. If a defiler casts more than one spell from the same location, the radius of destroyed vegetation expands around it. Consult the Defiler Magical Destruction Table for the highest level spell cast from that location, then add one yard for every other spell cast. Spells equal to the highest level spell are treated as additional spells.</p><p>Though usually only plants are destroyed within this radius, living creatures suffer great pain. Any being in the radius of a defiler lich's magic suffers an immediate initiative modifier penalty equal to the level of the defiler spell cast. No matter how high the resulting initiative roll, though, the pain can never keep a character from performing an action during a round. The initiative penalty only postpones when the action occurs.</p><p>Animate plants in the area of effect, such as <a href=\"/appendix/treaunde\">undead treants</a> or <a href=\"/appendix/lashweed\">lashweeds</a>, suffer greatly from defiler spells. Only their high level of innate magical energy keeps them from being destroyed outright. Any plant fated with Hit Dice takes 1d4 points of damage for every level of the spell that affects it. Thus, a patch of lashweed in the destruction radius of a fifth level spell would take 5d4 points of damage each.</p><p>Any plant-based spell components within the area of effect are ruined.</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Habitat/Society:</b> In life, defiler liches were spellcasters of great power who learned to garner their magical energies from the very land around them. Trees, grasses, and the very essence of all living things provide fuel for their infernal spells.</p><p>No one seems to know where the first defiler lich came from. With the many gapes and portals existing in the demiplane, it is most likely that the foul things came from some other place far removed from Ravenloft. Rumors abound that the world of their origin was blasted into desert by their ilk, but thus far no proof has been offered of this theory.</p><p>What is evident is that the rich forests of the Ravenloft realms provide a virtually unlimited power source for their small numbers. Of course, this very same advantage can often be the first clue that such a creature has entered an area. If once lush forests suddenly turn to lifeless gray ash, few will doubt that there is a defiler in the land.</p><p>Due to the very nature of a defiler's magic, its lair is normally devoid of vegetation. Underground lairs may lie beneath blasted heaths, ruined keeps have none of the typical ivy growing up the side, and any haven is likely to lie in the midst of a gray and dusty plain. Defilers will often use illusions to cover their abodes, but an astute adventurer will notice the dusty film that covers his gear and collects in his throat and eyes.</p><p>The ash created by defiler magic is black and gray, completely devoid of life or life-giving elements. Nothing will grow in an area of ash for one year. The ash itself is very light and usually blows away, leaving behind a lifeless, circular scar on the ground. Even with the ash gone, though, the defiler's magic has leeched all life-giving nutrients from the soil, so that a defiled area may take many years to recover, if it ever does.</p><p>There are rumors that many of the defiler lichee chased from places like Barovia or Falkonovia have migrated to the more familiar environment of Bluetspur. Some even say that several of these fiends have stricken unholy alliances with the <a href=\"/appendix/mindflay\">illithids</a> that live there. If this is true, it is likely that the defilers will use their allies to push their way back into lands with more flora to power their ruinous magical arts.</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Ecology:</b> Defilers have the same basic goals that other liches have; the eventual ascension to demilich status and even transcendence to other planes and forms of existence. In the meantime however, these undead fiends have thousands of years in which to wait impatiently for some condition or circumstance. During this period their evil plots often grow far beyond the comprehension of mere mortals.</p><p>Defiler liches gain their status in the same way that other liches do. This includes the construction of a phylactery and its enchantment. Adventurers seeking to battle such a creature would do well to locate the fiend's phylactery and focus their efforts on it.</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Demi-Defilers</b></p>  <p class=\"ni\">Defiler demiliches gain the same benefits and invulnerabilities as others of that ilk. The major difference between the two is the nature of the demilich's <i>curse</i> ability. All demiliches can pronounce a single <i>curse</i> on anyone who disturbs them. This can be incredibly powerful, such as always being hit by one's enemies, never making a saving throw, or never being able to wield magical items.</p><p>In addition to this however, the <i>curse</i> of the defiler dooms one to an aura of entropy that kills all plant life in a radius equal to the character's level, in feet. The effect isn't as sudden or dramatic as that of the defiler's own spellcasting, but it can be devastating nonetheless. Within one minute, all flowers, leaves, or other light vegetation turns brown and begins to wilt. Within one turn, light vegetation is withered and dead. Trees and other larger plants develop dark blotches of disease-ridden bark or stems. In one half hour, light vegetation crumbles to dust. Trees and the like rot and may collapse, turning to ash one hour later. Animated plant-based lifeforms take 1d4 points of damage per round spent within the cursed character's aura of entropy. Spell components and similar organic things must make a saving throw vs. disintegration or crumble into dust.</p><p></p><p class=\"f\"><b>Optional Rule</b></p>  <p class=\"ni\">Druids and rangers are very sensitive to the land and cannot tolerate the presence of such a blasphemous creature in their midst. Should either of these character types enter the blasted realm of a defiler lich or demilich, they should stop at nothing to find the source of the contagion and eliminate it. Those that turn their back on the situation will forever feel haunted, and their deities may disfavor them. The Dungeon Master should deny the druid or the ranger the use of some ability formerly granted to them by their patron. A druid might lose a granted power or a ranger may lose his ability to becalm wild beasts.</p><p>If the druid or the ranger takes part in defeating the kaisharga, the DM should award them an extra 10% of the creature's experience point value including minions and henchmen.</p><p></p><br clear=\"all\" style=\"clear:both; height:0;\">\r\n","images":["<img src=\"grf/ds.gif\" width=\"150\" height=\"75\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Dark Sun\" title=\"Dark Sun\" align=\"right\">","<img src=\"img/lichdefi.gif\" alt=\"Lich, Defiler\" title=\"Lich, Defiler\" border=\"0\" width=\"300\" height=\"360\" style=\"text-align:right;\" align=\"right\">","<img src=\"grf/add2_01.gif\" width=\"200\" height=\"56\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Advanced Dungeons & Dragons 2nd Edition\">"],"setting":"Dark Sun","statblock":{"Lich, Defiler":{"Activity Cycle":"Any","Alignment":"Chaotic evil","Armor Class":"0","Climate/Terrain":"Athas or Ravenloft","Damage/Attack":"By weapon or 1d10","Diet":"None","Frequency":"Very rare","Hit Dice":"11+","Intelligence":"Supra-genius (19-20)","Magic Resistance":"Nil","Morale":"Fanatic (17)","Movement":"6","No. Appearing":"1","No. of Attacks":"1","Organization":"Solitary","Size":"M (6')","Special Attacks":"See below","Special Defenses":"+1 or better weapons to hit","THAC0":"9","Treasure":"R,X (E)","XP Value":"8,000"}},"title":"Lich, Defiler"},"sources":["2153"],"statblock_names":[],"title":"Lich, Defiler","prev_key":"lichbard","next_key":"lichdrow","monster_path":"/appendix/lichdefi"}},"staticQueryHashes":[],"slicesMap":{}}
