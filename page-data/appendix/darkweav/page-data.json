While the powers listed above are the most common, some aarakocra have different or additional powers.</p><p class=\"f\">A race of intelligent, birdlike creatures living in the deepest deserts of Athas, the rare Athasian <a href=\"/appendix/aarakocr\">aarakocra</a> spends its time soaring on thermals in search of food.</p><p>The aarakocra is 7 to 8 feet tall with a wingspan of 20 feet or more. Because of its large wingspan, an aarakocra can carry as much as 75% of its own body weight and still fly easily. An aarakocra can fly a short distance carrying a burden equaling 125% of its own body weight. The average body weight of a full grown male is 100 pounds and a female is 85 pounds.</p><p>Each wing has a &ldquo;hand&rdquo; at its midpoint, consisting of three fingers and an opposable thumb. The fourth finger forms the rigid leading edge of the wing. In flight the hands cannot be used, but on the ground the aarakocra can use its hands almost as a human would. The aarakocra's body is protected by a thin bony plate on the chest, much like a solid rib cage. Talons on its legs can be used as claws and can be retracted to reveal a second set of hands, also with three fingers and an opposable thumb. Except for the chest plate, the entire skeleton is hollow and extremely fragile.</p><p>From a distance, the Athasian aarakocra resembles a huge <a href=\"/appendix/bird\">vulture</a>. Its black eyes, set in the front of the head, provide excellent vision over a long range. The plumage is generally black with a white collar for adult males and black or brown with a smaller white collar for females. Adolescents are a mixture of brown and black. The beak is large and covers most of the head. Plumage begins at the crown of the head and is darker near the head, except for the collar. Athasian aarakocra speak their own language and the languages of vultures and other large birds. Some speak the common tongue (5% to 10% chance depending on how deep in the wastelands a tribe lives).</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Combat:</b> Aarakocra can fight in the air or on the ground. They prefer aerial combat since their bones are too fragile to withstand a solid blow from a human-sized opponent. In combat against creatures on the ground, they prefer to fly over their victim and drop weighted nets. Some aarakocra use darts to harass ground-based opponents.</p><p>If their opponents can fly, the aarakocra generally forgo the use of the net, although large groups sometimes use nets on flying creatures. Normally, aarakocra attack flying creatures with long spears, diving from above and allowing the momentum to carry the spear through the target. Such an attack doubles the damage if the aarakocra have been able to dive at least 50 feet. Only the very largest aarakocra can carry more than one of these spears, they can attack with both at once with no penalty, causing double damage on each strike. All diving attacks are made at +4 and should be treated as a charge attack. All other penalties and restrictions of charge attacks apply.</p><p>The effect of the aarakocra's nets depends on if the opponent is flying at the time it becomes entangled. Creatures on the ground that are hit by a net are entangled and unable to participate in any combat until they make a successful Strength check to get free of the net. Flying creatures hit by a net can no longer fly and immediately begin falling. If they cannot escape the net or use some magical means to arrest the fall, normal falling damage applies.</p><p>Unless victims are entangled in nets, aarakocra are cautious in ground combat. If the aarakocra outnumber their opponents they advance in a straight line and thrust with their spears. If outnumbered, or the opponents are particularly tough, the aarakocra withdraw. Victims entangled in nets are killed or incapacitated for use as food or ransom.</p><p>Athasian aarakocra are mindful of their physical limitations as well as their comparatively low psionic abilities. They do not normally initiate psionic combat. At the first sign of psionic powers from any of their victims, however, all aarakocra that have some ability will use whatever attack and defense modes they can in an attempt to destroy the threat. Large groups of is or more aarakocra may initiate psionic combat if their leaders feel they can win quickly and avoid physical combat.</p><p>In desperation, an aarakocra can attempt to bite an opponent in combat. Because of the unwieldiness of its beak, the aarakocra has a THAC0 of 18 if attacking with this appendage. Further, the birdman causes only 1d2 points of damage with the beak.</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Habitat/Society:</b> Athasian aarakocra live in tribes with 6-20 (2d8+4) members, depending on the prestige of the leader. The largest tribe ever recorded had 50 members. The tribal hunting territory depends on the size of the tribe, usually about 500 square miles for a tribe of 10 members. There are no rigid boundaries between tribes and border disputes are not uncommon.</p><p>Alignments of tribe members are similar to the alignment of the leader. A tribe that has a leader who is neutral good may have neutral good, chaotic good, lawful good, and true neutral members. A predominantly evil tribe does not recognize boundaries with other tribes and treats other tribes as inferior beings to be eliminated.</p><p>Athasian aarakocra aren't happy in enclosed spaces, but they they take refuge in a cave or building if necessary.</p><p>Nonevil tribes live in rocky aeries in the highest peaks they can find. Evil tribes are normally nomadic and use an aerie made by another tribe if they need to remain in an area for a long time, even if they have to evict the tribe that made the nest.</p><p>Aarakocra aren't friendly toward intruders in their territory, especially caravans. They try to extract a toll from the caravan for passage through the desert. Good-aligned tribes allow unhindered passage of caravans that pay a tribute. If someone refuses to pay the tribute, the aarakocra try to capture scouts or outriders from the party and hold them until an even larger tribute is paid. The payment may be either livestock or shiny objects. Aarakocra are smart enough not to be taken in by glass baubles instead of gems, although they cannot tell the difference between the more common gems and the rare ones.</p><p>Evil tribes ask for tribute and often attack a caravan whether it pays or not. Aarakocra always demand shiny objects such as stones. These tribes find humans and demihumans to be quite tasty and prefer them to other food.</p><p>Good-aligned tribes of aarakocra sometimes return a lost traveler to the edge of the desert after first removing any valuables the traveler may be carrying. On very rare occasions a tribe might return a lost group of travelers to the more frequently traveled parts of the desert, again after first taking any valuables as payment.</p><p>The oldest male is the leader of the tribal hunting party and has 4+4 Hit Dice. The oldest female is in charge of the tribal aerie and has 3+3 HD. In tribes that have more than 15 members, the next oldest aarakocra serves as shaman and has 3+3 HD; the shaman completes the triumvirate necessary for proper worship and the summoning of elementals. (Interestingly, no magic-using aarakocra has ever been recorded.) Tribes without a shaman cannot summon <a href=\"/appendix/element1\">air elementals</a>, which is an important part of aarakocra culture.</p><p>The shaman is the leader of the daily sun worship. Aarakocra worship the sun because it provides them with the thermals they need to soar in search of food. The shaman also leads the mystic rituals used to summon an air elemental. Summoning an air elemental is usually done only in preparation for the tribe's most sacred ceremony, the hunt. Small tribes must band together for this ceremony to allow the triumvirate to be formed.</p><p>The ceremony to summon an air elemental must be conducted at dawn and requires the oldest male and female to emit a highpitched keening whistle. The shaman conducts an intricate dance around them, simultaneously chanting an ancient summoning mantra.</p><p>The hunt is the final part of the initiation of adolescent aarakocra to adulthood and often takes the tribe far from their normal teritory. The target is always a <a href=\"/appendix/drakalsi\">silt drake</a>. The hunt is the only time the females leave the relative safety of the nest. Even an evil tribe will not interfere with a tribe on a hunt. An air elemental is often summoned to help find the drake, but never takes part in the actual combat. Although the adult members of the tribe take part in the initial phases of the combat, it is the initiates who deliver the final, killing blows to me drake. Scars from the hunt are considered a mark of pride among all aarakocra.</p><p>The females spend about eight months of the year incubating their eggs. Athasian aarakocra mate for life and a pair normally produces as many as 10 offspring. A female lays one egg a year. Constant incubation is not required because of the high daytime temperatures, so the females can maintain the nest and keep the tribe's treasure in order.</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Ecology:</b> Athasian aarakocra are high on the food chain and have no natural enemies other than <a href=\"/appendix/drakatha\">drakes</a>. Unless evil, aarakocra leave their own territory only to hunt the silt drake and return as soon as possible when the hunt is over. (Evil aarakocra attack others, as noted above.) Aarakocra eggs and hatchlings are sought after by wealthy land owners who wish to use the creatures as scouts and sentries. An egg can bring as much as 10 cp in Tyr's marketplace. Tribes that have had eggs or hatchlings stolen have long memories and sometimes take revenge against the thief at a later date. Captive aarakocra join any tribe they come in contact with.</p><p>Athasian aarakocra have a natural life span of 21-30 years.</p><br clear=\"all\" style=\"clear:both; height:0;\">\r\n","images":["<img src=\"grf/ds.gif\" width=\"150\" height=\"75\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Dark Sun\" title=\"Dark Sun\" align=\"right\">","<img src=\"img/aarakath.gif\" alt=\"Aarakocra (Athas)\" title=\"Aarakocra (Athas)\" border=\"0\" width=\"300\" height=\"360\" style=\"text-align:right;\" align=\"right\">","<img src=\"grf/add2_01.gif\" width=\"200\" height=\"56\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Advanced Dungeons & Dragons 2nd Edition\">"],"setting":"Dark Sun","statblock":{"Aarakocra (Athas)":{"Activity Cycle":"Day","Alignment":"Any","Armor Class":"7","Climate/Terrain":"Deep desert","Damage/Attack":"1d3/1d3 or by weapon","Diet":"Carnivore","Frequency":"Rare","Hit Dice":"2+2","Intelligence":"Average (8-10)","Magic Resistance":"Nil","Morale":"Steady (11)","Movement":"6, Fl 36 (C)","No. Appearing":"1d10","No. of Attacks":"2","Organization":"Tribal","Size":"M (20'+ wingspan)","Special Attacks":"Nil","Special Defenses":"Nil","THAC0":"17","Treasure":"Varies","XP Value":"65"}},"title":"Aarakocra (Athas)"},"sources":["2433"],"statblock_names":[],"title":"Aarakocra (Athas)","prev_key":"zygraat","next_key":"aarakocr","monster_path":"/appendix/aarakath"}}},"pageContext":{"monster_key":"darkweav","monster_data":{"TSR":["2613"],"fullBody":"  <table cellspacing=\"0\" cellpadding=\"0\"><tr><th>Climate/Terrain:</th><td>Abyss, Limbo, Pandemonium</td></tr><tr><th>Frequency:</th><td>Very rare</td></tr><tr><th>Organization:</th><td>Solitary</td></tr><tr><th>Activity Cycle:</th><td>Night</td></tr><tr><th>Diet:</th><td>Carnivore</td></tr><tr><th>Intelligence:</th><td>Exceptional (15-16)</td></tr><tr><th>Treasure:</th><td>D</td></tr><tr><th>Alignment:</th><td>Chaotic evil</td></tr><tr><th>No. Appearing:</th><td>1</td></tr><tr><th>Armor Class:</th><td>-4 (4)</td></tr><tr><th>Movement:</th><td>9</td></tr><tr><th>Hit Dice:</th><td>6+2</td></tr><tr><th>THAC0:</th><td>15</td></tr><tr><th>No. of Attacks:</th><td>6 tentacles</td></tr><tr><th>Damage/Attack:</th><td>1d2 + Special</td></tr><tr><th>Special Attacks:</th><td>Web, magic use</td></tr><tr><th>Special Defenses:</th><td>Shadow</td></tr><tr><th>Magic Resistance:</th><td>50% (10%)</td></tr><tr><th>Size:</th><td>M (4' body, 10' tentacles)</td></tr><tr><th>Morale:</th><td>Elite (13-14)</td></tr><tr><th>XP Value:</th><td>8,000</td></tr></table><p class=\"f\">The darkweaver's a strange and frightening creature, partly real and partly shadow. It dwells in the caves and grottos of some of the chaotic planes, particularly Pandemonium. Some cutters say the thing's native to the Demiplane of Shadow, and that it settled in this corner of the planes because it found conditions in the Abyss and Pandemonium to its liking. Not many sods've ever gotten a chance to question a darkweaver about its origins, and few of these even survived the experience.</p><p>The darkweaver creates webs of gloom and shadow just like a <a href=\"/appendix/spider\">spider</a> casts webs of silk. Its snares aren't easily detected, since it prefers to air in places where daylight never comes. A darkweaver's net an stretch for miles through twisted tunnels and dank caverns, trapping luckless sds onestradat a time until they've hopelessly cpught in its shadow. In its web, the darkweaver can manipulate the thoughts and emotions of its vitims until thes willingly walk into its dark embrace.</p><p>The darkweaver's form is amorphous and menacing, gliding like black oil over a cavern wall or pooling in  places where the shadow is deepest. Folds of darkness cling to ir like a cloak or a second skin. If the darkness surrounding it can be dispelled, the darkweaver's body is revealed to be a rubbery, spherical thing with strong wiry tentacles and shorter, thicker feeding proboscises. It's said that a body'd rather meet the Lady of Pain than see a darkweaver in the light.</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Combat:</b> The darkweaver tries to lure its victims into its web of shadow, or failing that, to weaver its web around them and prevent their escape. If the darkweaver's removed from its surrounding shadows, it flees as quickly as possible. The creature can't abide the touch of bright light.</p><p>The darkweaver's web can extend for hundred of yards. The outermost strands appear to be insubstantial at first; a basher can brush his hand right through one and feel only an eerie, oily chill. Shining a light on the web makes the strands fade into mere shadows, but they don't fade right - they seem to slither away like snakes. The weaver blends the edges of its web into surrounding natural shadows perfectly; there's only a 10% chance that a character notices the outer strands beforehe enters the web. (Rangers, experienced guides, or creatures with unusual acute senses have a 30% chance to detect the darkweaver's web).</p><p>Inside the outer layers of the web, vision drops to half normal. The shadowy strads easily give way to a creature moving toward the center, but a sod trying to get out finds that the shadowy strands don't retreat from his lihgt anymore; they cling to him and prevent his escape. Any creature trying to leave the web is reduced to half its normal movement and must successfully make a saving throw vs. spell to force its way through the shadowy strands.</p><p>If a sod enters the inner part of the web (usually an area about 100 yards across), he's caught for sure. Again, he's free to move toward the web's center, but to move back out he must successfully make a saving throw vs. spell or become <i>disoriented</i> and <i>slowed</i>. No matter which way e turns, he travels deeper toward the center. Even if the character makes a successful saving throw, he's still <i>slowed</i>. The darkweaver's web is thick enough to swallow any normal light, and vision's reduced to one-quarter normal. A lantern that casts a beam 60 feet illuminates a path only 15 feet long in the inner part of the web.</p><p>At the web's center, victims must successfully save vs. spell or become held. Even if they do succeed, they are still <i>slowed</i> and can't escape the center without killing the darkweaver or dispelling its web. The darkweaver's lair is here, and the web's center is as dark as the blackness of a <i>darkness</i> spell.</p><p>If the weaver can't entice a sod into entering its web, it may try to misdirect him into a passage it can close behind him, or get ahead of him and web the path he's using. A darkweaver can create one 10' cube of gloomweb per round; if it webs the same area twice, the thickness is equal to the inner part of its web, and a third time results in webbing as thick as what lies at the center of the darkeaver's web.</p><p>Once per round, the darkweaver can use the spell-like powers of <i>confusion</i>, <i>sleep</i>, or <i>suggestion</i> with a range of 60 feet. In any area of shadow or darkness, the darkweaver can become <i>invisible</i>, create 2 to 5 <i>mirror images</i>, or <i>teleport</i> up to 200 feet to another area of shadow. In addition, the creature can create <i>shades</i>, <i>solid fog</i>, or a <i>symbol of despair</i> once per day while it's in its own web. Darkweavers communicate by means of a limited form of <i>telepathy</i> with a 60-foot range; humans and demihumans perceive the creature's thoughts as sibiliant whisperings in the shadows.</p><p>The darkweaver uses its powers to immobilize its victims before drawing them near enough to feed. If possible, it attacks physically only when its victims arehopelessly entangled in the center of its web. The weaver attacks by lashing at its victims with its tentacles for 1d2 points of damage each; if it can hit a victim with at least four tentacles, it draws near enough to insert its feeding proboscises. These automatically inflict 2d4 points of damage per round, and the victim must successfully save versus spell or permanently lose 1 point of Constitution in each round of feeding. The darkweaver's victim can fight back only by trying to break free or attacking with a Type S weapon.</p><p>A weaver's forced to release a victim it has grasped of ot takes more than 15 points of damage, if the victim succeeds in a bend bars/lift gates roll, or if the darkweaver is struck with magical <i>light</i> of some kind.</p><p>The darkweaver's vulnerable to light-based attacks. A <i>light</i> spell destroy a 10' cube of its web and inflicts 1d3 points of damage on the creature before dissipating. A <i>continual light</i> destroys 1d6 10' cubes of the creature's web, dispels its shadow protection for 1 rpund, and inflicts 1d6 points of damage. Very powerful light effects such as a <i>sunray</i> or the <i>sunburst</i> effect of a <i>wand of illumination</i> inflict 2d10 points of damage, destroy 2d6 10' cubes of the web, and dispel the darkweaver's shadow for 1d6 hours. (The Armor Class and magic resistance in parentheses note the darkweaver's defenses without its shadow protection.)</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Habitat/Society:</b> The darkweaver haunts subterranean passageways, gloomy forests, and dismal swamps throughout the Abyss, Pandemonium, and Limbo. It's also been rumored that great numbers of the creatures dwell on the Demiplane of Shadow. The darkweaver is asexual and reproduces by division, although this is a very rare occurence. A sod who runs across a darkweaver that's just divided should be aware that the young creature's a 3 HS version of its parent.</p><p>Darkeavers're diabolical creatures that use any means available to lure potential pery into their webs. When dealing with intelligent creatures, the weaver's likely to say or promise anything to get its prey to come nearer. They're clever enough to leave formidable prey such as greater tanar'ri alone, and may strike deals with more powerful neighbors. Darkweavers are patient and calculating creatures, and may let a meal go today if it means having two meals tomorrow.</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Ecology:</b> The darkweaver preys on anything that comes near its web, but has the sense to leave very tough creatures alone. If anything strong enough to kill it enters its web, the darkweaver is likely to use its powers of illusion and deceit to hide from its attacker until it's safe again. As a result, there's nothing known that makes a regular meal of a darkweaver.</p><p>Despite the weaver's alien appearance, it's a subtle creature that enjoys its mastery of suggestion and illusion. Nothing pleases a darkweaver more than tricking its foes into placing themselves at its mercy.</p><br clear=\"all\" style=\"clear:both; height:0;\">\r\n","images":["<img src=\"grf/ps.gif\" width=\"150\" height=\"75\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Planescape\" title=\"Planescape\" align=\"right\">","<img src=\"img/darkweav.gif\" alt=\"Darkweaver\" title=\"Darkweaver\" border=\"0\" width=\"300\" height=\"360\" style=\"text-align:right;\" align=\"right\">","<img src=\"grf/add2_01.gif\" width=\"200\" height=\"56\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Advanced Dungeons & Dragons 2nd Edition\">"],"setting":"Planescape","statblock":{"Darkweaver":{"Activity Cycle":"Night","Alignment":"Chaotic evil","Armor Class":"-4 (4)","Climate/Terrain":"Abyss, Limbo, Pandemonium","Damage/Attack":"1d2 + Special","Diet":"Carnivore","Frequency":"Very rare","Hit Dice":"6+2","Intelligence":"Exceptional (15-16)","Magic Resistance":"50% (10%)","Morale":"Elite (13-14)","Movement":"9","No. Appearing":"1","No. of Attacks":"6 tentacles","Organization":"Solitary","Size":"M (4' body, 10' tentacles)","Special Attacks":"Web, magic use","Special Defenses":"Shadow","THAC0":"15","Treasure":"D","XP Value":"8,000"}},"title":"Darkweaver"},"sources":["2613"],"statblock_names":[],"title":"Darkweaver","prev_key":"darktent","next_key":"darkwing","monster_path":"/appendix/darkweav"}},"staticQueryHashes":[],"slicesMap":{}}
