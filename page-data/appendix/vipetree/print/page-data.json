While the powers listed above are the most common, some aarakocra have different or additional powers.</p><p class=\"f\">A race of intelligent, birdlike creatures living in the deepest deserts of Athas, the rare Athasian <a href=\"/appendix/aarakocr\">aarakocra</a> spends its time soaring on thermals in search of food.</p><p>The aarakocra is 7 to 8 feet tall with a wingspan of 20 feet or more. Because of its large wingspan, an aarakocra can carry as much as 75% of its own body weight and still fly easily. An aarakocra can fly a short distance carrying a burden equaling 125% of its own body weight. The average body weight of a full grown male is 100 pounds and a female is 85 pounds.</p><p>Each wing has a &ldquo;hand&rdquo; at its midpoint, consisting of three fingers and an opposable thumb. The fourth finger forms the rigid leading edge of the wing. In flight the hands cannot be used, but on the ground the aarakocra can use its hands almost as a human would. The aarakocra's body is protected by a thin bony plate on the chest, much like a solid rib cage. Talons on its legs can be used as claws and can be retracted to reveal a second set of hands, also with three fingers and an opposable thumb. Except for the chest plate, the entire skeleton is hollow and extremely fragile.</p><p>From a distance, the Athasian aarakocra resembles a huge <a href=\"/appendix/bird\">vulture</a>. Its black eyes, set in the front of the head, provide excellent vision over a long range. The plumage is generally black with a white collar for adult males and black or brown with a smaller white collar for females. Adolescents are a mixture of brown and black. The beak is large and covers most of the head. Plumage begins at the crown of the head and is darker near the head, except for the collar. Athasian aarakocra speak their own language and the languages of vultures and other large birds. Some speak the common tongue (5% to 10% chance depending on how deep in the wastelands a tribe lives).</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Combat:</b> Aarakocra can fight in the air or on the ground. They prefer aerial combat since their bones are too fragile to withstand a solid blow from a human-sized opponent. In combat against creatures on the ground, they prefer to fly over their victim and drop weighted nets. Some aarakocra use darts to harass ground-based opponents.</p><p>If their opponents can fly, the aarakocra generally forgo the use of the net, although large groups sometimes use nets on flying creatures. Normally, aarakocra attack flying creatures with long spears, diving from above and allowing the momentum to carry the spear through the target. Such an attack doubles the damage if the aarakocra have been able to dive at least 50 feet. Only the very largest aarakocra can carry more than one of these spears, they can attack with both at once with no penalty, causing double damage on each strike. All diving attacks are made at +4 and should be treated as a charge attack. All other penalties and restrictions of charge attacks apply.</p><p>The effect of the aarakocra's nets depends on if the opponent is flying at the time it becomes entangled. Creatures on the ground that are hit by a net are entangled and unable to participate in any combat until they make a successful Strength check to get free of the net. Flying creatures hit by a net can no longer fly and immediately begin falling. If they cannot escape the net or use some magical means to arrest the fall, normal falling damage applies.</p><p>Unless victims are entangled in nets, aarakocra are cautious in ground combat. If the aarakocra outnumber their opponents they advance in a straight line and thrust with their spears. If outnumbered, or the opponents are particularly tough, the aarakocra withdraw. Victims entangled in nets are killed or incapacitated for use as food or ransom.</p><p>Athasian aarakocra are mindful of their physical limitations as well as their comparatively low psionic abilities. They do not normally initiate psionic combat. At the first sign of psionic powers from any of their victims, however, all aarakocra that have some ability will use whatever attack and defense modes they can in an attempt to destroy the threat. Large groups of is or more aarakocra may initiate psionic combat if their leaders feel they can win quickly and avoid physical combat.</p><p>In desperation, an aarakocra can attempt to bite an opponent in combat. Because of the unwieldiness of its beak, the aarakocra has a THAC0 of 18 if attacking with this appendage. Further, the birdman causes only 1d2 points of damage with the beak.</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Habitat/Society:</b> Athasian aarakocra live in tribes with 6-20 (2d8+4) members, depending on the prestige of the leader. The largest tribe ever recorded had 50 members. The tribal hunting territory depends on the size of the tribe, usually about 500 square miles for a tribe of 10 members. There are no rigid boundaries between tribes and border disputes are not uncommon.</p><p>Alignments of tribe members are similar to the alignment of the leader. A tribe that has a leader who is neutral good may have neutral good, chaotic good, lawful good, and true neutral members. A predominantly evil tribe does not recognize boundaries with other tribes and treats other tribes as inferior beings to be eliminated.</p><p>Athasian aarakocra aren't happy in enclosed spaces, but they they take refuge in a cave or building if necessary.</p><p>Nonevil tribes live in rocky aeries in the highest peaks they can find. Evil tribes are normally nomadic and use an aerie made by another tribe if they need to remain in an area for a long time, even if they have to evict the tribe that made the nest.</p><p>Aarakocra aren't friendly toward intruders in their territory, especially caravans. They try to extract a toll from the caravan for passage through the desert. Good-aligned tribes allow unhindered passage of caravans that pay a tribute. If someone refuses to pay the tribute, the aarakocra try to capture scouts or outriders from the party and hold them until an even larger tribute is paid. The payment may be either livestock or shiny objects. Aarakocra are smart enough not to be taken in by glass baubles instead of gems, although they cannot tell the difference between the more common gems and the rare ones.</p><p>Evil tribes ask for tribute and often attack a caravan whether it pays or not. Aarakocra always demand shiny objects such as stones. These tribes find humans and demihumans to be quite tasty and prefer them to other food.</p><p>Good-aligned tribes of aarakocra sometimes return a lost traveler to the edge of the desert after first removing any valuables the traveler may be carrying. On very rare occasions a tribe might return a lost group of travelers to the more frequently traveled parts of the desert, again after first taking any valuables as payment.</p><p>The oldest male is the leader of the tribal hunting party and has 4+4 Hit Dice. The oldest female is in charge of the tribal aerie and has 3+3 HD. In tribes that have more than 15 members, the next oldest aarakocra serves as shaman and has 3+3 HD; the shaman completes the triumvirate necessary for proper worship and the summoning of elementals. (Interestingly, no magic-using aarakocra has ever been recorded.) Tribes without a shaman cannot summon <a href=\"/appendix/element1\">air elementals</a>, which is an important part of aarakocra culture.</p><p>The shaman is the leader of the daily sun worship. Aarakocra worship the sun because it provides them with the thermals they need to soar in search of food. The shaman also leads the mystic rituals used to summon an air elemental. Summoning an air elemental is usually done only in preparation for the tribe's most sacred ceremony, the hunt. Small tribes must band together for this ceremony to allow the triumvirate to be formed.</p><p>The ceremony to summon an air elemental must be conducted at dawn and requires the oldest male and female to emit a highpitched keening whistle. The shaman conducts an intricate dance around them, simultaneously chanting an ancient summoning mantra.</p><p>The hunt is the final part of the initiation of adolescent aarakocra to adulthood and often takes the tribe far from their normal teritory. The target is always a <a href=\"/appendix/drakalsi\">silt drake</a>. The hunt is the only time the females leave the relative safety of the nest. Even an evil tribe will not interfere with a tribe on a hunt. An air elemental is often summoned to help find the drake, but never takes part in the actual combat. Although the adult members of the tribe take part in the initial phases of the combat, it is the initiates who deliver the final, killing blows to me drake. Scars from the hunt are considered a mark of pride among all aarakocra.</p><p>The females spend about eight months of the year incubating their eggs. Athasian aarakocra mate for life and a pair normally produces as many as 10 offspring. A female lays one egg a year. Constant incubation is not required because of the high daytime temperatures, so the females can maintain the nest and keep the tribe's treasure in order.</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Ecology:</b> Athasian aarakocra are high on the food chain and have no natural enemies other than <a href=\"/appendix/drakatha\">drakes</a>. Unless evil, aarakocra leave their own territory only to hunt the silt drake and return as soon as possible when the hunt is over. (Evil aarakocra attack others, as noted above.) Aarakocra eggs and hatchlings are sought after by wealthy land owners who wish to use the creatures as scouts and sentries. An egg can bring as much as 10 cp in Tyr's marketplace. Tribes that have had eggs or hatchlings stolen have long memories and sometimes take revenge against the thief at a later date. Captive aarakocra join any tribe they come in contact with.</p><p>Athasian aarakocra have a natural life span of 21-30 years.</p><br clear=\"all\" style=\"clear:both; height:0;\">\r\n","images":["<img src=\"grf/ds.gif\" width=\"150\" height=\"75\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Dark Sun\" title=\"Dark Sun\" align=\"right\">","<img src=\"img/aarakath.gif\" alt=\"Aarakocra (Athas)\" title=\"Aarakocra (Athas)\" border=\"0\" width=\"300\" height=\"360\" style=\"text-align:right;\" align=\"right\">","<img src=\"grf/add2_01.gif\" width=\"200\" height=\"56\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Advanced Dungeons & Dragons 2nd Edition\">"],"setting":"Dark Sun","statblock":{"Aarakocra (Athas)":{"Activity Cycle":"Day","Alignment":"Any","Armor Class":"7","Climate/Terrain":"Deep desert","Damage/Attack":"1d3/1d3 or by weapon","Diet":"Carnivore","Frequency":"Rare","Hit Dice":"2+2","Intelligence":"Average (8-10)","Magic Resistance":"Nil","Morale":"Steady (11)","Movement":"6, Fl 36 (C)","No. Appearing":"1d10","No. of Attacks":"2","Organization":"Tribal","Size":"M (20'+ wingspan)","Special Attacks":"Nil","Special Defenses":"Nil","THAC0":"17","Treasure":"Varies","XP Value":"65"}},"title":"Aarakocra (Athas)"},"sources":["2433"],"statblock_names":[],"title":"Aarakocra (Athas)","prev_key":"zygraat","next_key":"aarakocr","monster_path":"/appendix/aarakath"}}},"pageContext":{"monster_key":"vipetree","monster_data":{"TSR":["2603","9574"],"fullBody":"  <table cellspacing=\"0\" cellpadding=\"0\"><tr><th>Climate/Terrain:</th><td>Abyss, Carceri, Gray Wastes</td></tr><tr><th>Frequency:</th><td>Rare</td></tr><tr><th>Organization:</th><td>Solitary</td></tr><tr><th>Activity Cycle:</th><td>Any</td></tr><tr><th>Diet:</th><td>Omnivore</td></tr><tr><th>Intelligence:</th><td>Semi to low (2-7)</td></tr><tr><th>Treasure:</th><td>L,M,O (R,W)</td></tr><tr><th>Alignment:</th><td>Chaotic evil or neutral evil</td></tr><tr><th>No. Appearing:</th><td>1d20</td></tr><tr><th>Armor Class:</th><td>7</td></tr><tr><th>Movement:</th><td>0, 15 in larval form</td></tr><tr><th>Hit Dice:</th><td>2-9</td></tr><tr><th>THAC0:</th><td>2 HD: 19<br>3-4 HD: 17<br>5-6 HD: 15<br>7-8 HD: 13<br>9 HD: 11</td></tr><tr><th>No. of Attacks:</th><td>1 per HD</td></tr><tr><th>Damage/Attack:</th><td>2d6</td></tr><tr><th>Special Attacks:</th><td>Venom</td></tr><tr><th>Special Defenses:</th><td>Spells, immunities</td></tr><tr><th>Magic Resistance:</th><td>15%</td></tr><tr><th>Size:</th><td>L-H (5-50' tall)</td></tr><tr><th>Morale:</th><td>Steady (11-12)</td></tr><tr><th>XP Value:</th><td>2 HD: 420<br>3 HD: 975<br>4 HD: 2,000<br>5 HD: 3,000<br>6 HD: 4,000<br>7 HD: 5,000<br>8 HD: 6,000<br>9 HD: 7,000</td></tr></table><p class=\"f\">Said to be the bastard young of Nidhogg, the <a href=\"/appendix/snake\">serpent</a> at the root of Yggdrasil, viper trees are white, scaly trees with living snakes' heads as their branches. From a distance they appear as white beeches or similar trees, but viewed up close they have clearly reptilian skin and features. Though they can writhe and reach as snakes do, usually viper trees simply sway in the breeze as other trees - but they also move even in the absence of any breeze.</p><p>Viper trees speak the language of <a href=\"/appendix/tanarri\">tanar'ri</a> and no other. Groves of viper trees hiss and whisper to each other unnervingly during the night, speaking or their kills, their hungers, and their treasures. They are common in Azzagrat, the 45th to 47th layers of the Abyss; elsewhere in the Abyss they are used as guards in gardens, around moats, and at gates.</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Combat:</b> Single viper trees rarely attack creatures larger than size S. Viper tree groves (such as the Viper Forest of Zrintor) are notably more aggressive, willing to attack small groups or size M creatures if the group is perceived as sufficiently weak. They can swallow even size L creatures, if given enough time.</p><p>A viper tree has dozens of serpentlike heads and branches, but the tree can only command a few of them at a time. When a branch is slain, one of the tree's &ldquo;sleeping&rdquo; branches wakes, for the brain of a viper tree is actually deep in the tree's heartwood. As a result viper trees get their full complement or attacks until they are near death. The bite of a viper tree inflicts 2d6 points of damage.</p><p>Viper tree venom is insidious and potent; anyone bitten by a viper tree must make a saving throw against poison at -3. Victims that fail lose 4 points of Dexterity permanently and are immobilized by the venom for 48 hours, long enough for the tree to swallow even the largest prey. The venom has an onset time of 2d4 rounds. Even if the saving throw succeeds, the victim temporarily loses 4 points of Dexterity as a result of the shakes and trembling the venom induces for the next 48 hours. <i>Neutralize poison</i> removes the dexterity loss immediately, but does nothing for the paralysis. It even prevents the permanent Dexterity loss if applied within an hour. <i>Remove paralysis</i> cures the twitching and immobility, but does nothing for the Dexterity loss. Viper trees are immune to their own venom.</p><p>Because of their multiple heads, viper trees are unaffected by most spells that target a single or a few creatures, such as <i>charm monster</i>, <i>hold person</i>, or <i>sleep</i>. To affect a viper tree, such a spell must affect a number or creatures equal to the viper tree's Hit Dice.</p><p>Viper trees are immune to cold, venom, and acid attacks, and they take half damage from blunt weapons and normal damage from electrical attacks. Their woody stumps bleed a brownish-amber sap when cut, and the wood burns quickly. Viper trees suffer double damage from fire.</p><p>If attacked with missile weapons, viper trees can break off their own branches to crawl toward their attackers. These branches ooze sap from their broken end and die within an hour, so the trees are reluctant to lose them, but the broken branches have the same hit points, THAC0, and damage as the parent tree.</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Habitat/Society:</b> Viper trees are a strange hybrid of tanar'ri, reptile, and plant, a sort of fiendish, egg-laying plant. Theyy lay eggs once a month, and each egg lies protected at the base of its parent. Once it hatches on its own, the newly hatched viper tree is abandoned by its parent. The young go through a mobile stage before rooting in the body of their first large prey.</p><p>Great groves of viper trees grow on the sites of some Blood War battlefields, where the trees defend themselves against attacks from <a href=\"/appendix/baatezu\">baatezu</a> by growing in large clusters. The viper trees allow tanar'ri armies to pass through freely and even take cover under their branches, but baatezu are always attacked, even if all the viper trees are slain as a result. <a href=\"/appendix/yugoloth\">Yugoloth</a> armies are usually ignored.</p><p>A legend exists among the tanar'ri that the lords of Baator once amused themselves by forming viper trees from manes and other creatures that they captured in the Blood War. Others say that the Abyssal lords made examples of a thousand least tanar'ri who refused to march against a position that a million of their fellows had already failed to lake. In either case, they were once tanar'ri, and this is why they usually side with the tanar'ri against the baatezu. The tanar'ri still tell the tale to prevent desertions, but it may hold a kernel of truth to it: Some baatezu lords are believed to still know the secret to the transformation.</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Ecology:</b> According to a Harmonium poll designed to discover ideal carnivorous plant preferences (involving 47 viper trees in three separate groves), the tastiest forms of prey are &ldquo;small, easy to swallow, like squirrels - they tickle bark,&rdquo; followed by anything else seeking shelter (&ldquo;they're so funny when they're scared), <a href=\"/appendix/eyewing\">eyewings</a> (&ldquo;gooey&rdquo;), and last by small flying creatures that mistakenly nest in their branches (&ldquo;too many feathers, except <a href=\"/appendix/bat\">bats</a>&rdquo;). Large viper trees also eat &ldquo;walkers&rdquo; - <a href=\"/appendix/tanaladr\">dretch</a>, <a href=\"/appendix/baatlemu\">lemures</a>, <a href=\"/appendix/tanalama\">manes</a>, <a href=\"/appendix/baatnupp\">nupperibo</a>, <a href=\"/appendix/tanalaru\">rutterkin</a>, and other weak, marginally moronic deserters who haunt the battlefields of the Blood War in droves - but they claim that &ldquo;walkers sting, and taste like fear.&rdquo; In lean times, 4 out of 5 viper trees claim that they can survive on a form of magical sustenance (&ldquo;eat spells&rdquo;), the waters of the Styx (&ldquo;forgot what it tastes like, but so sleepy&rdquo;), and the nutrients in the blood-soaked battlefields of the Blood War (&ldquo;red dirt is good&rdquo;). Only 1 in 10 viper trees was able to overwhelm a Harmonium questioner.</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Larval Form</b></p>  <p class=\"ni\">In their larval form, viper trees resemble fully mobile, three-headed snakes. Larval trees have only 2 Hit Dice, and only two of the heads of the newly hatched creature are fully active - the third is a sort of runt. The tiny, inactive head is always the central one, which is carried along by the other two until it awakens after a period of about one month. Thereafter the third head is the directing intelligence of the entire creature, and it begins searching for a suitable place to put down roots. When the larval tree kills suitably large prey, it lodges its tail through the kill and into the earth and begins the growth or its plant phase.</p><p>The larval viper tree is insatiably hungry, constantly devouring manes, <a href=\"/appendix/cranirat\">cranium rats</a>, and other small prey. It can strike a single target with two heads, while the third protects it against attacks from any other direction. Its venom immobilizes prey by inducing twitching spasms that last for 1d10 hours (a saving throw versus poison at +2 reduces this to a 2-point Dexterity loss, which fades within a day).</p><p></p><br clear=\"all\" style=\"clear:both; height:0;\">\r\n","images":["<img src=\"grf/ps.gif\" width=\"150\" height=\"75\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Planescape\" title=\"Planescape\" align=\"right\">","<img src=\"img/vipetree.gif\" alt=\"Viper Tree\" title=\"Viper Tree\" border=\"0\" width=\"300\" height=\"360\" style=\"text-align:right;\" align=\"right\">","<img src=\"grf/add2_01.gif\" width=\"200\" height=\"56\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Advanced Dungeons & Dragons 2nd Edition\">"],"setting":"Planescape","statblock":{"Viper Tree":{"Activity Cycle":"Any","Alignment":"Chaotic evil or neutral evil","Armor Class":"7","Climate/Terrain":"Abyss, Carceri, Gray Wastes","Damage/Attack":"2d6","Diet":"Omnivore","Frequency":"Rare","Hit Dice":"2-9","Intelligence":"Semi to low (2-7)","Magic Resistance":"15%","Morale":"Steady (11-12)","Movement":"0, 15 in larval form","No. Appearing":"1d20","No. of Attacks":"1 per HD","Organization":"Solitary","Size":"L-H (5-50' tall)","Special Attacks":"Venom","Special Defenses":"Spells, immunities","THAC0":"2 HD: 19<br>3-4 HD: 17<br>5-6 HD: 15<br>7-8 HD: 13<br>9 HD: 11","Treasure":"L,M,O (R,W)","XP Value":"2 HD: 420<br>3 HD: 975<br>4 HD: 2,000<br>5 HD: 3,000<br>6 HD: 4,000<br>7 HD: 5,000<br>8 HD: 6,000<br>9 HD: 7,000"}},"title":"Viper Tree"},"sources":["2603","9574"],"statblock_names":[],"title":"Viper Tree","prev_key":"vineinfi","next_key":"virus","monster_path":"/appendix/vipetree"}},"staticQueryHashes":[],"slicesMap":{}}
