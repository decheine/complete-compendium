While the powers listed above are the most common, some aarakocra have different or additional powers.</p><p class=\"f\">A race of intelligent, birdlike creatures living in the deepest deserts of Athas, the rare Athasian <a href=\"/appendix/aarakocr\">aarakocra</a> spends its time soaring on thermals in search of food.</p><p>The aarakocra is 7 to 8 feet tall with a wingspan of 20 feet or more. Because of its large wingspan, an aarakocra can carry as much as 75% of its own body weight and still fly easily. An aarakocra can fly a short distance carrying a burden equaling 125% of its own body weight. The average body weight of a full grown male is 100 pounds and a female is 85 pounds.</p><p>Each wing has a &ldquo;hand&rdquo; at its midpoint, consisting of three fingers and an opposable thumb. The fourth finger forms the rigid leading edge of the wing. In flight the hands cannot be used, but on the ground the aarakocra can use its hands almost as a human would. The aarakocra's body is protected by a thin bony plate on the chest, much like a solid rib cage. Talons on its legs can be used as claws and can be retracted to reveal a second set of hands, also with three fingers and an opposable thumb. Except for the chest plate, the entire skeleton is hollow and extremely fragile.</p><p>From a distance, the Athasian aarakocra resembles a huge <a href=\"/appendix/bird\">vulture</a>. Its black eyes, set in the front of the head, provide excellent vision over a long range. The plumage is generally black with a white collar for adult males and black or brown with a smaller white collar for females. Adolescents are a mixture of brown and black. The beak is large and covers most of the head. Plumage begins at the crown of the head and is darker near the head, except for the collar. Athasian aarakocra speak their own language and the languages of vultures and other large birds. Some speak the common tongue (5% to 10% chance depending on how deep in the wastelands a tribe lives).</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Combat:</b> Aarakocra can fight in the air or on the ground. They prefer aerial combat since their bones are too fragile to withstand a solid blow from a human-sized opponent. In combat against creatures on the ground, they prefer to fly over their victim and drop weighted nets. Some aarakocra use darts to harass ground-based opponents.</p><p>If their opponents can fly, the aarakocra generally forgo the use of the net, although large groups sometimes use nets on flying creatures. Normally, aarakocra attack flying creatures with long spears, diving from above and allowing the momentum to carry the spear through the target. Such an attack doubles the damage if the aarakocra have been able to dive at least 50 feet. Only the very largest aarakocra can carry more than one of these spears, they can attack with both at once with no penalty, causing double damage on each strike. All diving attacks are made at +4 and should be treated as a charge attack. All other penalties and restrictions of charge attacks apply.</p><p>The effect of the aarakocra's nets depends on if the opponent is flying at the time it becomes entangled. Creatures on the ground that are hit by a net are entangled and unable to participate in any combat until they make a successful Strength check to get free of the net. Flying creatures hit by a net can no longer fly and immediately begin falling. If they cannot escape the net or use some magical means to arrest the fall, normal falling damage applies.</p><p>Unless victims are entangled in nets, aarakocra are cautious in ground combat. If the aarakocra outnumber their opponents they advance in a straight line and thrust with their spears. If outnumbered, or the opponents are particularly tough, the aarakocra withdraw. Victims entangled in nets are killed or incapacitated for use as food or ransom.</p><p>Athasian aarakocra are mindful of their physical limitations as well as their comparatively low psionic abilities. They do not normally initiate psionic combat. At the first sign of psionic powers from any of their victims, however, all aarakocra that have some ability will use whatever attack and defense modes they can in an attempt to destroy the threat. Large groups of is or more aarakocra may initiate psionic combat if their leaders feel they can win quickly and avoid physical combat.</p><p>In desperation, an aarakocra can attempt to bite an opponent in combat. Because of the unwieldiness of its beak, the aarakocra has a THAC0 of 18 if attacking with this appendage. Further, the birdman causes only 1d2 points of damage with the beak.</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Habitat/Society:</b> Athasian aarakocra live in tribes with 6-20 (2d8+4) members, depending on the prestige of the leader. The largest tribe ever recorded had 50 members. The tribal hunting territory depends on the size of the tribe, usually about 500 square miles for a tribe of 10 members. There are no rigid boundaries between tribes and border disputes are not uncommon.</p><p>Alignments of tribe members are similar to the alignment of the leader. A tribe that has a leader who is neutral good may have neutral good, chaotic good, lawful good, and true neutral members. A predominantly evil tribe does not recognize boundaries with other tribes and treats other tribes as inferior beings to be eliminated.</p><p>Athasian aarakocra aren't happy in enclosed spaces, but they they take refuge in a cave or building if necessary.</p><p>Nonevil tribes live in rocky aeries in the highest peaks they can find. Evil tribes are normally nomadic and use an aerie made by another tribe if they need to remain in an area for a long time, even if they have to evict the tribe that made the nest.</p><p>Aarakocra aren't friendly toward intruders in their territory, especially caravans. They try to extract a toll from the caravan for passage through the desert. Good-aligned tribes allow unhindered passage of caravans that pay a tribute. If someone refuses to pay the tribute, the aarakocra try to capture scouts or outriders from the party and hold them until an even larger tribute is paid. The payment may be either livestock or shiny objects. Aarakocra are smart enough not to be taken in by glass baubles instead of gems, although they cannot tell the difference between the more common gems and the rare ones.</p><p>Evil tribes ask for tribute and often attack a caravan whether it pays or not. Aarakocra always demand shiny objects such as stones. These tribes find humans and demihumans to be quite tasty and prefer them to other food.</p><p>Good-aligned tribes of aarakocra sometimes return a lost traveler to the edge of the desert after first removing any valuables the traveler may be carrying. On very rare occasions a tribe might return a lost group of travelers to the more frequently traveled parts of the desert, again after first taking any valuables as payment.</p><p>The oldest male is the leader of the tribal hunting party and has 4+4 Hit Dice. The oldest female is in charge of the tribal aerie and has 3+3 HD. In tribes that have more than 15 members, the next oldest aarakocra serves as shaman and has 3+3 HD; the shaman completes the triumvirate necessary for proper worship and the summoning of elementals. (Interestingly, no magic-using aarakocra has ever been recorded.) Tribes without a shaman cannot summon <a href=\"/appendix/element1\">air elementals</a>, which is an important part of aarakocra culture.</p><p>The shaman is the leader of the daily sun worship. Aarakocra worship the sun because it provides them with the thermals they need to soar in search of food. The shaman also leads the mystic rituals used to summon an air elemental. Summoning an air elemental is usually done only in preparation for the tribe's most sacred ceremony, the hunt. Small tribes must band together for this ceremony to allow the triumvirate to be formed.</p><p>The ceremony to summon an air elemental must be conducted at dawn and requires the oldest male and female to emit a highpitched keening whistle. The shaman conducts an intricate dance around them, simultaneously chanting an ancient summoning mantra.</p><p>The hunt is the final part of the initiation of adolescent aarakocra to adulthood and often takes the tribe far from their normal teritory. The target is always a <a href=\"/appendix/drakalsi\">silt drake</a>. The hunt is the only time the females leave the relative safety of the nest. Even an evil tribe will not interfere with a tribe on a hunt. An air elemental is often summoned to help find the drake, but never takes part in the actual combat. Although the adult members of the tribe take part in the initial phases of the combat, it is the initiates who deliver the final, killing blows to me drake. Scars from the hunt are considered a mark of pride among all aarakocra.</p><p>The females spend about eight months of the year incubating their eggs. Athasian aarakocra mate for life and a pair normally produces as many as 10 offspring. A female lays one egg a year. Constant incubation is not required because of the high daytime temperatures, so the females can maintain the nest and keep the tribe's treasure in order.</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Ecology:</b> Athasian aarakocra are high on the food chain and have no natural enemies other than <a href=\"/appendix/drakatha\">drakes</a>. Unless evil, aarakocra leave their own territory only to hunt the silt drake and return as soon as possible when the hunt is over. (Evil aarakocra attack others, as noted above.) Aarakocra eggs and hatchlings are sought after by wealthy land owners who wish to use the creatures as scouts and sentries. An egg can bring as much as 10 cp in Tyr's marketplace. Tribes that have had eggs or hatchlings stolen have long memories and sometimes take revenge against the thief at a later date. Captive aarakocra join any tribe they come in contact with.</p><p>Athasian aarakocra have a natural life span of 21-30 years.</p><p></p><br clear=\"all\" style=\"clear:both; height:0;\">\r\n","images":["<img src=\"grf/ds.gif\" width=\"150\" height=\"75\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Dark Sun\" title=\"Dark Sun\" align=\"right\">","<img src=\"img/aarakath.gif\" alt=\"Aarakocra (Athas)\" title=\"Aarakocra (Athas)\" border=\"0\" width=\"300\" height=\"360\" style=\"text-align:right;\" align=\"right\">","<img src=\"grf/add2_01.gif\" width=\"200\" height=\"56\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Advanced Dungeons & Dragons 2nd Edition\">"],"setting":"Dark Sun","statblock":{"Aarakocra (Athas)":{"Activity Cycle":"Day","Alignment":"Any","Armor Class":"7","Climate/Terrain":"Deep desert","Damage/Attack":"1d3/1d3 or by weapon","Diet":"Carnivore","Frequency":"Rare","Hit Dice":"2+2","Intelligence":"Average (8-10)","Magic Resistance":"Nil","Morale":"Steady (11)","Movement":"6, Fl 36 (C)","No. Appearing":"1d10","No. of Attacks":"2","Organization":"Tribal","Size":"M (20'+ wingspan)","Special Attacks":"Nil","Special Defenses":"Nil","THAC0":"17","Treasure":"Varies","XP Value":"65"}},"title":"Aarakocra (Athas)"},"sources":["2433"],"statblock_names":[],"title":"Aarakocra (Athas)","prev_key":"zygraat","next_key":"aarakocr","monster_path":"/appendix/aarakath"}}},"pageContext":{"monster_key":"quesar","monster_data":{"TSR":["2615"],"fullBody":"  <table cellspacing=\"0\" cellpadding=\"0\"><tr><th>Climate/Terrain:</th><td>Elysium</td></tr><tr><th>Frequency:</th><td>Very rare</td></tr><tr><th>Organization:</th><td>Solitary</td></tr><tr><th>Activity Cycle:</th><td>Day</td></tr><tr><th>Diet:</th><td>Daylight</td></tr><tr><th>Intelligence:</th><td>Average (8-10)</td></tr><tr><th>Treasure:</th><td>Nil</td></tr><tr><th>Alignment:</th><td>Neutral good</td></tr><tr><th>No. Appearing:</th><td>1d6</td></tr><tr><th>Armor Class:</th><td>0</td></tr><tr><th>Movement:</th><td>24</td></tr><tr><th>Hit Dice:</th><td>8</td></tr><tr><th>THAC0:</th><td>13</td></tr><tr><th>No. of Attacks:</th><td>1</td></tr><tr><th>Damage/Attack:</th><td>1d12</td></tr><tr><th>Special Attacks:</th><td>Blinding, burning, and disintegration</td></tr><tr><th>Special Defenses:</th><td>+3 or better weapon to hit, immune to fire and lightning, regeneration</td></tr><tr><th>Magic Resistance:</th><td>50%</td></tr><tr><th>Size:</th><td>M (6' tall)</td></tr><tr><th>Morale:</th><td>Average (8-10)</td></tr><tr><th>XP Value:</th><td>6,000</td></tr></table><p class=\"f\">Quasar, it is said, were created by a group of lawful <a href=\"/appendix/aasimon\">aasimon</a> to serve as guardians over celestial treasures. These aasimon went to the radiant plains of Elysium and into the layer known as Belierin. There, they formed from the marshy mud a dried husk of human shape and form. In a hidden fortress called Nillis-thur, the aasimon magically transformed this mannequin so that it would absorb its energy from daylight. The fires of the construct began deep within it, but they quickly blossomed forth in cascades of might.</p><p>Soon the creation was more essence than form. The aasimon named the fruit of their labor a <i>quesar</i>, which meant &ldquo;borrowed from heaven's crown&rdquo;. They were so enamored with themselves and their ingenuity that they immediately began creating more of the quesar.</p><p>Things continued at an ever-incrcasing pace until the aasimon began to assign their creations tasks to accomplish. In the beginning, the quasar carried out the missions they were given out of a feeling of gratitude or respect for their creators. It did not take long, however, for the quesar to decide for themselves that they had no intention of being slaves or servants of any other creature. The newly formed creatures attempted to relate this concept to their creators peacefully, but the aasimon did not react well to the news that all of their labor was for naught.</p><p>The quesar thanked the aasimon for their existence and assured them that they had not worked in vain, for the energy constructs would be a powerful force for good even if they did not work directly for the aasimon. Still, the champions of the Upper Planes did not take kindly to their creations acting in such a manner. &ldquo;The clockworks do not tell the clock maker what to do. The clay does not instruct the sculptor,&rdquo; they said.</p><p>So there was war in heaven, but it was a short conflict, for some of the powers that called Elysium home intervened. &ldquo;The quesar are not creatures of order - they follow the commands of no one. That is the way of Elysium,&rdquo; they said to the aasimon. Then the powers turned to the quesar. &ldquo;You do not strike out at those who have treated you well. Creatures such as you do not act of rash thoughts and chaos. That is the way of Elysium.&rdquo;</p><p>Wordlessly, the aasimon left the marshes of Belierin. The quesar remained, to make a home for themselves and ponder the true purpose of their new lives. Most remain hidden until such meaning is found.</p><p>A quasar is vaguely human in shape, with two graceful arms, powerful legs, and a noble head joined by a slender torso. This form is obscured by the incredible amounts of energy radiating from the creature. Almost <a href=\"/appendix/golem\">golem</a>like in nature, the quesar are nonetheless free-thinking beings with the energy, power, and life span of a star.</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Combat:</b> There is one word of advice that those evil beings knowing anything about quesar give in regards to meeting them in battle: &ldquo;Don't.&rdquo; Although they never use weapons (for even those of powerful enchantment would eventually melt or dissolve in their hands), their potent strikes inflict 1d12 points of damage.</p><p>The truly terrifying might of a quesar is displayed in its energy halo which emanates forth from its corporeal form. At its lowest intensity, which can be generated by a quasar at will, all within 100 yards must make a saving throw versus spells or be blinded for 1d10 rounds. It should be noted that this energy is equivalent to sunlight for purposes of battling certain evil or undead creatures. After one round of blinding light, the intensity can be increased to a level which sears all creatures within 10 yards, inflicting 6d6 points of damage (a saving throw versus breath weapon reduces this damage by half). This attack can be used six times each day. After a round of searing power, the intensity ran be increased further. In this case, the light and force become so great that everything within 5 yards must save versus death magic or be disintegrated. This fearsome power is usable only three times each day.</p><p>Only magical weapons of +3 or greater enchantment can harm quesar. They are immune to energy-based attacks such as fire, lighting, and <i>magic missiles</i>. Cold, however, inflicts normal damage upon the constructs, assuming their magic resistance can be overcome. These beings of energy regenerate 1 hp per round while in daylight, even after they have been &ldquo;slain&rdquo;. There are only two ways to kill a quesar permanently. The first is to defeat it in battle and then place the creature's remains in darkness where the light of day never reaches. The second method requires the virtual obliteration of the creature by magical means, such as <i>disintegration</i>, multiple <i>energy drains</i>, or <i>wish</i>.</p><p>Quesar cannot be summoned, and greatly resent being controlled or forced into submission. As the archmage Tessis Ro'lariv said, &ldquo;Sometimes righteous wrath can be as horrible as evil's vengeance.&rdquo;</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Habitat/Society:</b> In many ways, the quasar are outcasts and enigmas in the Upper Planes. While they are creatures of goodness, kindness, and light, the aasimon and other lawful beings of the good planes resent their insolence and resistance to accepting the hierarchy of the heavens. On the planes of goodness, the aasimon are to be obeyed without question. Those that do not adhere to that stricture are not well liked.</p><p>Therefore, even when their might would make them useful allies in some conflict against evil waged by <a href=\"/appendix/aasideva\">devas</a>, <a href=\"/appendix/aasiplan\">planetars</a>, or even <a href=\"/appendix/asuras\">asuras</a>, the quasar are not approached for aid. They are never found in the company of other such beings. A select few have chosen paths of action for themselves, but most remain on Elysium still searching for a purpose. Rare quesar may decide to single-handedly attack the fiends in the Lower Planes. The battles that result are often spectacular displays of power in which many <a href=\"/appendix/tanarri\">tanar'ri</a>, <a href=\"/appendix/baatezu\">baatezu</a>, <a href=\"/appendix/yugoloth\">yugoloths</a>, or other evil creatures are laid low. Despise the quesar's great power, however, these attacks are suicidal. Even their might cannot stand alone against the hosts of all evil for very long.</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Ecology:</b> Quesar absorb daylight's healing power through their fragile flesh. Without this energy, they are humanoid creatures of simple appearance and delicate construction. If they are slain and this form is destroyed, even if their remains are scattered to the mercies of the four winds, the power of the sun (or whatever generates daylight on the plane they are on) rejuvenates and regenerates them. In most other respects the quesar are similar to golems, constructs without need of food, air, or water.</p><p></p><br clear=\"all\" style=\"clear:both; height:0;\">\r\n","images":["<img src=\"grf/ps.gif\" width=\"150\" height=\"75\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Planescape\" title=\"Planescape\" align=\"right\">","<img src=\"img/quesar.gif\" alt=\"Quesar\" title=\"Quesar\" border=\"0\" width=\"300\" height=\"360\" style=\"text-align:right;\" align=\"right\">","<img src=\"grf/add2_01.gif\" width=\"200\" height=\"56\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Advanced Dungeons & Dragons 2nd Edition\">"],"setting":"Planescape","statblock":{"Quesar":{"Activity Cycle":"Day","Alignment":"Neutral good","Armor Class":"0","Climate/Terrain":"Elysium","Damage/Attack":"1d12","Diet":"Daylight","Frequency":"Very rare","Hit Dice":"8","Intelligence":"Average (8-10)","Magic Resistance":"50%","Morale":"Average (8-10)","Movement":"24","No. Appearing":"1d6","No. of Attacks":"1","Organization":"Solitary","Size":"M (6' tall)","Special Attacks":"Blinding, burning, and disintegration","Special Defenses":"+3 or better weapon to hit, immune to fire and lightning, regeneration","THAC0":"13","Treasure":"Nil","XP Value":"6,000"}},"title":"Quesar"},"sources":["2615"],"statblock_names":[],"title":"Quesar","prev_key":"queofcha","next_key":"quevari","monster_path":"/appendix/quesar"}},"staticQueryHashes":[],"slicesMap":{}}
