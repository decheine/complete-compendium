While the powers listed above are the most common, some aarakocra have different or additional powers.</p><p class=\"f\">A race of intelligent, birdlike creatures living in the deepest deserts of Athas, the rare Athasian <a href=\"/appendix/aarakocr\">aarakocra</a> spends its time soaring on thermals in search of food.</p><p>The aarakocra is 7 to 8 feet tall with a wingspan of 20 feet or more. Because of its large wingspan, an aarakocra can carry as much as 75% of its own body weight and still fly easily. An aarakocra can fly a short distance carrying a burden equaling 125% of its own body weight. The average body weight of a full grown male is 100 pounds and a female is 85 pounds.</p><p>Each wing has a &ldquo;hand&rdquo; at its midpoint, consisting of three fingers and an opposable thumb. The fourth finger forms the rigid leading edge of the wing. In flight the hands cannot be used, but on the ground the aarakocra can use its hands almost as a human would. The aarakocra's body is protected by a thin bony plate on the chest, much like a solid rib cage. Talons on its legs can be used as claws and can be retracted to reveal a second set of hands, also with three fingers and an opposable thumb. Except for the chest plate, the entire skeleton is hollow and extremely fragile.</p><p>From a distance, the Athasian aarakocra resembles a huge <a href=\"/appendix/bird\">vulture</a>. Its black eyes, set in the front of the head, provide excellent vision over a long range. The plumage is generally black with a white collar for adult males and black or brown with a smaller white collar for females. Adolescents are a mixture of brown and black. The beak is large and covers most of the head. Plumage begins at the crown of the head and is darker near the head, except for the collar. Athasian aarakocra speak their own language and the languages of vultures and other large birds. Some speak the common tongue (5% to 10% chance depending on how deep in the wastelands a tribe lives).</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Combat:</b> Aarakocra can fight in the air or on the ground. They prefer aerial combat since their bones are too fragile to withstand a solid blow from a human-sized opponent. In combat against creatures on the ground, they prefer to fly over their victim and drop weighted nets. Some aarakocra use darts to harass ground-based opponents.</p><p>If their opponents can fly, the aarakocra generally forgo the use of the net, although large groups sometimes use nets on flying creatures. Normally, aarakocra attack flying creatures with long spears, diving from above and allowing the momentum to carry the spear through the target. Such an attack doubles the damage if the aarakocra have been able to dive at least 50 feet. Only the very largest aarakocra can carry more than one of these spears, they can attack with both at once with no penalty, causing double damage on each strike. All diving attacks are made at +4 and should be treated as a charge attack. All other penalties and restrictions of charge attacks apply.</p><p>The effect of the aarakocra's nets depends on if the opponent is flying at the time it becomes entangled. Creatures on the ground that are hit by a net are entangled and unable to participate in any combat until they make a successful Strength check to get free of the net. Flying creatures hit by a net can no longer fly and immediately begin falling. If they cannot escape the net or use some magical means to arrest the fall, normal falling damage applies.</p><p>Unless victims are entangled in nets, aarakocra are cautious in ground combat. If the aarakocra outnumber their opponents they advance in a straight line and thrust with their spears. If outnumbered, or the opponents are particularly tough, the aarakocra withdraw. Victims entangled in nets are killed or incapacitated for use as food or ransom.</p><p>Athasian aarakocra are mindful of their physical limitations as well as their comparatively low psionic abilities. They do not normally initiate psionic combat. At the first sign of psionic powers from any of their victims, however, all aarakocra that have some ability will use whatever attack and defense modes they can in an attempt to destroy the threat. Large groups of is or more aarakocra may initiate psionic combat if their leaders feel they can win quickly and avoid physical combat.</p><p>In desperation, an aarakocra can attempt to bite an opponent in combat. Because of the unwieldiness of its beak, the aarakocra has a THAC0 of 18 if attacking with this appendage. Further, the birdman causes only 1d2 points of damage with the beak.</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Habitat/Society:</b> Athasian aarakocra live in tribes with 6-20 (2d8+4) members, depending on the prestige of the leader. The largest tribe ever recorded had 50 members. The tribal hunting territory depends on the size of the tribe, usually about 500 square miles for a tribe of 10 members. There are no rigid boundaries between tribes and border disputes are not uncommon.</p><p>Alignments of tribe members are similar to the alignment of the leader. A tribe that has a leader who is neutral good may have neutral good, chaotic good, lawful good, and true neutral members. A predominantly evil tribe does not recognize boundaries with other tribes and treats other tribes as inferior beings to be eliminated.</p><p>Athasian aarakocra aren't happy in enclosed spaces, but they they take refuge in a cave or building if necessary.</p><p>Nonevil tribes live in rocky aeries in the highest peaks they can find. Evil tribes are normally nomadic and use an aerie made by another tribe if they need to remain in an area for a long time, even if they have to evict the tribe that made the nest.</p><p>Aarakocra aren't friendly toward intruders in their territory, especially caravans. They try to extract a toll from the caravan for passage through the desert. Good-aligned tribes allow unhindered passage of caravans that pay a tribute. If someone refuses to pay the tribute, the aarakocra try to capture scouts or outriders from the party and hold them until an even larger tribute is paid. The payment may be either livestock or shiny objects. Aarakocra are smart enough not to be taken in by glass baubles instead of gems, although they cannot tell the difference between the more common gems and the rare ones.</p><p>Evil tribes ask for tribute and often attack a caravan whether it pays or not. Aarakocra always demand shiny objects such as stones. These tribes find humans and demihumans to be quite tasty and prefer them to other food.</p><p>Good-aligned tribes of aarakocra sometimes return a lost traveler to the edge of the desert after first removing any valuables the traveler may be carrying. On very rare occasions a tribe might return a lost group of travelers to the more frequently traveled parts of the desert, again after first taking any valuables as payment.</p><p>The oldest male is the leader of the tribal hunting party and has 4+4 Hit Dice. The oldest female is in charge of the tribal aerie and has 3+3 HD. In tribes that have more than 15 members, the next oldest aarakocra serves as shaman and has 3+3 HD; the shaman completes the triumvirate necessary for proper worship and the summoning of elementals. (Interestingly, no magic-using aarakocra has ever been recorded.) Tribes without a shaman cannot summon <a href=\"/appendix/element1\">air elementals</a>, which is an important part of aarakocra culture.</p><p>The shaman is the leader of the daily sun worship. Aarakocra worship the sun because it provides them with the thermals they need to soar in search of food. The shaman also leads the mystic rituals used to summon an air elemental. Summoning an air elemental is usually done only in preparation for the tribe's most sacred ceremony, the hunt. Small tribes must band together for this ceremony to allow the triumvirate to be formed.</p><p>The ceremony to summon an air elemental must be conducted at dawn and requires the oldest male and female to emit a highpitched keening whistle. The shaman conducts an intricate dance around them, simultaneously chanting an ancient summoning mantra.</p><p>The hunt is the final part of the initiation of adolescent aarakocra to adulthood and often takes the tribe far from their normal teritory. The target is always a <a href=\"/appendix/drakalsi\">silt drake</a>. The hunt is the only time the females leave the relative safety of the nest. Even an evil tribe will not interfere with a tribe on a hunt. An air elemental is often summoned to help find the drake, but never takes part in the actual combat. Although the adult members of the tribe take part in the initial phases of the combat, it is the initiates who deliver the final, killing blows to me drake. Scars from the hunt are considered a mark of pride among all aarakocra.</p><p>The females spend about eight months of the year incubating their eggs. Athasian aarakocra mate for life and a pair normally produces as many as 10 offspring. A female lays one egg a year. Constant incubation is not required because of the high daytime temperatures, so the females can maintain the nest and keep the tribe's treasure in order.</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Ecology:</b> Athasian aarakocra are high on the food chain and have no natural enemies other than <a href=\"/appendix/drakatha\">drakes</a>. Unless evil, aarakocra leave their own territory only to hunt the silt drake and return as soon as possible when the hunt is over. (Evil aarakocra attack others, as noted above.) Aarakocra eggs and hatchlings are sought after by wealthy land owners who wish to use the creatures as scouts and sentries. An egg can bring as much as 10 cp in Tyr's marketplace. Tribes that have had eggs or hatchlings stolen have long memories and sometimes take revenge against the thief at a later date. Captive aarakocra join any tribe they come in contact with.</p><p>Athasian aarakocra have a natural life span of 21-30 years.</p><p></p><br clear=\"all\" style=\"clear:both; height:0;\">\r\n","images":["<img src=\"grf/ds.gif\" width=\"150\" height=\"75\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Dark Sun\" title=\"Dark Sun\" align=\"right\">","<img src=\"img/aarakath.gif\" alt=\"Aarakocra (Athas)\" title=\"Aarakocra (Athas)\" border=\"0\" width=\"300\" height=\"360\" style=\"text-align:right;\" align=\"right\">","<img src=\"grf/add2_01.gif\" width=\"200\" height=\"56\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Advanced Dungeons & Dragons 2nd Edition\">"],"setting":"Dark Sun","statblock":{"Aarakocra (Athas)":{"Activity Cycle":"Day","Alignment":"Any","Armor Class":"7","Climate/Terrain":"Deep desert","Damage/Attack":"1d3/1d3 or by weapon","Diet":"Carnivore","Frequency":"Rare","Hit Dice":"2+2","Intelligence":"Average (8-10)","Magic Resistance":"Nil","Morale":"Steady (11)","Movement":"6, Fl 36 (C)","No. Appearing":"1d10","No. of Attacks":"2","Organization":"Tribal","Size":"M (20'+ wingspan)","Special Attacks":"Nil","Special Defenses":"Nil","THAC0":"17","Treasure":"Varies","XP Value":"65"}},"title":"Aarakocra (Athas)"},"sources":["2433"],"statblock_names":[],"title":"Aarakocra (Athas)","prev_key":"zygraat","next_key":"aarakocr","monster_path":"/appendix/aarakath"}}},"pageContext":{"monster_key":"yakman","monster_data":{"TSR":["2158","1077"],"fullBody":"  <table cellspacing=\"0\" cellpadding=\"0\"><tr><th>Climate/Terrain:</th><td>Moutains</td></tr><tr><th>Frequency:</th><td>Very rare</td></tr><tr><th>Organization:</th><td>Priesthood</td></tr><tr><th>Activity Cycle:</th><td>Day</td></tr><tr><th>Diet:</th><td>Omnivore</td></tr><tr><th>Intelligence:</th><td>Average to Genius (9-18)</td></tr><tr><th>Treasure:</th><td>P (D)</td></tr><tr><th>Alignment:</th><td>Neutral evil</td></tr><tr><th>No. Appearing:</th><td>1 or 1-4</td></tr><tr><th>Armor Class:</th><td>4</td></tr><tr><th>Movement:</th><td>9</td></tr><tr><th>Hit Dice:</th><td>5</td></tr><tr><th>THAC0:</th><td>15</td></tr><tr><th>No. of Attacks:</th><td>1</td></tr><tr><th>Damage/Attack:</th><td>1d10 or by weapon</td></tr><tr><th>Special Attacks:</th><td>See below</td></tr><tr><th>Special Defenses:</th><td>See below</td></tr><tr><th>Magic Resistance:</th><td>10%</td></tr><tr><th>Size:</th><td>L (8' tall)</td></tr><tr><th>Morale:</th><td>Elite (13-14)</td></tr><tr><th>XP Value:</th><td>1,400<br>Leader: 2,000</td></tr></table><p class=\"f\"><a href=\"/appendix/mammher2\">Yak</a>-men live in the highest mountains, comfortable among the foreboding heights and deep, hidden valleys of the most inaccessible ranges. Here, they maintain their petty empires, ruling all other life forms within their borders.</p><p>Yak-men, known among themselves as Yikaria (the &ldquo;Lucky Chosen&rdquo; in their native writing) are <a href=\"/appendix/ogre\">ogre</a>-sized humanoids with broad shoulders. Their heads are like those of disgruntled yaks, complete with curved horns and uniformly dour, sullen expressions. Male or female, their bodies are coated with thick fur and hair. Female yak-men are more slender, but otherwise they are very similar to the males in appearance; many outsiders cannot tell them apart. Both sexes wear long flowing robes and occasionally turbans. All carry staves, some of which are magical.</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Combat:</b> Yak-men have a number of powers that make them deadly opponents. They can use magical items regardless of normal magical abilities. Their leaders are spellcasters. They have the natural power to summon and command <a href=\"/appendix/genie\">dao genies</a>. Lastly, they boast a spell-like ability similar to the 5th-level wizard spell, <i>magic jar</i>. Each power is explained below.</p><p><i>Magical items.</i> All yak-men can use magical items, including items that are normally restricted to one class. If the item raises benefits and abilities that the yak-man doesn't have - for example, a magical device that doubles the number of spells learned - the yak-man gains nothing. However, if the item bestows a new power, the yak-man can gain that power.</p><p>These creatures are particularly attracted to magical staves. As a result, in any encounter, there is a 10% chance that one yak-man has a magical rod or staff of some type. Yak-men are always fully capable of using such item and rarely hesitate to do so.</p><p><i>Spellcasting lenders.</i> Yak-men leaders have no more Hit Dice than other yak-men, but they do have priest abilities that range from 1st to 10th level. They worship their own &ldquo;Forgotten God&rdquo; (see &ldquo;Habitat/Society&rdquo;). All spheres except plant and summoning are available. At 9th level, leaders become high priests of the faith and gain wizard spell abilities. Wizardry is performed as if they were of a level matching their priest abilities (they begin with 5th-level spells). Upon gaining wizard powers, high priests typically become members of the royal court and advisors to their emperor.</p><p><i>Commanding dao.</i> Each yak-man can summon a dao once per day, provided the yak-man does not already have a dao under his or her command. The dao becomes a slave; it must perform all actions that its master commands until the yakman decides to release it or until the sun has risen twice, whichever comes first. Yak-men are wise enough not to demand wishes, however. Instead they are content to exploit the dao's other impressive abilities. (The emperor of the yakmen uses dao as thugs, as well as a messenger service and spy network, with which to maintain control throughout his empire.)</p><p>The dao, of course, hate their imprisonment, but they take out their anger and frustration on the yak-men's enemies. No dao can attack a yak-man - not even a dao summoned by a yak-man's enemy. Dao summoned by others will, however, retain their initial loyalties. Under certain conditions, a dao may manage to harm a yak-man indirectly - by giving information to his enemies for example.</p><p><i>Unique magic jar.</i> The yak-men's most frightening weapon is their unique <i>magic jar</i> attack (which resembles the spell). With this power, a yak-man literally crawls under another's skin, controlling the foe's body, wreaking havoc, and becoming a spy for evil yak-men masters. The yak-man's magic jar is a touch attack. It takes two full turns to take effect, during which time the victim usually must be restrained. (Restraining actions are often cloaked in ritual, but the typical chanting and incense-burning ceremonies are entirely optional.) To fend off this insidious attack, the victim must make a successful saving throw vs. spell with a -4 penalty (cumulative with any other modifiers in effect).</p><p>Yak-men use this ability solely against humans, demihumans, and humanoids - including <a href=\"/appendix/elf\">elves</a>, <a href=\"/appendix/dwarf\">dwarves</a>, <a href=\"/appendix/orc\">orcs</a>, and <a href=\"/appendix/gianzakh\">giants</a>, but excluding genies, monstrous creatures, <a href=\"/appendix/mindflay\">mind-flayers</a>, and animals. When occupying another's flesh, a yak-man gains access to all of the victim's memories and knowledge. (This exceeds the power of the <i>magic jar</i> spell.) Although the yak-man retains his own powers, he does not gain any of the victim's magical, spell-like, or psionic abilities. The victim's life force is cast into the furthest reaches of the yak-man's own mind and kept unconscious there until it is returned to its normal state (or slain). Meanwhile, the yak-man's mind takes full control of the victim's body. Outwardly, the body does not change. <i>Detect magic</i> and the like cannot detect the yak-man's presence nor can a sha'ir (desert wizard) detect genie-work. A &ldquo;wise woman&rdquo; can sense something falx about the affected mortal, but even she cannot recognize this falsehood as a yakman's work unless she has dealt with this creature before.</p><p>The <i>magic jar</i> effects can be dispelled as the spell of the same name. Furthermore, a yak-man can choose to return to his own body at any time, at will, regardless of distance. The original life force regains consciousness. If either body is slain, then both the yak-man and the inhabited character perish immediately. A yak-man will flee an endangered mortal form to preserve his own life.</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Habitat/Society:</b> Most yak-men cities occupy the peaks of the highest mountains. An average city holds several thousand yak-men, plus five or six times that many slaves. Even the poorest yak-men keeps a servant or two, and slaves are the xak-men's  common currency. Buildings and other structures are made from a gray, greasy-textured stone that dao import from the Elemental Plane of Earth. The walls of a yak-man city rival those of the strongest human settlements.</p><p>Outposts of this brutal society lie in the narrow vales below the mountain peaks, each housing 11 to 20 yak-men. The numbers may seem scant, but a single outpost can dominate an entire valley, for it has the aid of 10 dao and 10 to 40 local enslaved warriors. The yak-men demand a portion of the low-land population as tribute for their &ldquo;wise and benevolent&rdquo; rule. Those who disagree with this attitude are destroyed. Their lands are given to slaves who are more receptive to the yak-men's will - that is, slaves willing to sacrifice a portion oftheir families to help ensure the remainder's survival.</p><p>Yak-men function as a unified, malignant theocracy. All are fanatical followers of their Forgotten God (a name used by outsiders; the yak-men's own name for their god is unknown). The worship of this savage deity directs their lives. The Forgotten God takes the general form of a yak-man, but the deity's face is worn smooth into a featureless mask. Great statues of the faceless god dominate yak-men temples, which occupy the highest crags of their home mountains.</p><p>The yak-men's dark deity is appeased by sacrifice, which the followers carry out by offering slaves in the &ldquo;Manner Elemental&rdquo; - that is by fire (immolation), earth (live burial), water (drowning), or air (throwing the victim off a mountain). Daily sacrifices ensure the ongoing benevolence of the deity. These hideous acts also strengthen the yak-men's domination of their land, since a slave who disobeys today almost certainly will meet his or her death on the morrow.</p><p>It was the Forgotten God who enabled the yak-men to enslave the dao. In a legend told by bards, it is said that the Forgotten God once journeyed to the Elemental Plane of Earth. There, through guile and deception, the deity defeated the ruler of the earth elementals. The price of that defeat was harsh: the dao were forced to serve the Forgotten God and its minions - and forbidden to attack them - for &ldquo;a thousand years and a year.&rdquo; (It is unclear how much of the sentence has passed, but sages are confident it will continue for centuries to come.)</p><p>Of late, the rest of the world has begun to interest the yak men, who see it as asource of new slaves and power. A foray into civilized realms typically involves a single scout or a party of one to four. A dao may accompany each yak-man. If a yak-man leader is present (10% chance), then any accompanying dao is <a href=\"/appendix/geninoda\">noble</a>.</p><p>For a single scout, the mission is usually reconaissance - helping yak-men gauge the strengths and weaknesses of their potential foes. Nearly all scouts are convicted criminals hoping to earn a new life among their fellow yak-men. (If they die on duty, it hardly matters.) Should the scout return to the home city with some remarkable treasure or an extraordinary parcel of slaves, his crimes will be forgiven. These scouts frequently make deals with evil humans. A single yak-man may return home with a caravan of servants, kidnapped or stolen, or with some other treasure, similarly &rdquo;hot&rdquo;.</p><p>A party of yak-men in civilized lands usually has a mission involving the members' <i>magic jar</i> abilities. They seek to kidnap a mortal or two and then inhabit their skins. (At least one yak-man guards the bodies of his or her companions.) Such spies strive to infiltrate the local ruling class; taking the place of a well-positioned servant or slave is a popular tactic. (It's more difficult to imitate someone with power or unusual ability.) After the mission is completed, when it's time for entertainment, a yak-man may force the inhabited body to run amok, spreading chaos, only to abandon control at the correct moment, leaving the confused mortal to pay the price for the yak-man's actions.</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Ecology:</b> Yak-men have an inhemt drive for knowledge, particularly dark knowledge that may serve to corrupt or dominate others. Knowledge that yak-men cannot gain or use immediately is to be destroyed. Unsentimental by nature, yak-men parents pack children off to communal creches once they are weaned, never to recognize them again. Yak-men feel no loyalty to their family - only to their god and to their inherently superior race as a whole.</p><p>Outsiders know little of the yak-men. For the most part they have remained within the confines of their lands, content to enslave or kill whomever enters it. To the other intelligent races, they are mysterious figures, treated as &rdquo;boogie men&rdquo; - a scary race of evil, ruthless, unenlightened, powerful savages who threaten the security of neighboring lands. The reputation is warranted.</p><p>All other races are slaves at best to the yak-men - even dao. There are rumors that dao leaders are working in conjunction with the Forgotten God, helping that deity facilitate its own besting other genie lords and the temporary enslavement of their races.</p><p></p><br clear=\"all\" style=\"clear:both; height:0;\">\r\n","images":["<img src=\"grf/aq.gif\" width=\"150\" height=\"75\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Al-Qadim (Forgotten Realms)\" title=\"Al-Qadim (Forgotten Realms)\" align=\"right\">","<img src=\"img/yakman.gif\" alt=\"Yak-Man\" title=\"Yak-Man\" border=\"0\" width=\"300\" height=\"360\" style=\"text-align:right;\" align=\"right\">","<img src=\"grf/add2_01.gif\" width=\"200\" height=\"56\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Advanced Dungeons & Dragons 2nd Edition\">"],"setting":"Al-Qadim (Forgotten Realms)","statblock":{"Yak-Man":{"Activity Cycle":"Day","Alignment":"Neutral evil","Armor Class":"4","Climate/Terrain":"Moutains","Damage/Attack":"1d10 or by weapon","Diet":"Omnivore","Frequency":"Very rare","Hit Dice":"5","Intelligence":"Average to Genius (9-18)","Magic Resistance":"10%","Morale":"Elite (13-14)","Movement":"9","No. Appearing":"1 or 1-4","No. of Attacks":"1","Organization":"Priesthood","Size":"L (8' tall)","Special Attacks":"See below","Special Defenses":"See below","THAC0":"15","Treasure":"P (D)","XP Value":"1,400<br>Leader: 2,000"}},"title":"Yak-Man"},"sources":["2158","1077"],"statblock_names":[],"title":"Yak-Man","prev_key":"yaggol","next_key":"yellbell","monster_path":"/appendix/yakman"}},"staticQueryHashes":[],"slicesMap":{}}
