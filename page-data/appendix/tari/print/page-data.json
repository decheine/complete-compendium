While the powers listed above are the most common, some aarakocra have different or additional powers.</p><p class=\"f\">A race of intelligent, birdlike creatures living in the deepest deserts of Athas, the rare Athasian <a href=\"/appendix/aarakocr\">aarakocra</a> spends its time soaring on thermals in search of food.</p><p>The aarakocra is 7 to 8 feet tall with a wingspan of 20 feet or more. Because of its large wingspan, an aarakocra can carry as much as 75% of its own body weight and still fly easily. An aarakocra can fly a short distance carrying a burden equaling 125% of its own body weight. The average body weight of a full grown male is 100 pounds and a female is 85 pounds.</p><p>Each wing has a &ldquo;hand&rdquo; at its midpoint, consisting of three fingers and an opposable thumb. The fourth finger forms the rigid leading edge of the wing. In flight the hands cannot be used, but on the ground the aarakocra can use its hands almost as a human would. The aarakocra's body is protected by a thin bony plate on the chest, much like a solid rib cage. Talons on its legs can be used as claws and can be retracted to reveal a second set of hands, also with three fingers and an opposable thumb. Except for the chest plate, the entire skeleton is hollow and extremely fragile.</p><p>From a distance, the Athasian aarakocra resembles a huge <a href=\"/appendix/bird\">vulture</a>. Its black eyes, set in the front of the head, provide excellent vision over a long range. The plumage is generally black with a white collar for adult males and black or brown with a smaller white collar for females. Adolescents are a mixture of brown and black. The beak is large and covers most of the head. Plumage begins at the crown of the head and is darker near the head, except for the collar. Athasian aarakocra speak their own language and the languages of vultures and other large birds. Some speak the common tongue (5% to 10% chance depending on how deep in the wastelands a tribe lives).</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Combat:</b> Aarakocra can fight in the air or on the ground. They prefer aerial combat since their bones are too fragile to withstand a solid blow from a human-sized opponent. In combat against creatures on the ground, they prefer to fly over their victim and drop weighted nets. Some aarakocra use darts to harass ground-based opponents.</p><p>If their opponents can fly, the aarakocra generally forgo the use of the net, although large groups sometimes use nets on flying creatures. Normally, aarakocra attack flying creatures with long spears, diving from above and allowing the momentum to carry the spear through the target. Such an attack doubles the damage if the aarakocra have been able to dive at least 50 feet. Only the very largest aarakocra can carry more than one of these spears, they can attack with both at once with no penalty, causing double damage on each strike. All diving attacks are made at +4 and should be treated as a charge attack. All other penalties and restrictions of charge attacks apply.</p><p>The effect of the aarakocra's nets depends on if the opponent is flying at the time it becomes entangled. Creatures on the ground that are hit by a net are entangled and unable to participate in any combat until they make a successful Strength check to get free of the net. Flying creatures hit by a net can no longer fly and immediately begin falling. If they cannot escape the net or use some magical means to arrest the fall, normal falling damage applies.</p><p>Unless victims are entangled in nets, aarakocra are cautious in ground combat. If the aarakocra outnumber their opponents they advance in a straight line and thrust with their spears. If outnumbered, or the opponents are particularly tough, the aarakocra withdraw. Victims entangled in nets are killed or incapacitated for use as food or ransom.</p><p>Athasian aarakocra are mindful of their physical limitations as well as their comparatively low psionic abilities. They do not normally initiate psionic combat. At the first sign of psionic powers from any of their victims, however, all aarakocra that have some ability will use whatever attack and defense modes they can in an attempt to destroy the threat. Large groups of is or more aarakocra may initiate psionic combat if their leaders feel they can win quickly and avoid physical combat.</p><p>In desperation, an aarakocra can attempt to bite an opponent in combat. Because of the unwieldiness of its beak, the aarakocra has a THAC0 of 18 if attacking with this appendage. Further, the birdman causes only 1d2 points of damage with the beak.</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Habitat/Society:</b> Athasian aarakocra live in tribes with 6-20 (2d8+4) members, depending on the prestige of the leader. The largest tribe ever recorded had 50 members. The tribal hunting territory depends on the size of the tribe, usually about 500 square miles for a tribe of 10 members. There are no rigid boundaries between tribes and border disputes are not uncommon.</p><p>Alignments of tribe members are similar to the alignment of the leader. A tribe that has a leader who is neutral good may have neutral good, chaotic good, lawful good, and true neutral members. A predominantly evil tribe does not recognize boundaries with other tribes and treats other tribes as inferior beings to be eliminated.</p><p>Athasian aarakocra aren't happy in enclosed spaces, but they they take refuge in a cave or building if necessary.</p><p>Nonevil tribes live in rocky aeries in the highest peaks they can find. Evil tribes are normally nomadic and use an aerie made by another tribe if they need to remain in an area for a long time, even if they have to evict the tribe that made the nest.</p><p>Aarakocra aren't friendly toward intruders in their territory, especially caravans. They try to extract a toll from the caravan for passage through the desert. Good-aligned tribes allow unhindered passage of caravans that pay a tribute. If someone refuses to pay the tribute, the aarakocra try to capture scouts or outriders from the party and hold them until an even larger tribute is paid. The payment may be either livestock or shiny objects. Aarakocra are smart enough not to be taken in by glass baubles instead of gems, although they cannot tell the difference between the more common gems and the rare ones.</p><p>Evil tribes ask for tribute and often attack a caravan whether it pays or not. Aarakocra always demand shiny objects such as stones. These tribes find humans and demihumans to be quite tasty and prefer them to other food.</p><p>Good-aligned tribes of aarakocra sometimes return a lost traveler to the edge of the desert after first removing any valuables the traveler may be carrying. On very rare occasions a tribe might return a lost group of travelers to the more frequently traveled parts of the desert, again after first taking any valuables as payment.</p><p>The oldest male is the leader of the tribal hunting party and has 4+4 Hit Dice. The oldest female is in charge of the tribal aerie and has 3+3 HD. In tribes that have more than 15 members, the next oldest aarakocra serves as shaman and has 3+3 HD; the shaman completes the triumvirate necessary for proper worship and the summoning of elementals. (Interestingly, no magic-using aarakocra has ever been recorded.) Tribes without a shaman cannot summon <a href=\"/appendix/element1\">air elementals</a>, which is an important part of aarakocra culture.</p><p>The shaman is the leader of the daily sun worship. Aarakocra worship the sun because it provides them with the thermals they need to soar in search of food. The shaman also leads the mystic rituals used to summon an air elemental. Summoning an air elemental is usually done only in preparation for the tribe's most sacred ceremony, the hunt. Small tribes must band together for this ceremony to allow the triumvirate to be formed.</p><p>The ceremony to summon an air elemental must be conducted at dawn and requires the oldest male and female to emit a highpitched keening whistle. The shaman conducts an intricate dance around them, simultaneously chanting an ancient summoning mantra.</p><p>The hunt is the final part of the initiation of adolescent aarakocra to adulthood and often takes the tribe far from their normal teritory. The target is always a <a href=\"/appendix/drakalsi\">silt drake</a>. The hunt is the only time the females leave the relative safety of the nest. Even an evil tribe will not interfere with a tribe on a hunt. An air elemental is often summoned to help find the drake, but never takes part in the actual combat. Although the adult members of the tribe take part in the initial phases of the combat, it is the initiates who deliver the final, killing blows to me drake. Scars from the hunt are considered a mark of pride among all aarakocra.</p><p>The females spend about eight months of the year incubating their eggs. Athasian aarakocra mate for life and a pair normally produces as many as 10 offspring. A female lays one egg a year. Constant incubation is not required because of the high daytime temperatures, so the females can maintain the nest and keep the tribe's treasure in order.</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Ecology:</b> Athasian aarakocra are high on the food chain and have no natural enemies other than <a href=\"/appendix/drakatha\">drakes</a>. Unless evil, aarakocra leave their own territory only to hunt the silt drake and return as soon as possible when the hunt is over. (Evil aarakocra attack others, as noted above.) Aarakocra eggs and hatchlings are sought after by wealthy land owners who wish to use the creatures as scouts and sentries. An egg can bring as much as 10 cp in Tyr's marketplace. Tribes that have had eggs or hatchlings stolen have long memories and sometimes take revenge against the thief at a later date. Captive aarakocra join any tribe they come in contact with.</p><p>Athasian aarakocra have a natural life span of 21-30 years.</p><p></p><br clear=\"all\" style=\"clear:both; height:0;\">\r\n","images":["<img src=\"grf/ds.gif\" width=\"150\" height=\"75\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Dark Sun\" title=\"Dark Sun\" align=\"right\">","<img src=\"img/aarakath.gif\" alt=\"Aarakocra (Athas)\" title=\"Aarakocra (Athas)\" border=\"0\" width=\"300\" height=\"360\" style=\"text-align:right;\" align=\"right\">","<img src=\"grf/add2_01.gif\" width=\"200\" height=\"56\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Advanced Dungeons & Dragons 2nd Edition\">"],"setting":"Dark Sun","statblock":{"Aarakocra (Athas)":{"Activity Cycle":"Day","Alignment":"Any","Armor Class":"7","Climate/Terrain":"Deep desert","Damage/Attack":"1d3/1d3 or by weapon","Diet":"Carnivore","Frequency":"Rare","Hit Dice":"2+2","Intelligence":"Average (8-10)","Magic Resistance":"Nil","Morale":"Steady (11)","Movement":"6, Fl 36 (C)","No. Appearing":"1d10","No. of Attacks":"2","Organization":"Tribal","Size":"M (20'+ wingspan)","Special Attacks":"Nil","Special Defenses":"Nil","THAC0":"17","Treasure":"Varies","XP Value":"65"}},"title":"Aarakocra (Athas)"},"sources":["2433"],"statblock_names":[],"title":"Aarakocra (Athas)","prev_key":"zygraat","next_key":"aarakocr","monster_path":"/appendix/aarakath"}}},"pageContext":{"monster_key":"tari","monster_data":{"TSR":["2433"],"fullBody":"  <table cellspacing=\"0\" cellpadding=\"0\"><tr class=\"bk\"><th> </th><th class=\"cn\">Tari</th><th class=\"cn\">Warrior</th><th class=\"cn\">Chieftain</th></tr><tr><th>Climate/Terrain:</th><td>Any</td><td>Any</td><td>Any</td></tr><tr><th>Frequency:</th><td>Uncommon</td><td>Rare</td><td>Very rare</td></tr><tr><th>Organization:</th><td>Pack</td><td>Pack</td><td>Pack</td></tr><tr><th>Activity Cycle:</th><td>Night</td><td>Night</td><td>Night</td></tr><tr><th>Diet:</th><td>Scavenger</td><td>Scavenger</td><td>Scavenger</td></tr><tr><th>Intelligence:</th><td>Average (8-10)</td><td>Average (8-10)</td><td>Average (8-10)</td></tr><tr><th>Treasure:</th><td>M (C)</td><td>M (C)</td><td>M (C)</td></tr><tr><th>Alignment:</th><td>Neutral</td><td>Neutral</td><td>Neutral</td></tr><tr><th>No. Appearing:</th><td>5-30</td><td>2-12</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><th>Armor Class:</th><td>6</td><td>5</td><td>6</td></tr><tr><th>Movement:</th><td>9</td><td>9</td><td>9</td></tr><tr><th>Hit Dice:</th><td>3</td><td>4+2</td><td>4</td></tr><tr><th>THAC0:</th><td>17</td><td>17</td><td>17</td></tr><tr><th>No. of Attacks:</th><td>1</td><td>3</td><td>2</td></tr><tr><th>Damage/Attack:</th><td>1-3 bite or by weapon</td><td>1-8/1-8/1-3</td><td>1-6/1-3</td></tr><tr><th>Special Attacks:</th><td>Disease</td><td>Disease</td><td>Disease</td></tr><tr><th>Special Defenses:</th><td>Nil</td><td>Nil</td><td>Nil</td></tr><tr><th>Magic Resistance:</th><td>Nil</td><td>Nil</td><td>Nil</td></tr><tr><th>Size:</th><td>S (4' tall)</td><td>M (5' tall)</td><td>M (5' tall)</td></tr><tr><th>Morale:</th><td>Average (8-10)</td><td>Champion (15-16)</td><td>Average (8-10)</td></tr><tr><th>XP Value:</th><td>120</td><td>175</td><td>175/270</td></tr></table><p class=\"f\">The tari are commonly referred to as ratmen by the other denizens of the Tyr region. They are small, furry humanoid scavengers, capable of thriving on food and water too polluted for humans to ingest. Hunted freely as pests, the tari are the barbaric descendants of a once thriving culture who inhabited lands to the south of the Tyr region.</p><p>The tari are unimpressive creatures, roughly 5' tall and weighing 100 pounds. They move about as bipeds, but sometimes walk on their knuckles. Their tails are about 2½' long, used mainly for balance, and just strong enough that they can wrap it around a branch and hang from it. Their entire bodies are covered with fine fur, usually brown, but sometimes gray, golden, or even silver, or a combination of any of these. Many tari use dyes from gyava berries to create rings or spots of color for decoration. Males and females alike often braid the longer hair along the back of the neck and the base of the spine and decorate these with beads or feathers. Their mouths are filled with needlelike teeth, and to either side they have long black hairs that add to their overall ratlike appearance.</p><p>Tari wear no clothing, though warriors sometimes have leather jerkins or even chitin greaves. Chieftains and warriors are taller than other tari and the former are usually highly decorated with dyes, beads, and ceremonial garb.</p><p>Tari have a high-pitched, squeaky language all their own. They can send and receive some signals that are beyond the human ear's ability to hear. Chieftains sometimes have psionic powers that allow them to communicate with their packs and other beings. Tari can learn other languages, namely human and <a href=\"/appendix/elfathas\">elven</a>, though the sounds of humanoid speech are difficult for them to make with their mouths. There is a 5% chance a tari knows human or elven, but only a 50% chance that humans understand the communication.</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Combat:</b> Tari are nocturnal scavengers and hunters that travel in packs. A pack attacks humans or human-sized animals only if they outnumber them three to one. A pack has 5-30 normal tari, 2-12 warriors. and 1 chieftain. If they decide to attack, they wait until the quietest hours before dawn to surround and then attack. Warriors always stay in a single group around one arc of the enclosing circle, and the chieftain advances behind his warriors. Tari do not attack foes larger than human-sized, but they will trail the injured and weak, hoping they perish in the desert</p><p>Normal tari have a 50% chance of having a weapon, usually a wooden or bone sword or spear that lnflicts 1-6 (1d6) points of damage. Those without weapons bite for 1-3 points of damage. Warriors fight with two bone weapons that each cause 1-8 (1d8) points of damage and can bite in the same round. Chieftains fight with ceremonial clubs that inflict 1-6 (1d6) points of damage and bite.</p><p>Each time a tari successfully bites an opponent it has a 5% chance of lnflicting a disease. The victim can avoid the effects if he successfully saves vs. poison. Once infected, the victim becomes feverish and virtually incapacitated in 1-6 hours. On the third day after contracting the disease, the victim loses 1-3 hit points per day, permanently. There are many false cures for the tari disease sold in the marketplaces of Athas. The only sure means is a <i>cure disease</i> spell. Even that will not restore the lost hit points.</p><p>Each tari chieftain has one psionic wild talent that the DM should determine during an encounter by using <i>The Complete Psionic Handbook</i>. If the wild talent has any combat value, the pack changes its tactics to take advantage and, if defeated, the chieftain is worth the higher XP value listed. If the chieftain is slain, the rest of the tari flee.</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Habitat/Society:</b> The lives of the urban and wilderness tari are quite different, though their tactics for the kill are universal. Both travel in packs, but their approaches to survival are quite different.</p><p>The urban tari are denizens of the sewers and garbage heaps. By day they sleep beneath the filth of human society, and by night they gather the food and water to keep themselves alive, but they also seek out creature comforts for themselves and their chieftains. The small, furry thieves scour the buildings, scurrying up walls and through windows, stealing everything they can. They aren't particularly good thieves, making a lot of noise, upsetting tables and toppling chairs in their clumsy approach. Though not work for children, a warrior can earn a good living hunting tari, earning about 8 ceramic pieces a head.</p><p>The urban tari lair is a hodgepodge of stolen finery and trash. Crates are covered with silk and linens, while plush pillows and rugs adorn the floors and walls. Ratmen tend their chieftain who wears the jewelry and rags the neighborhood provides. If left alone, a tari pack can live in relative luxury, unnoticed beneath the bustling city.</p><p>The wilderness, however, is not so kind. Wasteland tari are nomadic scavengers, scouting miles in all directions to find the richest grounds, contending with the desert's other creatures for the little food to be had. Wilderness tari move their few belongings and families in triangular frames of leather and wooden poles. These frames are piled with belongings and dragged along the ground. Occasionally, tari use pack animals, such as <a href=\"/appendix/animdoa1\">inix</a> or <a href=\"/appendix/crodlu\">crodlu</a>. Corralling such a beast can take an entire pack and cost many tari lives. Tari animal handlers are very rare, but can become very important to the wilderness packs.</p><p>The tari race once boasted a thriving culture far to the south of the Tvr region. Ythri, the legendary capital city, is now a ruin lost among the crags. Their education and knowledge was much greater than today and their technology allowed them to build stone and concrete structures. What happened to their civilization is a mystery. The tari of the Tyr region have no written history. What remains is a collection of exaggerated myths and legends describing wondrous works.</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Ecology:</b> Tari mate once per year. The females of a single pack go into heat during the conjunction of the moons, initiating the mating season. Each female gestates for six months before giving birth to a litter of 2-8 young. The baby tari rely on the mother for their nourishment for the first three months of their lives, after which they are taught to hunt and survive on their own.</p><p>Young tari require another year to gain full maturity. During that time they are taught the harsh survival skills of the wilderness or the thieving and stealth skills of the city. Immature tari receive only 1 Hit Die and there can be 3-36 of them with a pack in its lair.</p><p>Their disease-causing venom is produced by two glands set deep in the jaw. Each bite produces a flow of venom that sprays from two openings to either side of the main canines. Retrieving the glands from fallen tari is a difficult and dangerous task, but the deadly properties of their contents makes them valuable to the alchemists and bards of the cities. A pair of tari disease glands can bring as much as 12 ceramic bits in the larger cities.</p><p></p><br clear=\"all\" style=\"clear:both; height:0;\">\r\n","images":["<img src=\"grf/ds.gif\" width=\"150\" height=\"75\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Dark Sun\" title=\"Dark Sun\" align=\"right\">","<img src=\"img/tari.gif\" alt=\"Tari\" title=\"Tari\" border=\"0\" width=\"300\" height=\"360\" style=\"text-align:right;\" align=\"right\">","<img src=\"grf/add2_01.gif\" width=\"200\" height=\"56\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Advanced Dungeons & Dragons 2nd Edition\">"],"setting":"Dark Sun","statblock":{"Chieftain":{"Activity Cycle":"Night","Alignment":"Neutral","Armor Class":"6","Climate/Terrain":"Any","Damage/Attack":"1-6/1-3","Diet":"Scavenger","Frequency":"Very rare","Hit Dice":"4","Intelligence":"Average (8-10)","Magic Resistance":"Nil","Morale":"Average (8-10)","Movement":"9","No. Appearing":"1","No. of Attacks":"2","Organization":"Pack","Size":"M (5' tall)","Special Attacks":"Disease","Special Defenses":"Nil","THAC0":"17","Treasure":"M (C)","XP Value":"175/270"},"Tari":{"Activity Cycle":"Night","Alignment":"Neutral","Armor Class":"6","Climate/Terrain":"Any","Damage/Attack":"1-3 bite or by weapon","Diet":"Scavenger","Frequency":"Uncommon","Hit Dice":"3","Intelligence":"Average (8-10)","Magic Resistance":"Nil","Morale":"Average (8-10)","Movement":"9","No. Appearing":"5-30","No. of Attacks":"1","Organization":"Pack","Size":"S (4' tall)","Special Attacks":"Disease","Special Defenses":"Nil","THAC0":"17","Treasure":"M (C)","XP Value":"120"},"Warrior":{"Activity Cycle":"Night","Alignment":"Neutral","Armor Class":"5","Climate/Terrain":"Any","Damage/Attack":"1-8/1-8/1-3","Diet":"Scavenger","Frequency":"Rare","Hit Dice":"4+2","Intelligence":"Average (8-10)","Magic Resistance":"Nil","Morale":"Champion (15-16)","Movement":"9","No. Appearing":"2-12","No. of Attacks":"3","Organization":"Pack","Size":"M (5' tall)","Special Attacks":"Disease","Special Defenses":"Nil","THAC0":"17","Treasure":"M (C)","XP Value":"175"}},"title":"Tari"},"sources":["2433"],"statblock_names":[],"title":"Tari","prev_key":"tarek","next_key":"tarrasqu","monster_path":"/appendix/tari"}},"staticQueryHashes":[],"slicesMap":{}}
