While the powers listed above are the most common, some aarakocra have different or additional powers.</p><p class=\"f\">A race of intelligent, birdlike creatures living in the deepest deserts of Athas, the rare Athasian <a href=\"/appendix/aarakocr\">aarakocra</a> spends its time soaring on thermals in search of food.</p><p>The aarakocra is 7 to 8 feet tall with a wingspan of 20 feet or more. Because of its large wingspan, an aarakocra can carry as much as 75% of its own body weight and still fly easily. An aarakocra can fly a short distance carrying a burden equaling 125% of its own body weight. The average body weight of a full grown male is 100 pounds and a female is 85 pounds.</p><p>Each wing has a &ldquo;hand&rdquo; at its midpoint, consisting of three fingers and an opposable thumb. The fourth finger forms the rigid leading edge of the wing. In flight the hands cannot be used, but on the ground the aarakocra can use its hands almost as a human would. The aarakocra's body is protected by a thin bony plate on the chest, much like a solid rib cage. Talons on its legs can be used as claws and can be retracted to reveal a second set of hands, also with three fingers and an opposable thumb. Except for the chest plate, the entire skeleton is hollow and extremely fragile.</p><p>From a distance, the Athasian aarakocra resembles a huge <a href=\"/appendix/bird\">vulture</a>. Its black eyes, set in the front of the head, provide excellent vision over a long range. The plumage is generally black with a white collar for adult males and black or brown with a smaller white collar for females. Adolescents are a mixture of brown and black. The beak is large and covers most of the head. Plumage begins at the crown of the head and is darker near the head, except for the collar. Athasian aarakocra speak their own language and the languages of vultures and other large birds. Some speak the common tongue (5% to 10% chance depending on how deep in the wastelands a tribe lives).</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Combat:</b> Aarakocra can fight in the air or on the ground. They prefer aerial combat since their bones are too fragile to withstand a solid blow from a human-sized opponent. In combat against creatures on the ground, they prefer to fly over their victim and drop weighted nets. Some aarakocra use darts to harass ground-based opponents.</p><p>If their opponents can fly, the aarakocra generally forgo the use of the net, although large groups sometimes use nets on flying creatures. Normally, aarakocra attack flying creatures with long spears, diving from above and allowing the momentum to carry the spear through the target. Such an attack doubles the damage if the aarakocra have been able to dive at least 50 feet. Only the very largest aarakocra can carry more than one of these spears, they can attack with both at once with no penalty, causing double damage on each strike. All diving attacks are made at +4 and should be treated as a charge attack. All other penalties and restrictions of charge attacks apply.</p><p>The effect of the aarakocra's nets depends on if the opponent is flying at the time it becomes entangled. Creatures on the ground that are hit by a net are entangled and unable to participate in any combat until they make a successful Strength check to get free of the net. Flying creatures hit by a net can no longer fly and immediately begin falling. If they cannot escape the net or use some magical means to arrest the fall, normal falling damage applies.</p><p>Unless victims are entangled in nets, aarakocra are cautious in ground combat. If the aarakocra outnumber their opponents they advance in a straight line and thrust with their spears. If outnumbered, or the opponents are particularly tough, the aarakocra withdraw. Victims entangled in nets are killed or incapacitated for use as food or ransom.</p><p>Athasian aarakocra are mindful of their physical limitations as well as their comparatively low psionic abilities. They do not normally initiate psionic combat. At the first sign of psionic powers from any of their victims, however, all aarakocra that have some ability will use whatever attack and defense modes they can in an attempt to destroy the threat. Large groups of is or more aarakocra may initiate psionic combat if their leaders feel they can win quickly and avoid physical combat.</p><p>In desperation, an aarakocra can attempt to bite an opponent in combat. Because of the unwieldiness of its beak, the aarakocra has a THAC0 of 18 if attacking with this appendage. Further, the birdman causes only 1d2 points of damage with the beak.</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Habitat/Society:</b> Athasian aarakocra live in tribes with 6-20 (2d8+4) members, depending on the prestige of the leader. The largest tribe ever recorded had 50 members. The tribal hunting territory depends on the size of the tribe, usually about 500 square miles for a tribe of 10 members. There are no rigid boundaries between tribes and border disputes are not uncommon.</p><p>Alignments of tribe members are similar to the alignment of the leader. A tribe that has a leader who is neutral good may have neutral good, chaotic good, lawful good, and true neutral members. A predominantly evil tribe does not recognize boundaries with other tribes and treats other tribes as inferior beings to be eliminated.</p><p>Athasian aarakocra aren't happy in enclosed spaces, but they they take refuge in a cave or building if necessary.</p><p>Nonevil tribes live in rocky aeries in the highest peaks they can find. Evil tribes are normally nomadic and use an aerie made by another tribe if they need to remain in an area for a long time, even if they have to evict the tribe that made the nest.</p><p>Aarakocra aren't friendly toward intruders in their territory, especially caravans. They try to extract a toll from the caravan for passage through the desert. Good-aligned tribes allow unhindered passage of caravans that pay a tribute. If someone refuses to pay the tribute, the aarakocra try to capture scouts or outriders from the party and hold them until an even larger tribute is paid. The payment may be either livestock or shiny objects. Aarakocra are smart enough not to be taken in by glass baubles instead of gems, although they cannot tell the difference between the more common gems and the rare ones.</p><p>Evil tribes ask for tribute and often attack a caravan whether it pays or not. Aarakocra always demand shiny objects such as stones. These tribes find humans and demihumans to be quite tasty and prefer them to other food.</p><p>Good-aligned tribes of aarakocra sometimes return a lost traveler to the edge of the desert after first removing any valuables the traveler may be carrying. On very rare occasions a tribe might return a lost group of travelers to the more frequently traveled parts of the desert, again after first taking any valuables as payment.</p><p>The oldest male is the leader of the tribal hunting party and has 4+4 Hit Dice. The oldest female is in charge of the tribal aerie and has 3+3 HD. In tribes that have more than 15 members, the next oldest aarakocra serves as shaman and has 3+3 HD; the shaman completes the triumvirate necessary for proper worship and the summoning of elementals. (Interestingly, no magic-using aarakocra has ever been recorded.) Tribes without a shaman cannot summon <a href=\"/appendix/element1\">air elementals</a>, which is an important part of aarakocra culture.</p><p>The shaman is the leader of the daily sun worship. Aarakocra worship the sun because it provides them with the thermals they need to soar in search of food. The shaman also leads the mystic rituals used to summon an air elemental. Summoning an air elemental is usually done only in preparation for the tribe's most sacred ceremony, the hunt. Small tribes must band together for this ceremony to allow the triumvirate to be formed.</p><p>The ceremony to summon an air elemental must be conducted at dawn and requires the oldest male and female to emit a highpitched keening whistle. The shaman conducts an intricate dance around them, simultaneously chanting an ancient summoning mantra.</p><p>The hunt is the final part of the initiation of adolescent aarakocra to adulthood and often takes the tribe far from their normal teritory. The target is always a <a href=\"/appendix/drakalsi\">silt drake</a>. The hunt is the only time the females leave the relative safety of the nest. Even an evil tribe will not interfere with a tribe on a hunt. An air elemental is often summoned to help find the drake, but never takes part in the actual combat. Although the adult members of the tribe take part in the initial phases of the combat, it is the initiates who deliver the final, killing blows to me drake. Scars from the hunt are considered a mark of pride among all aarakocra.</p><p>The females spend about eight months of the year incubating their eggs. Athasian aarakocra mate for life and a pair normally produces as many as 10 offspring. A female lays one egg a year. Constant incubation is not required because of the high daytime temperatures, so the females can maintain the nest and keep the tribe's treasure in order.</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Ecology:</b> Athasian aarakocra are high on the food chain and have no natural enemies other than <a href=\"/appendix/drakatha\">drakes</a>. Unless evil, aarakocra leave their own territory only to hunt the silt drake and return as soon as possible when the hunt is over. (Evil aarakocra attack others, as noted above.) Aarakocra eggs and hatchlings are sought after by wealthy land owners who wish to use the creatures as scouts and sentries. An egg can bring as much as 10 cp in Tyr's marketplace. Tribes that have had eggs or hatchlings stolen have long memories and sometimes take revenge against the thief at a later date. Captive aarakocra join any tribe they come in contact with.</p><p>Athasian aarakocra have a natural life span of 21-30 years.</p><p></p><br clear=\"all\" style=\"clear:both; height:0;\">\r\n","images":["<img src=\"grf/ds.gif\" width=\"150\" height=\"75\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Dark Sun\" title=\"Dark Sun\" align=\"right\">","<img src=\"img/aarakath.gif\" alt=\"Aarakocra (Athas)\" title=\"Aarakocra (Athas)\" border=\"0\" width=\"300\" height=\"360\" style=\"text-align:right;\" align=\"right\">","<img src=\"grf/add2_01.gif\" width=\"200\" height=\"56\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Advanced Dungeons & Dragons 2nd Edition\">"],"setting":"Dark Sun","statblock":{"Aarakocra (Athas)":{"Activity Cycle":"Day","Alignment":"Any","Armor Class":"7","Climate/Terrain":"Deep desert","Damage/Attack":"1d3/1d3 or by weapon","Diet":"Carnivore","Frequency":"Rare","Hit Dice":"2+2","Intelligence":"Average (8-10)","Magic Resistance":"Nil","Morale":"Steady (11)","Movement":"6, Fl 36 (C)","No. Appearing":"1d10","No. of Attacks":"2","Organization":"Tribal","Size":"M (20'+ wingspan)","Special Attacks":"Nil","Special Defenses":"Nil","THAC0":"17","Treasure":"Varies","XP Value":"65"}},"title":"Aarakocra (Athas)"},"sources":["2433"],"statblock_names":[],"title":"Aarakocra (Athas)","prev_key":"zygraat","next_key":"aarakocr","monster_path":"/appendix/aarakath"}}},"pageContext":{"monster_key":"horg","monster_data":{"TSR":["9374"],"fullBody":"  <table cellspacing=\"0\" cellpadding=\"0\"><tr><th>Climate/Terrain:</th>  <td>The Grinder</td></tr><tr><th>Frequency:</th>        <td>Very Rare</td></tr><tr><th>Organization:</th>     <td>War-bands</td></tr><tr><th>Activity Cycle:</th>   <td>Any</td></tr><tr><th>Diet:</th>             <td>Carnivore</td></tr><tr><th>Intelligence:</th>     <td>Average ( 10)</td></tr><tr><th>Treasure:</th>         <td>Individual: J, K, L, M, (B)</td></tr><tr><th>Alignment:</th>        <td>Neutral Evil</td></tr><tr><th>No. Appearing:</th>    <td>3-18</td></tr><tr><th>Armor Class:</th>      <td>4</td></tr><tr><th>Movement:</th>         <td>6, Fl 18 (B), also in a vacuum</td></tr><tr><th>Hit Dice:</th>         <td>4+4</td></tr><tr><th>THAC0:</th>            <td>13</td></tr><tr><th>No. of Attacks:</th>   <td>3</td></tr><tr><th>Damage/Attack:</th>    <td>1-8/2-20/2-20</td></tr><tr><th>Special Attacks:</th>  <td>Poison</td></tr><tr><th>Special Defenses:</th> <td>See below</td></tr><tr><th>Magic Resistance:</th> <td>5%</td></tr><tr><th>Size:</th>             <td>M (7')</td></tr><tr><th>Morale:</th>           <td>Fanatic (18)</td></tr><tr><th>XP Value:</th>         <td>1,600</td></tr></table><p class=\"f\">Horgs are strange sentient lifeforms perfectly adapted for life in the asteroid belt of the Grinder. At a distance, they look like winged humanoids, standing about 7' tall. Their long, membranous wings, with a maximum span of about 12', replace their arms; each is tipped with a single, scimitar-like claw more than a foot long and scalpel-sharp. Their torsos are longer than a human's, while their muscular legs, tipped with three-taloned feet, are shorter.</p><p>On closer inspection, they have obviously evolved along lines very different from humanoids. They have seven eyes, arranged in a ring around their heads. These eyes are a pus-like yellow-white with no discernible pupils. Because of the arrangement of the eyes, it is impossible to sneak up on a horg's blind side. Although the rest of the body is bilaterally symmet_ rical, the bulbous head is asymmetrical, with no obvious analogues of ears or nostrils. The creature has a circular, tooth-filled mouth th at opens like the iris of a camera, positioned on the top of its head. Its back is flexible enough that it can lash forward with its upper body and bite a creature standing in front of it or behind it.</p><p>They are unrelieved black in color, with a dry, dusty texture: They have no hair or scales, just dry, flexible skin. Vital areas of their bodies - their chests, backs and groins - are protected by built-up layers of skin, almost like rock-hard calluses. They have no evident or overt genitalia.</p><p>Horgs can walk clumsily on their hind legs. They are much more comfortable in the air, or flying through the vacuum of wildspace. When they fly, they beat their wings like a bat-even in space, where there is no air for their wings to act upon. They are highly maneuverable. The positioning of their mouth indicates that they evolved to feed on the wing, when their mouth will be pointing forward. Presumably there is some organ in the horg body that allows them to \"fly\" in a vacuum. For reasons discussed later, this organ has never been investigated.</p><p>Horgs have no spoken language. In fact, they seem to have no sound-producing organs at all. The only sound they ever make is the dry rustling of their wing membranes when they fly.</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Combat:</b> Horgs are born warriors. Even a newborn horg can shred any but the best human fighter. They attack by biting and by clawing with the long, curved talons on their wingtips. Although the claws on their feet look threatening, they never seem to use them in combat. The creatures secrete a highly corrosive, poisonous liquid from their teeth and from pores at the tips of their wing talons. Any creature wounded by either teeth or claw suffers the toxic effects of this liquid. Each round after the successful hit, the victim suffers 2d10 hit points of damage (save vs. poison for half-damage). This damage continues for 10 rounds, or until the victim dies. Note that this damage is cumulative from attack to attack.</p><p>What makes the creatures even more lethal is their ability to phase in and out of the Prime Material Plane like phase spiders. They can phase in, attack, and phase out, all in a single round. This gives them a -3 modifier on initiative roll. If the horgs win the initiate roll by more than 4 points, they attack and phase out before their opponents get a chance to strike back. Also, horgs frequently phase in behind their opponents so they get the + 4 modifier for attacking from behind. On the Ethereal Plane, horgs get only a -1 modifier on initiative and can be attacked every round, regardless of the initiative result. Although horgs can flee to the Ethereal Plane when outmatched, they rarely do so.</p><p>Horgs seem to have an innate understanding of small-unit tactics. Even though they never seem to communicate with one another, they always coordinate their actions perfectly. They never seem to attack a group too powerful for them to overcome. If they misjudge the situation, however, and thereby suffer some unpredictable setback or see their foes reinforced, they rarely retreat from combat. It is almost as if conceding the combat to their foes is unacceptable in their eyes-even more unacceptable than death from combat.</p><p>When a horg is killed, its body immediately phases out and vanishes from the Prime Material Plane. (This is why so little in known about horg physiology-no corpse has ever been available for study.) Normally, when a horg phases out it can be pursued by someone with access to the Elemental Plane. On the creature's death, however, it phases to another plane-not the Elemental Plane. Nobody has been able to determine what plane this is. (This final phase-out has led some sages to suspect that horgs are not native to the Prime Material Plane or the Elemental Plane, and that, on death, their bodies return to their plane of origin.)</p><p>No horg has ever been captured. Normal attempts at confinement do not work because the creatures can phase out and escape on the Elemental Plane. If a horg <i>is</i> somehow successfully confined, however, it invariably commits suicide by apparently just by willing itself to die-and its body phases out and vanishes.</p><p>Horgs are totally resistant to mind-altering magics of all kinds. They are highly resistant to cold-based and electricity-based spells, receiving a +3 bonus to their saving throws against these attacks. Even though there is some suspicion they are extra-planar creatures, they are unaffected by <i>(un)holy words</i> and other banishing magics.</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Habitat/Society:</b> Effectively nothing is known about the society or habitat of horgs. They have never been observed except when they choose to attack a ship or asteroid settlement. Nobody knows where they live between such attacks. Perhaps they dwell on the Elemental Plane or some other, or within one of the asteroids of The Grinder, but these are just guesses.</p><p>Horgs do not seem to be sexually differentiated. This could mean several things. Perhaps the race has no sexual differentiation (raising questions about just what their reproductive cycle is like); or perhaps the differences between sexes, whether two or more, is simply not obvious to the casual observer; or perhaps only one sex participates in their attacks. No immature horg has ever been spotted.</p><p>No horg has ever been seen to use a tool or weapon. This could be by choice, or because the creatures, although evidently intelligent, have no tendency to create or use tools.</p><p>The preceding paragraphs describe what is not known about horgs. What is known is all too little. They are highly aggressive, attacking without provocation or warning. Attempts to correlate the frequency of attacks with a particular region of space, or perhaps with proximity to a particular asteroid, have all failed. No spacefaring race has escaped the predations of the horgs. While all races hate and fear them, the neogi hate them the most-probably because the horgs are even more evil and rapacious than they are!</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Ecology:</b> Nobody knows what the horgs eat, or even if they eat at all. When they kill foes in combat, they do not eat the bodies nor carry the corpses off with them. If they have any natural enemies that prey upon them, these predators have never been detected. With the current level of knowledge, it appears that horgs lie outside the normal food chain and ecology of Greyspace.</p><p></p><br clear=\"all\" style=\"clear:both; height:0;\">\r\n","images":["<img src=\"grf/sj.gif\" width=\"150\" height=\"75\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Spelljammer\" title=\"Spelljammer\" align=\"right\">","<img src=\"img/horg.gif\" alt=\"Horg\" title=\"Horg\" border=\"0\" width=\"300\" height=\"360\" style=\"text-align:right;\" align=\"right\">","<img src=\"grf/tsr_sm.png\" width=\"56\" height=\"59\" border=\"0\" alt=\"TSR\">"],"setting":"Spelljammer","statblock":{"Horg":{"Activity Cycle":"Any","Alignment":"Neutral Evil","Armor Class":"4","Climate/Terrain":"The Grinder","Damage/Attack":"1-8/2-20/2-20","Diet":"Carnivore","Frequency":"Very Rare","Hit Dice":"4+4","Intelligence":"Average ( 10)","Magic Resistance":"5%","Morale":"Fanatic (18)","Movement":"6, Fl 18 (B), also in a vacuum","No. Appearing":"3-18","No. of Attacks":"3","Organization":"War-bands","Size":"M (7')","Special Attacks":"Poison","Special Defenses":"See below","THAC0":"13","Treasure":"Individual: J, K, L, M, (B)","XP Value":"1,600"}},"title":"Horg"},"sources":["9374"],"statblock_names":[],"title":"Horg","prev_key":"hordling","next_key":"horgar","monster_path":"/appendix/horg"}},"staticQueryHashes":[],"slicesMap":{}}
