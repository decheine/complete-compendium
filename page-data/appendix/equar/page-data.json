While the powers listed above are the most common, some aarakocra have different or additional powers.</p><p class=\"f\">A race of intelligent, birdlike creatures living in the deepest deserts of Athas, the rare Athasian <a href=\"/appendix/aarakocr\">aarakocra</a> spends its time soaring on thermals in search of food.</p><p>The aarakocra is 7 to 8 feet tall with a wingspan of 20 feet or more. Because of its large wingspan, an aarakocra can carry as much as 75% of its own body weight and still fly easily. An aarakocra can fly a short distance carrying a burden equaling 125% of its own body weight. The average body weight of a full grown male is 100 pounds and a female is 85 pounds.</p><p>Each wing has a &ldquo;hand&rdquo; at its midpoint, consisting of three fingers and an opposable thumb. The fourth finger forms the rigid leading edge of the wing. In flight the hands cannot be used, but on the ground the aarakocra can use its hands almost as a human would. The aarakocra's body is protected by a thin bony plate on the chest, much like a solid rib cage. Talons on its legs can be used as claws and can be retracted to reveal a second set of hands, also with three fingers and an opposable thumb. Except for the chest plate, the entire skeleton is hollow and extremely fragile.</p><p>From a distance, the Athasian aarakocra resembles a huge <a href=\"/appendix/bird\">vulture</a>. Its black eyes, set in the front of the head, provide excellent vision over a long range. The plumage is generally black with a white collar for adult males and black or brown with a smaller white collar for females. Adolescents are a mixture of brown and black. The beak is large and covers most of the head. Plumage begins at the crown of the head and is darker near the head, except for the collar. Athasian aarakocra speak their own language and the languages of vultures and other large birds. Some speak the common tongue (5% to 10% chance depending on how deep in the wastelands a tribe lives).</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Combat:</b> Aarakocra can fight in the air or on the ground. They prefer aerial combat since their bones are too fragile to withstand a solid blow from a human-sized opponent. In combat against creatures on the ground, they prefer to fly over their victim and drop weighted nets. Some aarakocra use darts to harass ground-based opponents.</p><p>If their opponents can fly, the aarakocra generally forgo the use of the net, although large groups sometimes use nets on flying creatures. Normally, aarakocra attack flying creatures with long spears, diving from above and allowing the momentum to carry the spear through the target. Such an attack doubles the damage if the aarakocra have been able to dive at least 50 feet. Only the very largest aarakocra can carry more than one of these spears, they can attack with both at once with no penalty, causing double damage on each strike. All diving attacks are made at +4 and should be treated as a charge attack. All other penalties and restrictions of charge attacks apply.</p><p>The effect of the aarakocra's nets depends on if the opponent is flying at the time it becomes entangled. Creatures on the ground that are hit by a net are entangled and unable to participate in any combat until they make a successful Strength check to get free of the net. Flying creatures hit by a net can no longer fly and immediately begin falling. If they cannot escape the net or use some magical means to arrest the fall, normal falling damage applies.</p><p>Unless victims are entangled in nets, aarakocra are cautious in ground combat. If the aarakocra outnumber their opponents they advance in a straight line and thrust with their spears. If outnumbered, or the opponents are particularly tough, the aarakocra withdraw. Victims entangled in nets are killed or incapacitated for use as food or ransom.</p><p>Athasian aarakocra are mindful of their physical limitations as well as their comparatively low psionic abilities. They do not normally initiate psionic combat. At the first sign of psionic powers from any of their victims, however, all aarakocra that have some ability will use whatever attack and defense modes they can in an attempt to destroy the threat. Large groups of is or more aarakocra may initiate psionic combat if their leaders feel they can win quickly and avoid physical combat.</p><p>In desperation, an aarakocra can attempt to bite an opponent in combat. Because of the unwieldiness of its beak, the aarakocra has a THAC0 of 18 if attacking with this appendage. Further, the birdman causes only 1d2 points of damage with the beak.</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Habitat/Society:</b> Athasian aarakocra live in tribes with 6-20 (2d8+4) members, depending on the prestige of the leader. The largest tribe ever recorded had 50 members. The tribal hunting territory depends on the size of the tribe, usually about 500 square miles for a tribe of 10 members. There are no rigid boundaries between tribes and border disputes are not uncommon.</p><p>Alignments of tribe members are similar to the alignment of the leader. A tribe that has a leader who is neutral good may have neutral good, chaotic good, lawful good, and true neutral members. A predominantly evil tribe does not recognize boundaries with other tribes and treats other tribes as inferior beings to be eliminated.</p><p>Athasian aarakocra aren't happy in enclosed spaces, but they they take refuge in a cave or building if necessary.</p><p>Nonevil tribes live in rocky aeries in the highest peaks they can find. Evil tribes are normally nomadic and use an aerie made by another tribe if they need to remain in an area for a long time, even if they have to evict the tribe that made the nest.</p><p>Aarakocra aren't friendly toward intruders in their territory, especially caravans. They try to extract a toll from the caravan for passage through the desert. Good-aligned tribes allow unhindered passage of caravans that pay a tribute. If someone refuses to pay the tribute, the aarakocra try to capture scouts or outriders from the party and hold them until an even larger tribute is paid. The payment may be either livestock or shiny objects. Aarakocra are smart enough not to be taken in by glass baubles instead of gems, although they cannot tell the difference between the more common gems and the rare ones.</p><p>Evil tribes ask for tribute and often attack a caravan whether it pays or not. Aarakocra always demand shiny objects such as stones. These tribes find humans and demihumans to be quite tasty and prefer them to other food.</p><p>Good-aligned tribes of aarakocra sometimes return a lost traveler to the edge of the desert after first removing any valuables the traveler may be carrying. On very rare occasions a tribe might return a lost group of travelers to the more frequently traveled parts of the desert, again after first taking any valuables as payment.</p><p>The oldest male is the leader of the tribal hunting party and has 4+4 Hit Dice. The oldest female is in charge of the tribal aerie and has 3+3 HD. In tribes that have more than 15 members, the next oldest aarakocra serves as shaman and has 3+3 HD; the shaman completes the triumvirate necessary for proper worship and the summoning of elementals. (Interestingly, no magic-using aarakocra has ever been recorded.) Tribes without a shaman cannot summon <a href=\"/appendix/element1\">air elementals</a>, which is an important part of aarakocra culture.</p><p>The shaman is the leader of the daily sun worship. Aarakocra worship the sun because it provides them with the thermals they need to soar in search of food. The shaman also leads the mystic rituals used to summon an air elemental. Summoning an air elemental is usually done only in preparation for the tribe's most sacred ceremony, the hunt. Small tribes must band together for this ceremony to allow the triumvirate to be formed.</p><p>The ceremony to summon an air elemental must be conducted at dawn and requires the oldest male and female to emit a highpitched keening whistle. The shaman conducts an intricate dance around them, simultaneously chanting an ancient summoning mantra.</p><p>The hunt is the final part of the initiation of adolescent aarakocra to adulthood and often takes the tribe far from their normal teritory. The target is always a <a href=\"/appendix/drakalsi\">silt drake</a>. The hunt is the only time the females leave the relative safety of the nest. Even an evil tribe will not interfere with a tribe on a hunt. An air elemental is often summoned to help find the drake, but never takes part in the actual combat. Although the adult members of the tribe take part in the initial phases of the combat, it is the initiates who deliver the final, killing blows to me drake. Scars from the hunt are considered a mark of pride among all aarakocra.</p><p>The females spend about eight months of the year incubating their eggs. Athasian aarakocra mate for life and a pair normally produces as many as 10 offspring. A female lays one egg a year. Constant incubation is not required because of the high daytime temperatures, so the females can maintain the nest and keep the tribe's treasure in order.</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Ecology:</b> Athasian aarakocra are high on the food chain and have no natural enemies other than <a href=\"/appendix/drakatha\">drakes</a>. Unless evil, aarakocra leave their own territory only to hunt the silt drake and return as soon as possible when the hunt is over. (Evil aarakocra attack others, as noted above.) Aarakocra eggs and hatchlings are sought after by wealthy land owners who wish to use the creatures as scouts and sentries. An egg can bring as much as 10 cp in Tyr's marketplace. Tribes that have had eggs or hatchlings stolen have long memories and sometimes take revenge against the thief at a later date. Captive aarakocra join any tribe they come in contact with.</p><p>Athasian aarakocra have a natural life span of 21-30 years.</p>\n","images":["<img src=\"grf/ds.gif\" width=\"150\" height=\"75\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Dark Sun\" title=\"Dark Sun\" align=\"right\">","<img src=\"img/aarakath.gif\" alt=\"Aarakocra (Athas)\" title=\"Aarakocra (Athas)\" border=\"0\" width=\"300\" height=\"360\" style=\"text-align:right;\" align=\"right\">","<img src=\"grf/add2_01.gif\" width=\"200\" height=\"56\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Advanced Dungeons & Dragons 2nd Edition\">"],"setting":"Dark Sun","statblock":{"Aarakocra (Athas)":{"Activity Cycle":"Day","Alignment":"Any","Armor Class":"7","Climate/Terrain":"Deep desert","Damage/Attack":"1d3/1d3 or by weapon","Diet":"Carnivore","Frequency":"Rare","Hit Dice":"2+2","Intelligence":"Average (8-10)","Magic Resistance":"Nil","Morale":"Steady (11)","Movement":"6, Fl 36 (C)","No. Appearing":"1d10","No. of Attacks":"2","Organization":"Tribal","Size":"M (20'+ wingspan)","Special Attacks":"Nil","Special Defenses":"Nil","THAC0":"17","Treasure":"Varies","XP Value":"65"}},"title":"Aarakocra (Athas)"},"sources":["2433"],"statblock_names":[],"title":"Aarakocra (Athas)","prev_key":"zygraat","next_key":"aarakocr","monster_path":"/appendix/aarakath"}}},"pageContext":{"monster_key":"equar","monster_data":{"TSR":["Dragon243"],"fullBody":"  <table cellspacing=\"0\" cellpadding=\"0\"><tr class=\"bk\"><th> </th><th class=\"cn\">Lesser Equar</th><th class=\"cn\">Greater Equar</th></tr><tr><th>Climate/Terrain:</th>  <td>Any</td><td>Any</td></tr><tr><th>Frequency:</th>        <td>Very rare (rare)</td><td>Very rare (rare)</td></tr><tr><th>Organization:</th>     <td>Solitary (herds)</td><td>Solitary (herds)</td></tr><tr><th>Activity Cycle:</th>   <td>Diurnal (good-aligned); Nocturnal (evil-aligned); Any (neutral-aligned)</td><td>Any (all alignments)</td></tr><tr><th>Diet:</th>             <td>See below</td><td>See below</td></tr><tr><th>Intelligence:</th>     <td>Very to High (11-13)</td><td>Exceptional (15-16)</td></tr><tr><th>Treasure:</th>         <td>Nil</td><td>Nil</td></tr><tr><th>Alignment:</th>        <td>See below</td><td>See below</td></tr><tr><th>No. Appearing:</th>    <td>1 (3-8)</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><th>Armor Class:</th>      <td>3</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><th>Movement:</th>         <td>18</td><td>24</td></tr><tr><th>Hit Dice:</th>         <td>6</td><td>9</td></tr><tr><th>THAC0:</th>            <td>15</td><td>12</td></tr><tr><th>No. of Attacks:</th>   <td>2</td><td>2</td></tr><tr><th>Damage/Attack:</th>    <td>2-12/2-12</td><td>3-12/3-12</td></tr><tr><th>Special Attacks:</th>  <td>See below</td><td>See below</td></tr><tr><th>Special Defenses:</th> <td>See below</td><td>See below</td></tr><tr><th>Magic Resistance:</th> <td>Nil</td><td>20%</td></tr><tr><th>Size:</th>             <td>L</td><td>L</td></tr><tr><th>Morale:</th>           <td>Champion (15-16)</td><td>Fearless (20)</td></tr><tr><th>XP Value:</th>         <td></td><td></td></tr></table><p class=\"f\">The equar is a <a href=\"/appendix/horse\">horse</a>-like species native to the Outer Planes. Nine different breeds of equar have been recorded, and from time to time they are summoned to the Prime Material Plane to act as steeds and helpers to powerful individuals. An equar’s appearance and demeanor vary from type to type. Each is strongly aligned to the same ethos as its native plane. An equar can speak the Common tongue, its alignment language, and by means of the spell that summons it forth, the same racial language as the caster.</p><p>The spell to summon these creatures creates a pact between a rider (who need not be the caster) and the equar. Each promises to look after the welfare of the other. The equar agrees to aid the rider, who in turn pledges to provide the unique food the equar craves while upon the plane.</p><p>A lesser and greater equar are actually the same creature; the term designates how fully the creature exists on the Prime Material Plane. A lesser equar still has some of its essence upon its home plane, while the greater equar has been wholly conjured. Thus, any equar encountered upon its home plane is a greater equar</p><p>Riding an equar has its dangers. Should the steed be dispelled through magic or circumstance, it immediately gallops to its home plane—with the unfortunate rider still in the saddle. Also, a rider who has proved to be the ideal of the alignment of the equar might unwittingly convince the creature that he deserves to be taken back to the equar’s home plane. A protection from evil/good spell or equivalent effect prevents the equar from carrying the rider off-plane.</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Combat:</b> Equars can act as warhorses. All can be fierce in battle, attacking with their front hooves. Creatures of opposing alignment are always attacked first.</p><p>Equars have keen senses and are never surprised. They are immune to petrification, disease, and poison. Equars cannot be affected by charm or beguile spells or their variants. They are harmed only by magical weapons of +1 or greater enchantment.</p><p>An equar can gallop back to its home plane at will, but it might well take any rider with it, as mentioned above.</p><p>Each equar has an innate weakness as detailed in each individual’s description. The special vulnerability may not be known by its summoner; after all, such beasts rarely mention their weaknesses to anyone, even a well-known and respected individual. Some arcane tomes that contain the spell to summon the beasts might offer a hint. The more obvious weaknesses though, such as those of the trothspyre and charnalbalk, soon become apparent to a rider.</p><p>The spell-like abilities possessed by lesser equars operate at 9th-level ability; greater equars make use of their talents at 12th-level ability.</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Habitat/Society:</b> Equars tend to travel the wide open areas on their native plane. They roam in small herds of no more than ten, lead by the strongest stallion. Lawful equars mate for life. A foal is born only once every 20 years and requires six months of parental care as it learns to gallop and use its special abilities. An equar has a life span of about 100 years.</p><p>More powerful denizens of the Planes often seek out an equar to use as a steed. Not always is the creature willing to accept the rider. Often, in the case of the Lower Planes, a fiend captures and subdues an equar. Bards of many Planes tell of incidents in which a summoned equar was thus accidentally released from such service and then pursued to the Prime Material Plane by the infernal denizen.</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Ecology:</b> On their native plane, equars graze on the natural plant life, though the evil equars also hunt for meat. Like the horses they resemble, an equar consumes a great deal to keep up its stamina. Only on the Prime Material Plane are the creatures eating habits extreme and they require such special diets as gold or poison to maintain their magical link to their home plane.</p><h3>Trothspyre</h3><img src=\"/img/spc/equar1.gif\" style=\"float: right;\"/><p class=\"f\"><b>Lawful Good</b></p><p class=\"f\">The noble trothspyre is summoned from the verdant plains of Mount Celestia. Some sages have marked the resemblance between the trothspyre and the <a href=\"/appendix/unicorn\">unicorn</a>. Indeed, when seen from a distance, the two might be confused; but a trothspyre is markedly different from a unicorn, with crystalline hooves and a twisted horn rising from its brow. Some sages have commented that the horn is actually a symbol for the word “truth” in an archaic language. Evil creatures tend to avert their eyes, if possible, from the sight of the horn.</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Diet:</b> The trothspyre eats only the most fine and rare of grains, which must have been blessed by a lawful good priest; each such meal costs at least 50 gp. The creature will starve itself rather than eat mundane grains. The trothspyre must also spend at least four hours drinking in the sunlight every day to be sated. The trothspyre goes no more than two days without such a light-drinking before it views the pact with its rider null and void.</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Special Abilities:</b> Instead of trampling with its hooves, a trothspyre can impale an enemy upon its sharp horn, inflicting 1-10 hp damage (2-12 for a greater trothspyre). Any form of undead and any chaotic evil creature suffers double damage from the trothspyre’s horn attack.</p><p>A trothspyre can cast <i>know alignment</i> at will by touching an individual with its horn.</p><p>In addition to all common equar abilities, the trothspyre has the following spell-like powers:</p><p><i>Lesser</i>: A trothspyre can cast <i>detect lie</i> and <i>protection from evil</i> twice per day and can seal wounds with a touch of its horn. This action heals only 1 hp of damage, but the wound stops bleeding, even if the victim has been affected by a <i>sword of wounding</i> or similar effect.</p><p><i>Greater</i>: Trothyspyres can employ a <i>detect lie</i> spell on any creature within 20 feet unless the falsehood is hidden by an <i>undetectable lie</i> spell or similar effect. A touch of the creature’s horn seals wounds (as described above), and once per day the creature can cast <i>cure serious wounds</i>. A greater trothyspyre’s rider gains <i>protection from evil</i> while upon the equar’s back.</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Special Weakness:</b> A lesser trothspyre cannot exist on the Prime Material Plane after sundown. It slowly fades away, returning to its rider’s location (as long as the rider remains on the same plane) at daybreak. The greater trothspyre remains on the plane, to its chagrin, but its AC falls to 5, and the creature suffers a -1 penalty on all attack rolls until the next daybreak.</p><div style=\"border:thin solid #4169e1; margin:1em 1.5em 0; padding:.5em; float: right;\"><h4>The Paladin's Throthspyre</h4><p class=\"f\">Of the equars, only the lawful good trothspyre provides a suitable mount for the paladin. If the DM feels that the paladin has earned a special mount, he might allow a quest for a lesser or a greater trothspyre.</p><p>A paladin blessed with a lesser trothspyre warhorse receives a +1 bonus to Charisma while mounted atop the equar, and their combined aura is equivalent to a double-strength <i>protection from evil</i> spell. Attacks made by evil creatures against the paladin or his trothspyre suffer -4 penalties to attack rolls, and any saving throws caused by such attacks are made with +4 bonus.</p><p>In addition to the above powers, any paladin astride a greater trothspyre radiates a 30’ radius aura of bravery, affording himself and his nearby allies a +4 bonus to <i>fear</i>, <i>hopelessness</i>, <i>antipathy</i>, and <i>phantasmal killer</i> spells.</p><p>The pact between paladin and trothspyre is unbreakable for as long as the paladin remains a paragon of virtue. Should the paladin fall from grace, the trothspyre remains with its rider for as long as the paladin endeavors to redeem himself. If the paladin abandons his true calling, the trothspyre returns to its home plane in disgust.</p><p>A paladin who has remained honorable and faithful to his calling can coax his trothspyre steed into foregoing its usual diet in favor of a lesser meal if fine grains are unavailable, with the understanding that the equar will dine well when the opportunity presents itself. A trothspyre can live for months in this famished state but suffers a -1 penalty on attack rolls and saving throws (-2 for a greater equar) until fed well.</p><p>At any time, a paladin may heal his trothspyre’s hit points at the loss of his own. Similarly, a trothspyre may sacrifice any portion of its own hit points to heal its injured rider. The two must be in direct contact for this exchange to occur, and the one bestowing the hit points can never drop below 1 hp as a result of the transfer. Neither the trothspyre nor the paladin can heal others in this fashion; the exchange is limited to rider and mount</p></div><h3>Gildmane</h3><img src=\"/img/spc/equar2.gif\" style=\"float: right;\"/><p class=\"f\"><b>Neutral Good</b></p><p class=\"f\">A gildmane appears as a stout chestnut horse with a shimmering mane and hooves of pure gold that shine in the sun. equar lacks a tail. Legends claim that the first gildmane had a long flowing tail, but the creature angered a powerful fiend, causing havoc on the Prime Material Plane as it fled the demon’s wrath. The fiend chased the gildmane through the Astral Plane and across the spheres. In its fury, the fiend was heedless of the track the equar was taking. Thus the equar lead the fiend into the midst of Elysium, where it was slain by the denizens of that good Plane. Its final act was to grab hold of the gildmane’s long tail and tear it off. The equar rode on, and ever since then the gildmane has had no tail.</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Diet:</b> The gildmane’s peculiar diet demands worked gold (coins, jewelry, etc.), the purer the better. It consumes 200 gp value of the metal each day. Should it feast upon less for more than three days, the gildmane becomes surly and considers itself released from the pact, returning to Elysium.</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Special Abilities:</b> By touching a hoof to any suspect gold, the gildmane reveals the purity of the object: whether it is indeed gold or simply gold-painted iron or a lesser metal enchanted with the <i>fool’s gold</i> spell. A rider who knowingly supplies false gold to the equar voids the pact.</p><p>A gildmane can surround itself with a golden glow that provides light as per the <i>light</i> spell, and it offers a +1 on all saves for anyone within that 20’ radius against any form of curse or hex. Cursed magical items within this aura stand revealed for what they are and may be abandoned by their owners without fear of return, as if the proper spells (<i>remove curse</i>, <i>dispel magic</i>, etc.) or conditions necessary to lift the curse had been cast or met. This curse-breaking aura may be summoned but once per day and lasts for no more than one hour.</p><p>At any time, a gildmane can speak with an astral traveler by gently laying a hoof upon the creature’s body. Though the gildmane is said to have the gift to travel the Astral Plane, none has done so for centuries, perhaps fearing that the fiend that stole its tail still hunts it. Any attempt to take a gildmane into the Astral Plane is considered a breach of the pact.</p><p>In addition to all common equar abilities, the gildmane has the following spell-like powers:</p><p><i>Lesser</i>: The gildmane can grant good fortune to an individual, lending a bonus of +1 (on 1d20) or +5% on an single roll once per day. The equar an cast <i>glitterdust shield</i> (protecting both itself and rider), and <i>astral window</i>, each once per day.</p><p><i>Greater</i>: The gildmane can grant exceedingly good fortune to an individual, allowing either a +1 bonus for one turn to all rolls or a single +3 bonus to any single attempt, once per day. The equar can cast <i>glitterdust</i>, <i>shield</i>, and <i>astral window</i> all twice per day.</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Special Weakness:</b> Gildmanes attract the attention of evil creatures. Any and all monsters of Low intelligence (7) or lower must make a saving throw vs. spell every day while a gildmane is within one mile. Failure means that the evil creature is drawn to attack the equar and its rider when within range.</p><h3>Favonian</h3><img src=\"/img/spc/equar3.gif\" style=\"float: right;\"/><p class=\"f\"><b>Chaotic Good</b></p><p class=\"f\">Known to travel the open fields of Arborea, favonians are unafraid of the worst weather conditions. These equars consider the downpours of major storms as nothing more troubling than a spring shower. They are pale horses, bluish-white or dappled gray.</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Diet:</b> A favonian’s diet upon the Prime Material Plane is one of rain water and ancient sagas. Of all the equars, the favonian most enjoys the songs and antics of bards and entertainers, seeking out such company when the opportunity arises. Rain water can be collected in barrels or found in puddles after a sudden downpour. Far more difficult to find are the epic poems and songs that the equar demands be read or sung in its presence; usually such passages must be found in old libraries or copied from the epitaphs of barrows. Failure to provide the favonian’s food and drink for three consecutive days convinces the equar that the pact is broken, and it departs.</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Special Abilities:</b> A rider never falls off a favonian unless the equar wishes it; even at the most grueling pace or windy conditions, a favonian’s rider is safe from being ousted from the saddle. Favonians also leave no tracks on any surface.</p><p>The senses of a favonian are not hampered by heavy rain, fog, or mist of mundane or magical origin. When in such weather conditions, the equar can conjure 1-3 phantom steeds, as per the appear spell. These phantasms identical to the favonian and may be ridden as normal horses. They also act as a mirror image spell, distracting enemies’ attacks from the real favonian.</p><p>In addition to all common equar abilities, they have the following spell-like powers:</p><p><i>Lesser</i>: Favonians can cast <i>alter normal winds</i> (described in the Wizard's Spell Compendium [WSC]), gust of wind, and <i>obscurement</i> each once a day.</p><p><i>Greater</i>: Favonians can cast <i>alter normal winds</i> (WSC), <i>cloudburst</i> (WSC), <i>gust of wind</i>, and <i>obscurement</i> all thrice per day. The equar can perform a flying gallop thrice per day (MC B), lasting one turn, during which the equar moves at normal movement rate through the air, as per the <i>fly</i> spell.</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Special Weakness:</b> Because of their admiration (some say even love) for bards, these equars never attack an entertainer, even one of sinister disposition. In dealing with such persons, they’d rather disperse the crowd and deprive the rogue of his or her audience- and thus his or her livelihood. A favonian will come to an entertainer’s rescue, even when such action deviates from the desires of its rider. A favonian’s rider who attacks a bard or other entertainer learns that the favonian considers this action a breaking of the pact. The favonian sternly admonishes the offender before departing the plane.</p><h3>Lithicthil</h3><img src=\"/img/spc/equar4.gif\" style=\"float: right;\"/><p class=\"f\"><b>Lawful Neutral</b></p><p class=\"f\">The stalwart lithicthil rides through the open areas of Mechanus. At first glance, the lithicthil appears to be a living stone statue, but its flesh simply has an odd, sculpted look to it that resembles stone.</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Diet:</b> A lithicthil eats only worked materials—stone, wood, metal, clay, etc.—that have been enchanted in some way. Some are extremely finicky and eat only marble or wrought iron.</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Special Abilities:</b> Once per day, the lithicthil can increase any one attribute of its rider by 1-4 points (but not to exceed the racial maximum). The equar must be within 100 feet of the rider and often chooses itself which characteristic to augment; for example, a lithicthil who feels that its rider could treat it with more respect might choose to augment the rider’s Charisma, even if the rider would prefer an augmented Strength or Dexterity. The effect lasts five rounds for a lesser lithicthil, one turn for a greater. This equar can also detect enchantment at will, as per the detect magic spell, noting if an individual has been affected by any sort of spell from the School of Enchantment.</p><p>In addition to all common equar abilities, the lithicthil has the following spell-like powers:</p><p><i>Lesser</i>: The equar can cast <i>remove fear</i> once per day</p><p>Greater: The lithicthil can cast <i>remove fear</i> thrice a day and <i>meld into stone</i> (rider and equar both affected) once per day. The rider is immune to <i>fear</i> while astride the lithicthil.</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Special Weakness:</b> Exposure to random magic is detrimental to this equar. It suffers a -2 penalty on all saving throws against wild magic (and the greater lithicthil’s magic resistance does not apply to such dweomers), and any magical item that has random effects or powers (such as a <i>bag of beans</i> or a <i>wand of wonder</i>) will not function normally within 100 feet of an lithicthil; instead, the item will permanently drain itself of all magic to induce a wild surge (see <i>Tome of Magic</i>, page 7) within 100 feet of the equar, quite possibly affecting the item’s wielder along with the lithicthil, who—in addition to suffering the effects of the surge—also suffers 1-20 hp damage instantly.</p><h3>Menthric</h3><img src=\"/img/spc/equar5.gif\" style=\"float: right;\"/><p class=\"f\"><b>True Neutral</b></p><p class=\"f\">The menthric, native to The Outlands, appears as a normal horse and can have a variety of colors, from piebald to roan. But when seen out of the corner of the eye or with a <i>true seeing</i> spell or similar effect, the Menthric has the form of a plain-faced human dressed in non-descript clothing and shoulder-length hair. A perceptive person might notice that the menthric casts a human’s shadow rather than a horse’s This equar is often called upon when some event upsets the balance of power in the Prime Material Plane (for instance, during times of war, famine, and plague).</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Diet:</b> menthric must feed on enchanted script: magical scrolls, wizards’ spell books, and the like. Unfortunately, it is still vulnerable to any protective wards placed on the writing (such as <i>explosive runes</i>, <i>sepia snake sigil</i>, and the like), activated when the equar begins to eat. A menthric requires no less than four pages of magical script per day. If the equar must go for three days without this food, the pact is broken.</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Special Abilities:</b> A menthric has a talent for discerning weaknesses and strengths. If able to observe a creature for a full round, the equar can deduce whether the creature has any vulnerabilities or immunities. If the creature should have more than one special weakness or defense, the menthric can discover them with further scrutiny, learning one such trait per round. For instance, atop a hillcrest, a menthric and rider spy a horrid figure stumbling along the river bank. The menthric watches and notes that the creature favors its side, a sign of weakness. By waiting another round, the equar magically perceives that the wound was caused by fire and that flames are especially harmful to the monster. The forewarned rider readies a torch as they rush down to engage the troll.</p><p>A menthric can cast <i>analyze balance</i> and <i>detect magic</i> at will.</p><p>In addition to all common equar abilities, the menthric has the following spell-like powers:</p><p><i>Lesser</i>: The menthric can cast <i>hold portal</i>, <i>knock</i>, <i>mending</i>, and <i>shatter</i> once per day.</p><p><i>Greater</i>: The menthric can cast <i>hold portal</i>, <i>knock</i>, <i>mending</i>, and <i>shatter</i> twice per day. Once per day, the equar can summon a unique magical shield to protect both itself and rider. This effect takes the form of the opposing energy/ force that the attacker is using and thus only works against spells or magical effects. The menthric (and its rider) suffers only half damage from the attack, one-quarter if a saving throw is successful. Thus, if a red dragon breathed on a protected menthric employing its magical shield ability, most of the flames would be blocked by a suddenly appearing ring of ice and frost. The equar galloping through a blade barrier would be encircled by flying bucklers. This arcane shield lasts for one turn.</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Special Weakness:</b> A menthric is a creature of balance, prone neither to chaotic behavior (rash decisions) or lawful deliberation. It uses its own instinctive nature as a guide. However, spells that induce such state tend to wear at the creature’s ties to the Prime Material Plane. Thus any true chaotic or lawful magic—including Priest spells of the spheres Law and Chaos, and those wizard spells that either induce a disordered state (such as <i>chaos</i>, <i>Otto’s irresistible dance</i>, <i>polymorph other</i> or <i>unluck</i>) or rigid state (such as <i>domination</i> or <i>hold monster</i>) have a 5% chance per level of the spell of driving the equar back to its home plane. This risk occurs only if the menthric fails any magic resistance and saving throw rolls. Unfortunately, the rider of a banished menthric is also sent with the equar.</p><h3>Potherrounce</h3><img src=\"/img/spc/equar6.gif\" style=\"float: right;\"/><p class=\"f\"><b>Chaotic Neutral</b></p><p class=\"f\">The potherrounce is a creature of true chaos, native to the wilds of Limbo. Though always a horse in basic form, it has no true appearance; every time one looks at a potherrounce, one sees something different. Thus, the first glance might show a zebra, while the next a draft horse with a mane of flower petals, and the next glance a dappled mare with three tails. This effect can be quite disconcerting, and superstitious folk intensely dislike and distrust this equar and any who associate with it.</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Diet:</b> Being borne from the forces of chaos, the potherrounce hungers for food similar in nature. Upon the Prime Material Plane, the only meals it eats are mixed magical potions (unmixed vials are unappealing to the equar; see Table 111 in the DUNGEON MASTER® Guide for the effects of mixing potions). Since the potherrounce demands fresh concoctions, the resulting mix can be quite volatile, and explosions have sometimes resulted in the demise of the rider. Still, the potherrounce laps up the strange brew. Failure to provide a drink of at least three different potions blended together once a week convinces the equar that the pact is broken.</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Special Abilities:</b> Because of its natural environs, the potherrounce’s magic resistance is effectively doubled against wild magic and surges. Also, a potherrounce’s senses are constantly <i>patternweaving</i> (see the Tome of Magic [TOM]). Thus the equar is unaffected by such spells as <i>blur</i>, <i>chaos</i>, <i>confuse languages</i>, <i>confusion</i>, <i>fool’s speech</i>, the reverse of <i>tongues</i>, and the like.</p><p>In addition to all common equar abilities, the potherrounce has the following spell-like powers:</p><p><i>Lesser</i>: A potherrounce can cast <i>blink</i>, affecting both it and rider, three times per day. The rider is continually protected as by a <i>chaos shield</i> (TOM) while mounted on the equar.</p><p><i>Greater</i>: The potherrounce can cast <i>miscast magic</i> (TOM) once per day. The rider gains more protection from wild magic, sharing the equar’s enhanced magic resistance against such dweomers. The potherrounce can urn ethereal with its rider for up to one hour each day. Because of the shifting appearance of the potherrounce, anyone with a full day’s exposure to the creature must make a saving throw vs. spell or lose 1 point of Wisdom. Should such an attribute fall to 0 through time spent in the equar’s presence, the individual goes permanently insane (until a <i>restoration</i> or <i>limited wish</i> spell is applied). Lost Wisdom is regained at the rate of 1 point per week spent away from the potherrounce.</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Special Weakness:</b> Any missile weapon blessed by a lawfully aligned priest inflicts double damage to a potherrounce. The equar attempts to retreat from such attacks if at all possible, even if its rider demands otherwise. <i>Hold</i> spells and other forms of paralysis inflict 1-3 hp damage per round on the potherrounce in addition to their usual effects, as the equar cannot freely shift its appearance under such effects.</p><h3>Banecourser</h3><img src=\"/img/spc/equar7.gif\" style=\"float: right;\"/><p class=\"f\"><b>Lawful Evil</b></p><p class=\"f\">For villains, the banecourser is a grand mount. At first glance it appears to be nothing more than a fine black steed. Close inspection reveals its vile nature. Then one might see the odd streaks of rust and verdigris along its coat. When the equar opens its mouth, a serpentine tongue slips out for snake-like flicker. This equar dwells on the awful moors of Baator, but it is more than eager to appear on the Prime Material Plane and work with evil riders. Moonlight never illuminates a banecourser, and observation of this uncanny effect is one of the means to uncover the true nature of beast.</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Diet:</b> The banecourser must feed on deadly poisons. Many a rider has perished from accidental exposure to the venom gathered for the equar. The equar requires an average of 50 gp of such poisons per day, or else the pact is broken.</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Special Abilities:</b> The banecourser can <i>detect poison</i> by smell. With its flickering tongue, the creature can actually drain poison from any creature. This venom-theft can be performed upon a beast that has poison glands or sacs, thereby robbing it of such an attack. It can even remove the venom from a poison victim’s system, perhaps inadvertently saving a life in the process. To employ this special attack, the equar must first successful strike the target. Thereafter, it draws out the poison over the course of a number of rounds equal to the Hit Dice of a venomous creature or 2-7 rounds for a poisoned individual (who might well die before the poison is all removed). Each round the banecourser spends draining the poison, the target suffers 1 hp damage from the sharp tongue’s lapping.</p><p>Banecoursers have 60’ infravision but are irritated by daylight, suffering a -2 penalty on all rolls under such light, including the effects of a <i>light</i> spell or similarly bright illumination. This rider shares both the infravision and the sensitivity to light, unless wearing a helm, hat, or other apparatus to shield the eyes from direct light.</p><p>Interestingly, all creatures encountering the rider while he or she is in physical contact with the banecourser are affected as by a <i>friends</i> spell, with no saving throw allowed.</p><p>In addition to all common equar abilities, the banecourser has the following spell-like powers:</p><p><i>Lesser</i>: The banecourser allows the rider’s words to act as a <i>suggestion</i> spell once per day.</p><p><i>Greater</i>: The equar can cast <i>suggestion</i> and <i>undetectable lie</i> upon one of the rider’s statements once per day, with listeners suffering a -2 to saves to detect the lie. The rider is afforded <i>protection from good</i> while astride the banecourser.</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Special Weakness:</b> Banecoursers were cursed long ago by the goddess of the moon, as punishment for the equars’ taking part in the destruction of her high temple. Ever since, the banecourser has been unable to cross a line of silver (the metal sacred to the goddess). Though silver inflicts no harm to the equar, it irritates the equar; if the banecourser becomes trapped by a circle of silver, it departs the plane, the pact broken.</p><p>Due to the equar’s diet, a <i>slow poison</i> spell cast upon a banecourser acts as a <i>slow</i> spell, while a <i>neutralize poison</i> inflicts 4d6 hp damage. A <i>periapt of proof against poison</i>, if bound to a banecourser, forces the creature back to Baator for a period no less than one year.</p><h3>Rosinante</h3><img src=\"/img/spc/equar8.gif\" style=\"float: right;\"/><p class=\"f\"><b>Neutral Evil</b></p><p class=\"f\">Though bards praise the melodious name of this equar, truly nothing about this creature hailing from The Gray Waste is the least bit lovely. A rosinante has the appearance of sickly, hairless horse with long rat’s tail. The eyes are unnaturally large and without pupils, looking like dead-white orbs. The rosinante’s teeth are crooked and small.</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Diet:</b> This equar dines only upon rotten meat and tainted water, and it insists on being hand-fed.</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Special Abilities:</b> Instead of its hooves, a rosinante can attack a foe with its prehensile tail. This attack can take the form of whipping that inflicts 1-4 hp damage (2-5 for a greater rosinante), or it can grasp a single-handed melee weapon. The lesser rosinante may wield weapons of S size, while a greater rosinante may employ M-sized weapons.</p><p>This equar can <i>detect good</i> at will through a magical sense of smell. The equar is also immune to the effects of a <i>stinking cloud</i>. They can see as well at night as they do at day.</p><p>In addition to all common equar abilities, the rosinante has the following spell-like powers:</p><p><i>Lesser</i>: The rosinante can summon a swarm of verminous rats (as per the second-level Wizard spell <i>summon swarm</i>) up to twice a day. When necessary, the rosinante can Move Silently (60%) and Hide in Shadows (70%), even when ridden.</p><p><i>Greater</i>: While riderless, this equar can shapeshift into a giant rat once per day and slip through small openings no less than one foot wide. The creature may also summon 1-3 <a href=\"/appendix/rat\">giant rats</a> once per day to aid its cause. Such creatures are under the complete control of the rosinante with no need for the equar to concentrate to keep the beasts in line. Note that the area where the rats are summoned must be hospitable to such rodents, or else none can be called. When necessary, the greater rosinante can Move Silently (80%) and Hide in Shadows (90%) as a thief, even while ridden.</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Special Weakness:</b> Restorative magic cast upon the rosinante actually harms the creature. Thus a <i>cure light wounds</i> inflicts 1-8 hp damage, a <i>cure disease</i> inflicts a disease, and so forth. A rosinante can be healed only by eating victuals affected by <i>putrefy food and drink</i> spell, regaining 1-8 hp per helping.</p><h3>Charnalbalk</h3><img src=\"/img/spc/equar9.gif\" style=\"float: right;\"/><p class=\"f\"><b>Chaotic Evil</b></p><p class=\"f\">Straight from the Abyss, the charnalbalk appears as an emaciated coal black horse with iron hooves. Its mane is tangled and unkempt. When a foal matures, the evil powers of the Abyss forge a terrifying iron mask and bolt it on the creature’s head; smoldering eyes glow from slits in the helm. The jaws of the beast stretch wide and are lined with sharp teeth and a pair of boar-like tusks.</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Diet:</b> The charnalbalk demands blood and warm flesh to dine upon, but such a meal must be from the same racial stock as the rider; sages suggest that this equar secretly harbors ill will toward any who dare ride it and thus chooses such as its diet, One victim slaughtered per day keeps the charnalbalk content. One such meal every three days keeps the pact of the spell, though the beast may at an inconvenient time attack a member of that race (other than the rider) to snack upon in the meantime.</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Special Abilities:</b> Instead of fighting with its hooves, a charnalbalk can bite an enemy with its daggerlike teeth, inflicting 2-8 hp damage (3-12 for a greater charnalbalk). If the beast scores a natural roll of “20,” it succeeds in tearing loose a hunk of flesh, thereby causing further 2-8 (3-12) hp damage; whether the wound is healed through natural or magical means, the strike always leaves a nasty scar.</p><p>Charnalbalks have 120’ infravision and can cause the spell-like effects <i>fear</i> and <i>weakness</i> (the reverse of strength) for one hour in any creature below 3rd level or 3 HD that meet its gaze. A successful saving throw negates this effect.</p><p>In addition to all common equar abilities, they have the following spelllike powers:</p><p><i>Lesser</i>: The equar can cast <i>invisibility to undead</i> (affecting both itself and its rider) and <i>heat metal</i> each once per day.</p><p><i>Greater</i>: The equar can cast <i>invisibility to undead</i> (affecting both itself and its rider) and<i> heat metal</i> each thrice per day. It can also cast <i>animate dead</i> once per day, but only corpses killed by the charnalbalk can be animated.</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Special Weakness:</b> A lesser charnalbalk cannot exist on the Prime Material Plane after sunrise. It slowly fades away at dawn, returning to its rider’s location at dusk. The greater charnalbalk remains on the plane, to its great annoyance, but its AC falls to 5, and the creature suffers a -1 penalty on all d20 rolls.</p><div style=\"border:thin solid #4169e1; margin:1em 1.5em 0; padding:.5em;\"><h3>New Magical Item</h3><h4>The Saddles of Ahl Mitac</h4><p class=\"f\">The conjurer Ahl Mitac was known throughout the world not so much for his tremendous magical prowess but for his many beloved daughters. When suitors began to visit the conjurer’s estate, Ahl Mitac decided to create a wondrous dowry for each child—a gift that not only would be valued for its worth but also could bring back swiftly any daughter who found her husband unkind. After many days of toil with local craftsman and countless nights spent consulting Planar charts, Ahl Mitac cast a dweomer upon several of the most finely-wrought saddles. Legend marks their number at seven, but some bards sing that there are as many as 13 enchanted saddles. (Some sages point out that the number changes frequently, depending on the length of the song the bard wishes to sing.)</p><p>Whenever any woman sits atop a <i>saddle of Ahl Mitac</i> (even if the saddle does not rest on a mount), an equar of the same alignment is instantly summoned as her steed. A pact can then be arranged between the rider and the equar. If at the time of the summoning a normal horse had been wearing the saddle, the equar interplanarly changes places with the animal.</p><p><b>XP Value:</b> 1,000 <b>GP Value:</b> 5,000</p></div><div style=\"border:thin solid #4169e1; margin: 1em 1.5em 0; padding:.5em;\"><h3>New Spells</h3><h4>Summon Lesser Equar</h4><table cellspacing=\"0\" cellpadding=\"0\"><tr><td>(Conjuration/Summoning)</td></tr><tr><td>Level: 5</td></tr><tr><td>Range: 50 yds.</td></tr><tr><td>Components: V, S, M</td></tr><tr><td>Casting Time: 5</td></tr><tr><td>Duration: 1 day/level of caster</td></tr><tr><td>Area of Effect: Summons 1 equar</td></tr><tr><td>Saving Throw: None</td></tr></table><p class=\"f\">This caster of this spell summons an equar from one of the Outer Planes. Before the creature agrees to assist the caster and take a rider, a pact must first be struck. The wording is not as important as the understanding (though some tomes suggest otherwise). In return for caring and feeding the equar, the beast agrees to serve the caster in a single endeavor for a period not longer than the spell’s duration. A rider must also be designated, though this need not be the caster. There are conditions in which an equar will feel that the pact has been broken. If it is improperly fed, betrayed to an opposite alignment, or attacked by the rider or caster, it will swiftly return to its home plane. The next time the conjurer attempts to summon an equar, he may well have to make amends for the spell to work.</p><p>A conjurer can call upon only an equar of the same alignment. No evil mage can ever summon one of the good equars, for instance. However, an equar will accept a rider with an alignment close to its own, but the mount might prove demanding and critical of any action it deems offensive. For example, a trothspyre might consent to bear a neutral good or lawful neutral rider, but the steed will extol the ways of virtue and ensure that its rider commits no evil.</p><p>The material component is an offering of food to the taste of the summoned equar. Only those that have first mastered the incantations for <i>mount</i> and <i>monster summoning I</i> can learn this spell.</p><h4>Summon Greater Equar</h4><table cellspacing=\"0\" cellpadding=\"0\"><tr><td>(Conjuration/Summoning)</td></tr><tr><td>Level: 7</td></tr><tr><td>Range: 50 yds.</td></tr><tr><td>Components: V, S, M</td></tr><tr><td>Casting Time: 7</td></tr><tr><td>Duration: 1 day/level of caster</td></tr><tr><td>Area of Effect: Summons 1 equar</td></tr><tr><td>Saving Throw: None</td></tr></table><p class=\"f\">This spell is similar to <i>summon lesser equar</i>, and the conjurer must have knowledge of that spell before learning this one. This version creates a more powerful call to the equar. The beast is more firmly bound to the Prime Material and thus has the statistics of a greater equar. In all other ways, this spell resembles the above.</p><p></p></div><p><br/></p><p><i>by Steve Berman</i></p>\n","images":["<img src=\"grf/dr.gif\" width=\"150\" height=\"75\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Dragon Magazine\" title=\"Dragon Magazine\" align=\"right\">","<img src=\"/img/spc/equar1.gif\" style=\"float: right;\"/>","<img src=\"/img/spc/equar2.gif\" style=\"float: right;\"/>","<img src=\"/img/spc/equar3.gif\" style=\"float: right;\"/>","<img src=\"/img/spc/equar4.gif\" style=\"float: right;\"/>","<img src=\"/img/spc/equar5.gif\" style=\"float: right;\"/>","<img src=\"/img/spc/equar6.gif\" style=\"float: right;\"/>","<img src=\"/img/spc/equar7.gif\" style=\"float: right;\"/>","<img src=\"/img/spc/equar8.gif\" style=\"float: right;\"/>","<img src=\"/img/spc/equar9.gif\" style=\"float: right;\"/>","<img src=\"grf/tsr_sm.png\" width=\"56\" height=\"59\" border=\"0\" alt=\"TSR\">"],"setting":"Dragon Magazine","statblock":{"Greater Equar":{"Activity Cycle":"Any (all alignments)","Alignment":"See below","Armor Class":"1","Climate/Terrain":"Any","Damage/Attack":"3-12/3-12","Diet":"See below","Frequency":"Very rare (rare)","Hit Dice":"9","Intelligence":"Exceptional (15-16)","Magic Resistance":"20%","Morale":"Fearless (20)","Movement":"24","No. Appearing":"1","No. of Attacks":"2","Organization":"Solitary (herds)","Size":"L","Special Attacks":"See below","Special Defenses":"See below","THAC0":"12","Treasure":"Nil","XP Value":""},"Lesser Equar":{"Activity Cycle":"Diurnal (good-aligned); Nocturnal (evil-aligned); Any (neutral-aligned)","Alignment":"See below","Armor Class":"3","Climate/Terrain":"Any","Damage/Attack":"2-12/2-12","Diet":"See below","Frequency":"Very rare (rare)","Hit Dice":"6","Intelligence":"Very to High (11-13)","Magic Resistance":"Nil","Morale":"Champion (15-16)","Movement":"18","No. Appearing":"1 (3-8)","No. of Attacks":"2","Organization":"Solitary (herds)","Size":"L","Special Attacks":"See below","Special Defenses":"See below","THAC0":"15","Treasure":"Nil","XP Value":""}},"title":"Equar"},"sources":["Dragon243"],"statblock_names":[],"title":"Equar","prev_key":"ephemera","next_key":"erdland","monster_path":"/appendix/equar"}},"staticQueryHashes":[],"slicesMap":{}}
