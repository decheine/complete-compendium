While the powers listed above are the most common, some aarakocra have different or additional powers.</p><p class=\"f\">A race of intelligent, birdlike creatures living in the deepest deserts of Athas, the rare Athasian <a href=\"/appendix/aarakocr\">aarakocra</a> spends its time soaring on thermals in search of food.</p><p>The aarakocra is 7 to 8 feet tall with a wingspan of 20 feet or more. Because of its large wingspan, an aarakocra can carry as much as 75% of its own body weight and still fly easily. An aarakocra can fly a short distance carrying a burden equaling 125% of its own body weight. The average body weight of a full grown male is 100 pounds and a female is 85 pounds.</p><p>Each wing has a &ldquo;hand&rdquo; at its midpoint, consisting of three fingers and an opposable thumb. The fourth finger forms the rigid leading edge of the wing. In flight the hands cannot be used, but on the ground the aarakocra can use its hands almost as a human would. The aarakocra's body is protected by a thin bony plate on the chest, much like a solid rib cage. Talons on its legs can be used as claws and can be retracted to reveal a second set of hands, also with three fingers and an opposable thumb. Except for the chest plate, the entire skeleton is hollow and extremely fragile.</p><p>From a distance, the Athasian aarakocra resembles a huge <a href=\"/appendix/bird\">vulture</a>. Its black eyes, set in the front of the head, provide excellent vision over a long range. The plumage is generally black with a white collar for adult males and black or brown with a smaller white collar for females. Adolescents are a mixture of brown and black. The beak is large and covers most of the head. Plumage begins at the crown of the head and is darker near the head, except for the collar. Athasian aarakocra speak their own language and the languages of vultures and other large birds. Some speak the common tongue (5% to 10% chance depending on how deep in the wastelands a tribe lives).</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Combat:</b> Aarakocra can fight in the air or on the ground. They prefer aerial combat since their bones are too fragile to withstand a solid blow from a human-sized opponent. In combat against creatures on the ground, they prefer to fly over their victim and drop weighted nets. Some aarakocra use darts to harass ground-based opponents.</p><p>If their opponents can fly, the aarakocra generally forgo the use of the net, although large groups sometimes use nets on flying creatures. Normally, aarakocra attack flying creatures with long spears, diving from above and allowing the momentum to carry the spear through the target. Such an attack doubles the damage if the aarakocra have been able to dive at least 50 feet. Only the very largest aarakocra can carry more than one of these spears, they can attack with both at once with no penalty, causing double damage on each strike. All diving attacks are made at +4 and should be treated as a charge attack. All other penalties and restrictions of charge attacks apply.</p><p>The effect of the aarakocra's nets depends on if the opponent is flying at the time it becomes entangled. Creatures on the ground that are hit by a net are entangled and unable to participate in any combat until they make a successful Strength check to get free of the net. Flying creatures hit by a net can no longer fly and immediately begin falling. If they cannot escape the net or use some magical means to arrest the fall, normal falling damage applies.</p><p>Unless victims are entangled in nets, aarakocra are cautious in ground combat. If the aarakocra outnumber their opponents they advance in a straight line and thrust with their spears. If outnumbered, or the opponents are particularly tough, the aarakocra withdraw. Victims entangled in nets are killed or incapacitated for use as food or ransom.</p><p>Athasian aarakocra are mindful of their physical limitations as well as their comparatively low psionic abilities. They do not normally initiate psionic combat. At the first sign of psionic powers from any of their victims, however, all aarakocra that have some ability will use whatever attack and defense modes they can in an attempt to destroy the threat. Large groups of is or more aarakocra may initiate psionic combat if their leaders feel they can win quickly and avoid physical combat.</p><p>In desperation, an aarakocra can attempt to bite an opponent in combat. Because of the unwieldiness of its beak, the aarakocra has a THAC0 of 18 if attacking with this appendage. Further, the birdman causes only 1d2 points of damage with the beak.</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Habitat/Society:</b> Athasian aarakocra live in tribes with 6-20 (2d8+4) members, depending on the prestige of the leader. The largest tribe ever recorded had 50 members. The tribal hunting territory depends on the size of the tribe, usually about 500 square miles for a tribe of 10 members. There are no rigid boundaries between tribes and border disputes are not uncommon.</p><p>Alignments of tribe members are similar to the alignment of the leader. A tribe that has a leader who is neutral good may have neutral good, chaotic good, lawful good, and true neutral members. A predominantly evil tribe does not recognize boundaries with other tribes and treats other tribes as inferior beings to be eliminated.</p><p>Athasian aarakocra aren't happy in enclosed spaces, but they they take refuge in a cave or building if necessary.</p><p>Nonevil tribes live in rocky aeries in the highest peaks they can find. Evil tribes are normally nomadic and use an aerie made by another tribe if they need to remain in an area for a long time, even if they have to evict the tribe that made the nest.</p><p>Aarakocra aren't friendly toward intruders in their territory, especially caravans. They try to extract a toll from the caravan for passage through the desert. Good-aligned tribes allow unhindered passage of caravans that pay a tribute. If someone refuses to pay the tribute, the aarakocra try to capture scouts or outriders from the party and hold them until an even larger tribute is paid. The payment may be either livestock or shiny objects. Aarakocra are smart enough not to be taken in by glass baubles instead of gems, although they cannot tell the difference between the more common gems and the rare ones.</p><p>Evil tribes ask for tribute and often attack a caravan whether it pays or not. Aarakocra always demand shiny objects such as stones. These tribes find humans and demihumans to be quite tasty and prefer them to other food.</p><p>Good-aligned tribes of aarakocra sometimes return a lost traveler to the edge of the desert after first removing any valuables the traveler may be carrying. On very rare occasions a tribe might return a lost group of travelers to the more frequently traveled parts of the desert, again after first taking any valuables as payment.</p><p>The oldest male is the leader of the tribal hunting party and has 4+4 Hit Dice. The oldest female is in charge of the tribal aerie and has 3+3 HD. In tribes that have more than 15 members, the next oldest aarakocra serves as shaman and has 3+3 HD; the shaman completes the triumvirate necessary for proper worship and the summoning of elementals. (Interestingly, no magic-using aarakocra has ever been recorded.) Tribes without a shaman cannot summon <a href=\"/appendix/element1\">air elementals</a>, which is an important part of aarakocra culture.</p><p>The shaman is the leader of the daily sun worship. Aarakocra worship the sun because it provides them with the thermals they need to soar in search of food. The shaman also leads the mystic rituals used to summon an air elemental. Summoning an air elemental is usually done only in preparation for the tribe's most sacred ceremony, the hunt. Small tribes must band together for this ceremony to allow the triumvirate to be formed.</p><p>The ceremony to summon an air elemental must be conducted at dawn and requires the oldest male and female to emit a highpitched keening whistle. The shaman conducts an intricate dance around them, simultaneously chanting an ancient summoning mantra.</p><p>The hunt is the final part of the initiation of adolescent aarakocra to adulthood and often takes the tribe far from their normal teritory. The target is always a <a href=\"/appendix/drakalsi\">silt drake</a>. The hunt is the only time the females leave the relative safety of the nest. Even an evil tribe will not interfere with a tribe on a hunt. An air elemental is often summoned to help find the drake, but never takes part in the actual combat. Although the adult members of the tribe take part in the initial phases of the combat, it is the initiates who deliver the final, killing blows to me drake. Scars from the hunt are considered a mark of pride among all aarakocra.</p><p>The females spend about eight months of the year incubating their eggs. Athasian aarakocra mate for life and a pair normally produces as many as 10 offspring. A female lays one egg a year. Constant incubation is not required because of the high daytime temperatures, so the females can maintain the nest and keep the tribe's treasure in order.</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Ecology:</b> Athasian aarakocra are high on the food chain and have no natural enemies other than <a href=\"/appendix/drakatha\">drakes</a>. Unless evil, aarakocra leave their own territory only to hunt the silt drake and return as soon as possible when the hunt is over. (Evil aarakocra attack others, as noted above.) Aarakocra eggs and hatchlings are sought after by wealthy land owners who wish to use the creatures as scouts and sentries. An egg can bring as much as 10 cp in Tyr's marketplace. Tribes that have had eggs or hatchlings stolen have long memories and sometimes take revenge against the thief at a later date. Captive aarakocra join any tribe they come in contact with.</p><p>Athasian aarakocra have a natural life span of 21-30 years.</p><br clear=\"all\" style=\"clear:both; height:0;\">\r\n","images":["<img src=\"grf/ds.gif\" width=\"150\" height=\"75\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Dark Sun\" title=\"Dark Sun\" align=\"right\">","<img src=\"img/aarakath.gif\" alt=\"Aarakocra (Athas)\" title=\"Aarakocra (Athas)\" border=\"0\" width=\"300\" height=\"360\" style=\"text-align:right;\" align=\"right\">","<img src=\"grf/add2_01.gif\" width=\"200\" height=\"56\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Advanced Dungeons & Dragons 2nd Edition\">"],"setting":"Dark Sun","statblock":{"Aarakocra (Athas)":{"Activity Cycle":"Day","Alignment":"Any","Armor Class":"7","Climate/Terrain":"Deep desert","Damage/Attack":"1d3/1d3 or by weapon","Diet":"Carnivore","Frequency":"Rare","Hit Dice":"2+2","Intelligence":"Average (8-10)","Magic Resistance":"Nil","Morale":"Steady (11)","Movement":"6, Fl 36 (C)","No. Appearing":"1d10","No. of Attacks":"2","Organization":"Tribal","Size":"M (20'+ wingspan)","Special Attacks":"Nil","Special Defenses":"Nil","THAC0":"17","Treasure":"Varies","XP Value":"65"}},"title":"Aarakocra (Athas)"},"sources":["2433"],"statblock_names":[],"title":"Aarakocra (Athas)","prev_key":"zygraat","next_key":"aarakocr","monster_path":"/appendix/aarakath"}}},"pageContext":{"monster_key":"kalmari","monster_data":{"TSR":["9552"],"fullBody":"  <table cellspacing=\"0\" cellpadding=\"0\"><tr><th>Climate/Terrain:</th>  <td>Any</td></tr><tr><th>Frequency:</th>        <td>Very rare: Rare in Acheron</td></tr><tr><th>Organization:</th>     <td>Solitary</td></tr><tr><th>Activity Cycle:</th>   <td>Any</td></tr><tr><th>Diet:</th>             <td>Carnivore</td></tr><tr><th>Intelligence:</th>     <td>Average</td></tr><tr><th>Treasure:</th>         <td>Nil</td></tr><tr><th>Alignment:</th>        <td>Lawful evil</td></tr><tr><th>No. Appearing:</th>    <td>1</td></tr><tr><th>Armor Class:</th>      <td>-6</td></tr><tr><th>Movement:</th>         <td>6</td></tr><tr><th>Hit Dice:</th>         <td>3+3</td></tr><tr><th>THAC0:</th>            <td>17</td></tr><tr><th>No. of Attacks:</th>   <td>2</td></tr><tr><th>Damage/Attack:</th>    <td>1d10/1d6</td></tr><tr><th>Special Attacks:</th>  <td>Swallow, entangle</td></tr><tr><th>Special Defenses:</th> <td>+2 or better weapons to hit; Slain only by consumed & rejected magical item</td></tr><tr><th>Magic Resistance:</th> <td>100%</td></tr><tr><th>Size:</th>             <td>M</td></tr><tr><th>Morale:</th>           <td>Champion (16)</td></tr><tr><th>XP Value:</th>         <td>2,000</td></tr></table><p class=\"f\">In its natural state, a kalmari is an amorphous being with a smoky, mistlike consistency. It appears as an inverted teardrop, with a 3'-long prehensile tail. The beast has two unblinking yellow eyes that it can move to different parts of its surface in order to follow multiple foes. The most striking feature of the kalmari, however, is its inordinately large, tooth-filled maws which seem to stretch all the way around its body. When the creature opens wide its jaws, the mouth appears to cover the majority of the kalmari's body. The kalmari also can possess the body of a living being without affecting that being's appearanc</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Combat:</b> A bite from the kalmari's jaws inflicts 1d10 points of damage and the tail can whip a target for ld6 points of damage. When a natural 20 results from the tail's attack roll, no damage is done but the victim is entangled. An entangled victim is allowed one Bend Bars/Lift Gates roll to escape; otherwise only severing the tail itself by inflicting 10 points of damage there on a called shot (see the DMG for details) frees the entangled victim.</p><p>The kalmari's most fearsome ability is that, on any attack roll (for the creature's mouth) that is 4 or more higher than the number required to hit that target, the target is swallowed whole. For instance, if the kalmari needed to roll a 12 or better to hit a target, any natural roll of 16 or greater would mean that the target had been swallowed whole by the creature. Swallowed creatures will be digested in a number of rounds equal to their experience level/Hit Dice. Swallowed victims are helpless. After this time, the victim is gone forever and cannot be raised or resurrected. The kalmari will not attempt to swallow a second target until the first victim is dead.</p><p>The kalmari can be struck only by +2 or better magical weapons and is 100% immune to spells. While sufficiently enchanted weapons can damage the beast, even they cannot kill it. If reduced to 0 hp by such weapons, the kalmari is simply banished back to its home plane of Acheron - bearing a great grudge against those who sent it home against its will.</p><p>The only vulnerability a kalmari possesses is that it cannot digest magic in any form. This is related to its immunity to magic spells; the nature of the beast and the nature of magic in the Realms are simply incompatible. All magical items worn or carried by a victim the kalmari has swallowed are regurgitated by the beast the round after ingestion. Offensive magical items such as weapons, wands, staves, and so on are then capable of damaging and destroying the beast regardless of their enchantment. Weapons are granted an additional +2 bonus both to attack and damage rolls vs. the creature and the spell-like effects of wands, rods, staves, rings, etc., now inflict damage on the kalmari normally; the beast's Magic Resistance no longer applies to those items. If, for example, the kalmari ingests and rejects a <i>wand of fire</i>, <i>fireballs</i> from that item can kill the kalmari. Fireballs from any source other than that <i>wand</i> still do not harm the creature.</p><p>Note that any items swallowed and rejected by one kalmari do not gain these benefits against any other members of the species.</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Habitat/Society:</b> Little is known of the habits of the creature on its home plane, but in the Realms a kalmari is normally summoned by a mage to act as a guard for some important item, person, or place.</p><p>To remain on this plane or an extended period of time (see Ecology below), a kalmari must have a body composed of material native to the plane. This material can be either a living being or an inanimate vessel that allows the creature movement and a means to manifest its jaws and eyes. A kalmari within a host body can exist in the Realms indefinitely, but once the creature leaves a host, it has only 10 minutes to find another or be compelled to return to Acheron. A host body retains its normal Armor Class, but can withstand only 10 hit points of damage before it is rent asunder as the kalmari erupts from it, killing the host. The noise made by an emerging kalmari is that of 1,000 snakes hissing at once. A living target of a kalmari's possession must be willing, though that decision could be coerced (through force, blackmail, or magic).</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Ecology:</b> Once free of a host body, the kalmari must find another within 10 minutes or be banished back to Acheron. As a rule, these creatures seem to enjoy the power they wield in the Realms and are loath to leave. Their lawful nature also contributes to their stubbornness in this matter and also is part of the reason they are chosen as guardians of important mountain passes, potent magical items, fabulous treasures, and secret passages. How kalmari reproduce is unknown, though fission is most likely. Whether fission is possible in the Realms or only in the beast's home plane of Acheron is also unknown at this time.</p><p class=\"f\"><b>History:</b> Only one instance of a kalmari existing in the Realms for any length of time is recorded at this time. The creature apparently was summoned from Acheron by the wicked sorceress CASSANA to serve as a pet. The first open encounter between natives of the Realms and the kalmari occurred in the year 1357 DR during a period where Cassana had lent use of the creature to an illicit mercantile group known as the Iron Throne. The kalmari was placed in a human shell (a minor Iron Throne functionary unaware of the true costs involved) for the mission. The Iron Throne planned to use the beast to tighten its grip on Shadow Gap, an important mountain pass.</p><p>When the functionary publicly announced the closing of the pass and admitted to the murder of a contact of a local group of adventurers, a member of the group attacked the man. The warrior's blow (with his enchanted sword) split the body wide open, allowing the kalmari to escape. The creature promptly swallowed the warrior whole, sword and all. The kalmari rejected the sword, which was left untouched by the fleeing crowd.</p><p>The sword was recovered by a band of heroes that included Alias the tattooed swordswoman. Alias saw the above-described events in a dream. During their time in Shadow Gap and not long after Alias's dream, the kalmari entered their camp and attacked. Alias used Cassana's sigil, tattooed on her arm, to hold the sorceress's creature at bay until the halfling bard Olive Ruskettle retrieved the late warrior's sword. Olive and the saurial paladin Dragonbait then used the ingested-and-rejected weapon to destroy the beast.</p><p>Even though Cassana herself has perished, the secret of summoning such beasts will likely find its way to other unscrupulous wizards' hands.</p>\n","images":["<img src=\"grf/fr.gif\" width=\"150\" height=\"75\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Forgotten Realms\" title=\"Forgotten Realms\" align=\"right\">","<img src=\"img/kalmari.gif\" alt=\"Kalmari\" title=\"Kalmari\" border=\"0\" width=\"300\" height=\"360\" style=\"text-align:right;\" align=\"right\">","<img src=\"grf/tsr_sm.png\" width=\"56\" height=\"59\" border=\"0\" alt=\"TSR\">"],"setting":"Forgotten Realms","statblock":{"Kalmari":{"Activity Cycle":"Any","Alignment":"Lawful evil","Armor Class":"-6","Climate/Terrain":"Any","Damage/Attack":"1d10/1d6","Diet":"Carnivore","Frequency":"Very rare: Rare in Acheron","Hit Dice":"3+3","Intelligence":"Average","Magic Resistance":"100%","Morale":"Champion (16)","Movement":"6","No. Appearing":"1","No. of Attacks":"2","Organization":"Solitary","Size":"M","Special Attacks":"Swallow, entangle","Special Defenses":"+2 or better weapons to hit; Slain only by consumed & rejected magical item","THAC0":"17","Treasure":"Nil","XP Value":"2,000"}},"title":"Kalmari"},"sources":["9552"],"statblock_names":[],"title":"Kalmari","prev_key":"kalin","next_key":"kalothag","monster_path":"/appendix/kalmari"}},"staticQueryHashes":[],"slicesMap":{}}
