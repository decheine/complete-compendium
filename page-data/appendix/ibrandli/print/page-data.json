While the powers listed above are the most common, some aarakocra have different or additional powers.</p><p class=\"f\">A race of intelligent, birdlike creatures living in the deepest deserts of Athas, the rare Athasian <a href=\"/appendix/aarakocr\">aarakocra</a> spends its time soaring on thermals in search of food.</p><p>The aarakocra is 7 to 8 feet tall with a wingspan of 20 feet or more. Because of its large wingspan, an aarakocra can carry as much as 75% of its own body weight and still fly easily. An aarakocra can fly a short distance carrying a burden equaling 125% of its own body weight. The average body weight of a full grown male is 100 pounds and a female is 85 pounds.</p><p>Each wing has a &ldquo;hand&rdquo; at its midpoint, consisting of three fingers and an opposable thumb. The fourth finger forms the rigid leading edge of the wing. In flight the hands cannot be used, but on the ground the aarakocra can use its hands almost as a human would. The aarakocra's body is protected by a thin bony plate on the chest, much like a solid rib cage. Talons on its legs can be used as claws and can be retracted to reveal a second set of hands, also with three fingers and an opposable thumb. Except for the chest plate, the entire skeleton is hollow and extremely fragile.</p><p>From a distance, the Athasian aarakocra resembles a huge <a href=\"/appendix/bird\">vulture</a>. Its black eyes, set in the front of the head, provide excellent vision over a long range. The plumage is generally black with a white collar for adult males and black or brown with a smaller white collar for females. Adolescents are a mixture of brown and black. The beak is large and covers most of the head. Plumage begins at the crown of the head and is darker near the head, except for the collar. Athasian aarakocra speak their own language and the languages of vultures and other large birds. Some speak the common tongue (5% to 10% chance depending on how deep in the wastelands a tribe lives).</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Combat:</b> Aarakocra can fight in the air or on the ground. They prefer aerial combat since their bones are too fragile to withstand a solid blow from a human-sized opponent. In combat against creatures on the ground, they prefer to fly over their victim and drop weighted nets. Some aarakocra use darts to harass ground-based opponents.</p><p>If their opponents can fly, the aarakocra generally forgo the use of the net, although large groups sometimes use nets on flying creatures. Normally, aarakocra attack flying creatures with long spears, diving from above and allowing the momentum to carry the spear through the target. Such an attack doubles the damage if the aarakocra have been able to dive at least 50 feet. Only the very largest aarakocra can carry more than one of these spears, they can attack with both at once with no penalty, causing double damage on each strike. All diving attacks are made at +4 and should be treated as a charge attack. All other penalties and restrictions of charge attacks apply.</p><p>The effect of the aarakocra's nets depends on if the opponent is flying at the time it becomes entangled. Creatures on the ground that are hit by a net are entangled and unable to participate in any combat until they make a successful Strength check to get free of the net. Flying creatures hit by a net can no longer fly and immediately begin falling. If they cannot escape the net or use some magical means to arrest the fall, normal falling damage applies.</p><p>Unless victims are entangled in nets, aarakocra are cautious in ground combat. If the aarakocra outnumber their opponents they advance in a straight line and thrust with their spears. If outnumbered, or the opponents are particularly tough, the aarakocra withdraw. Victims entangled in nets are killed or incapacitated for use as food or ransom.</p><p>Athasian aarakocra are mindful of their physical limitations as well as their comparatively low psionic abilities. They do not normally initiate psionic combat. At the first sign of psionic powers from any of their victims, however, all aarakocra that have some ability will use whatever attack and defense modes they can in an attempt to destroy the threat. Large groups of is or more aarakocra may initiate psionic combat if their leaders feel they can win quickly and avoid physical combat.</p><p>In desperation, an aarakocra can attempt to bite an opponent in combat. Because of the unwieldiness of its beak, the aarakocra has a THAC0 of 18 if attacking with this appendage. Further, the birdman causes only 1d2 points of damage with the beak.</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Habitat/Society:</b> Athasian aarakocra live in tribes with 6-20 (2d8+4) members, depending on the prestige of the leader. The largest tribe ever recorded had 50 members. The tribal hunting territory depends on the size of the tribe, usually about 500 square miles for a tribe of 10 members. There are no rigid boundaries between tribes and border disputes are not uncommon.</p><p>Alignments of tribe members are similar to the alignment of the leader. A tribe that has a leader who is neutral good may have neutral good, chaotic good, lawful good, and true neutral members. A predominantly evil tribe does not recognize boundaries with other tribes and treats other tribes as inferior beings to be eliminated.</p><p>Athasian aarakocra aren't happy in enclosed spaces, but they they take refuge in a cave or building if necessary.</p><p>Nonevil tribes live in rocky aeries in the highest peaks they can find. Evil tribes are normally nomadic and use an aerie made by another tribe if they need to remain in an area for a long time, even if they have to evict the tribe that made the nest.</p><p>Aarakocra aren't friendly toward intruders in their territory, especially caravans. They try to extract a toll from the caravan for passage through the desert. Good-aligned tribes allow unhindered passage of caravans that pay a tribute. If someone refuses to pay the tribute, the aarakocra try to capture scouts or outriders from the party and hold them until an even larger tribute is paid. The payment may be either livestock or shiny objects. Aarakocra are smart enough not to be taken in by glass baubles instead of gems, although they cannot tell the difference between the more common gems and the rare ones.</p><p>Evil tribes ask for tribute and often attack a caravan whether it pays or not. Aarakocra always demand shiny objects such as stones. These tribes find humans and demihumans to be quite tasty and prefer them to other food.</p><p>Good-aligned tribes of aarakocra sometimes return a lost traveler to the edge of the desert after first removing any valuables the traveler may be carrying. On very rare occasions a tribe might return a lost group of travelers to the more frequently traveled parts of the desert, again after first taking any valuables as payment.</p><p>The oldest male is the leader of the tribal hunting party and has 4+4 Hit Dice. The oldest female is in charge of the tribal aerie and has 3+3 HD. In tribes that have more than 15 members, the next oldest aarakocra serves as shaman and has 3+3 HD; the shaman completes the triumvirate necessary for proper worship and the summoning of elementals. (Interestingly, no magic-using aarakocra has ever been recorded.) Tribes without a shaman cannot summon <a href=\"/appendix/element1\">air elementals</a>, which is an important part of aarakocra culture.</p><p>The shaman is the leader of the daily sun worship. Aarakocra worship the sun because it provides them with the thermals they need to soar in search of food. The shaman also leads the mystic rituals used to summon an air elemental. Summoning an air elemental is usually done only in preparation for the tribe's most sacred ceremony, the hunt. Small tribes must band together for this ceremony to allow the triumvirate to be formed.</p><p>The ceremony to summon an air elemental must be conducted at dawn and requires the oldest male and female to emit a highpitched keening whistle. The shaman conducts an intricate dance around them, simultaneously chanting an ancient summoning mantra.</p><p>The hunt is the final part of the initiation of adolescent aarakocra to adulthood and often takes the tribe far from their normal teritory. The target is always a <a href=\"/appendix/drakalsi\">silt drake</a>. The hunt is the only time the females leave the relative safety of the nest. Even an evil tribe will not interfere with a tribe on a hunt. An air elemental is often summoned to help find the drake, but never takes part in the actual combat. Although the adult members of the tribe take part in the initial phases of the combat, it is the initiates who deliver the final, killing blows to me drake. Scars from the hunt are considered a mark of pride among all aarakocra.</p><p>The females spend about eight months of the year incubating their eggs. Athasian aarakocra mate for life and a pair normally produces as many as 10 offspring. A female lays one egg a year. Constant incubation is not required because of the high daytime temperatures, so the females can maintain the nest and keep the tribe's treasure in order.</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Ecology:</b> Athasian aarakocra are high on the food chain and have no natural enemies other than <a href=\"/appendix/drakatha\">drakes</a>. Unless evil, aarakocra leave their own territory only to hunt the silt drake and return as soon as possible when the hunt is over. (Evil aarakocra attack others, as noted above.) Aarakocra eggs and hatchlings are sought after by wealthy land owners who wish to use the creatures as scouts and sentries. An egg can bring as much as 10 cp in Tyr's marketplace. Tribes that have had eggs or hatchlings stolen have long memories and sometimes take revenge against the thief at a later date. Captive aarakocra join any tribe they come in contact with.</p><p>Athasian aarakocra have a natural life span of 21-30 years.</p><br clear=\"all\" style=\"clear:both; height:0;\">\r\n","images":["<img src=\"grf/ds.gif\" width=\"150\" height=\"75\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Dark Sun\" title=\"Dark Sun\" align=\"right\">","<img src=\"img/aarakath.gif\" alt=\"Aarakocra (Athas)\" title=\"Aarakocra (Athas)\" border=\"0\" width=\"300\" height=\"360\" style=\"text-align:right;\" align=\"right\">","<img src=\"grf/add2_01.gif\" width=\"200\" height=\"56\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Advanced Dungeons & Dragons 2nd Edition\">"],"setting":"Dark Sun","statblock":{"Aarakocra (Athas)":{"Activity Cycle":"Day","Alignment":"Any","Armor Class":"7","Climate/Terrain":"Deep desert","Damage/Attack":"1d3/1d3 or by weapon","Diet":"Carnivore","Frequency":"Rare","Hit Dice":"2+2","Intelligence":"Average (8-10)","Magic Resistance":"Nil","Morale":"Steady (11)","Movement":"6, Fl 36 (C)","No. Appearing":"1d10","No. of Attacks":"2","Organization":"Tribal","Size":"M (20'+ wingspan)","Special Attacks":"Nil","Special Defenses":"Nil","THAC0":"17","Treasure":"Varies","XP Value":"65"}},"title":"Aarakocra (Athas)"},"sources":["2433"],"statblock_names":[],"title":"Aarakocra (Athas)","prev_key":"zygraat","next_key":"aarakocr","monster_path":"/appendix/aarakath"}}},"pageContext":{"monster_key":"ibrandli","monster_data":{"TSR":["1060","2166"],"fullBody":"  <table cellspacing=\"0\" cellpadding=\"0\"><tr><th>Climate/Terrain:</th><td>Any land or subterranean</td></tr><tr><th>Frequency:</th><td>Very rare</td></tr><tr><th>Organization:</th><td>Family/Pack (10% solitary)</td></tr><tr><th>Activity Cycle:</th><td>Any</td></tr><tr><th>Diet:</th><td>Carnivore</td></tr><tr><th>Intelligence:</th><td>Semi-(4)</td></tr><tr><th>Treasure:</th><td>Nil (except temple treasures, as guardian)</td></tr><tr><th>Alignment:</th><td>Lawful neutral</td></tr><tr><th>No. Appearing:</th><td>1-8</td></tr><tr><th>Armor Class:</th><td>3</td></tr><tr><th>Movement:</th><td>9</td></tr><tr><th>Hit Dice:</th><td>10</td></tr><tr><th>THAC0:</th><td>11</td></tr><tr><th>No. of Attacks:</th><td>5</td></tr><tr><th>Damage/Attack:</th><td>1-8 (&times;4 claws)/2-16 (bite)</td></tr><tr><th>Special Attacks:</th><td>Fire breath</td></tr><tr><th>Special Defenses:</th><td>Nil</td></tr><tr><th>Magic Resistance:</th><td>40%</td></tr><tr><th>Size:</th><td>G (40'+ long)</td></tr><tr><th>Morale:</th><td>Special</td></tr><tr><th>XP Value:</th><td>5,000</td></tr></table><p class=\"f\">Ibrandlin, or .lurkers in darkness,. as they are formally called, are creatures created from <a href=\"/appendix/lizard\">fire lizards</a> by human clerics of the god Ibrandul (see Ecology below). They appear as fire lizards with long, thick tails; in other words, they look like elongated, wingless <a href=\"/appendix/dragcred\">red dragons</a>. Ibrandlin have gray scaled bodies, with red-and brown-mottled backs and reddish undersides. Hatchlings are light gray all over, their scales darkening with age.</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Combat:</b> Ibrandlin attack with a lethal combination of raking claws and a vicious bite. Their serpentine bodies rear up on their tails to enable them to use all four claws, and they can simultaneously claw and breathe fire. Their fire breath is usable every fifth round, and appears as a cone 5' wide at the mouth, 10' wide at the end, and 15' long. The breath does 2-12 flame damage to all creatures it touches, half damage if a target's save against breath weapon succeeds. An ibrandlin uses its bite attack for that round while breathing fire. If a being not immune to fire is right in front of the lurker's maw when it breathes, that being suffers full flame damage.12 hit points, no save allowed, if a bite attack roll is successful. Lurkers are naturally immune to fire-based attacks.</p><p>Ibrandlin can climb, albeit slowly (MV 5), can pry open doors, and carry prey or objects. They lack the intelligence or precise control to wield magic items, but can duplicate an action they have just seen performed such as hurling a javelin of lightning or throwing a missile from a necklace of missiles. Consider any throwing motion an attack roll at a -3 penalty. If the attact misses, roll an additional 1d10 for deciding how far in feet the impact location is from its intended target.</p><p>Ibrandlin can pin creatures with a successful THAC0  roll. This replaces 3 claw attacks during the round, and means that a lurker has rolled its massive bulk atop a creature, though it uses its legs to displace most of its weight. Pinned creatures who lie quietly &ndash; verbal-only spellcasting possible &ndash; will be unharmed. Creatures who move or fight will find the ibrandlin's full weight on them and effectively take crushing damage of 1-4 points each round. The trapped creatures can move slightly but incur a penalty of -3 on attacks and damage. A single lurker can pin and entrap up to five M-sized creatures.</p><p>To escape a lurker's pin, a successful Strength Check and a successful Dexterity Check in the same round are both required, even if the lurker is dead; the Strength check allows the character to lift the ibrandlin's bulk away, and the Dexterity check grants the chance to roll free out from under the monster. A held or paralyzed lurker's flesh hardens: add a +10 penalty to the ability check rolls of a would-be escapee.</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Habitat/Society:</b> The god Ibrandul imparted secret breeding processes and transformation spells to his most faithful followers over the centuries, enabling them to create loyal temple guardians from captured fire lizards. Priests of Ibrandul are very excited: after hundreds of years, their artificially-created <q>lurkers in darkness</q> are beginning to breed true, producing other ibrandlin rather than hatchling fire lizards!</p><p>These creatures are trained from birth to revere and protect men and women wearing the vestments of Ibrandul &ndash; dark purple robes or tunics with four interlocked silver circles &ndash; and to guard a lair, usually a temple, against intruders.</p><p>Always found as guardians, lurkers are found wherever priests of Ibrandul place them. The lizards prefer subterranean lairs or dark interiors of buildings, and usually sleep 50% of the time. They can tolerate wide extremes of temperature, and they also react instantly to any situations when awakened. Hatchlings are always taken from the birthing area by priests for training.</p><p>Lurkers do not hoard treasure. They form family groups with all inhabitants of a temple, working as a team to guard the common items and splendors of their home lair. If it remains on the same plane, a lurker removed from the lair will always know the direction to its home lair and will slowly, doggedly travel back. Lurkers who lose their masters will aggressively defend their lair, even if it is in ruins. If new individuals arrive clad in the familiar vestments of Ibrandul, such lost lurkers will readily accept new masters. Lurkers are trained to understand both one word verbal commands and gestures: <q>Attack!</q>, <q>Defend!</q>, <q>Eat</q>, <q>Don't Eat</q>, and <q>Stand Guard</q> (i.e. don.t let this creature move) are by far the most common.</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Ecology:</b> Ibrandlin ordinarily eat cows, lame horses, and other livestock that priests procure, and seem immune to diseases, poisons, rot grubs, and other parasites. They can be fed meat that would otherwise be buried or burned. They have no real enemies, although wyverns and dragons have been known to attack them. Their eggs are worth 5,500 gp, hatchlings 8,000 gp.both purchases carry the enmity of all priests of Ibrandul, who will try to seize them by all possible means.</p><div style=\"border:thin solid #4169e1; margin:1em 1.5em 0; padding:.5em;\"><p>Ibrandul, whom the PCs have probably never heard of, is the <q>God of the Dry Depths</q>, (called <q>The Skulking God</q> by non-worshippers) a god of caverns and dungeons and the Underdark. Worshippers in Calimshan and other areas of The Shining South claim that Ibrandul watches over humans who must venture into hostile underground areas, aiding and guiding those who serve him, when when they are in need.</p><p>This small, chiefly Chaotic Neutral sect is expanding, its power steadily growing since the Time of Troubles. Thalandar, the high priest of Ibrandul, is famous in Tashluta for his impassioned <q>Who will lead you in the darkness?</q> sermons. He is trying to establish Ibrandul's worship as a powerful and respected faith in Waterdeep, located as it is over a vast and famous dungeon of underground rooms and powers. PCs will begin to hear his proselytizing message, second-or third-hand, in the taverns of the City: <i>Ibrandul guides you in the dark ways, drives away some dwellers in the darkness who would do you harm, and from time to time reveals great treasures to those who venture into the depths.</i></p><p>Unknown to all the worshippers, Ibrandul was killed by the hand of Shar. She always jealously guarded her portfolio of darkness and her worshippers, and when Ibrandul was weakened tremednously during the Time of Troubles, Shar killed him for daring to subvert followers of the dark away from her worship. After the gods ascended to the heavens, Shar acquired the power and portfolio of Ibrandul.</p><p>She keeps watch over the sect of Ibrandul and grants the clerics their spells. She is pleased with their work and uses her power to help the ibrandlin breed true. She is currently influencing Thalandar to spread the word of Ibrandul to Waterdeep, appearing to him in dreams. Shar's guise as Ibrandul is quite useful to her, allowing her to subvert the worship of her hated enemy Selune without drawing attention to her most faithful worshippers, the nightbringers. Waterdeep is one of the seats of Selune's power, and Shar/Ibrandul enjoys the delicious irony of secretly eroding the power of the Lady of Silver. Whether they call her Shar, Sharess, or Ibrandul, she values her worshippers of the night. The ibrandlin are her gift, guardians of the night's faithful.</p></div>\r\n<br clear=\"all\" style=\"clear:both; height:0;\">\r\n","images":["<img src=\"grf/fr.gif\" width=\"150\" height=\"75\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Forgotten Realms\" title=\"Forgotten Realms\" align=\"right\">","<img src=\"img/ibrandli.gif\" alt=\"Ibrandlin\" title=\"Ibrandlin\" border=\"0\" width=\"300\" height=\"360\" style=\"text-align:right;\" align=\"right\">","<img src=\"grf/add2_01.gif\" width=\"200\" height=\"56\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Advanced Dungeons & Dragons 2nd Edition\">"],"setting":"Forgotten Realms","statblock":{"Ibrandlin":{"Activity Cycle":"Any","Alignment":"Lawful neutral","Armor Class":"3","Climate/Terrain":"Any land or subterranean","Damage/Attack":"1-8 (&times;4 claws)/2-16 (bite)","Diet":"Carnivore","Frequency":"Very rare","Hit Dice":"10","Intelligence":"Semi-(4)","Magic Resistance":"40%","Morale":"Special","Movement":"9","No. Appearing":"1-8","No. of Attacks":"5","Organization":"Family/Pack (10% solitary)","Size":"G (40'+ long)","Special Attacks":"Fire breath","Special Defenses":"Nil","THAC0":"11","Treasure":"Nil (except temple treasures, as guardian)","XP Value":"5,000"}},"title":"Ibrandlin"},"sources":["1060","2166"],"statblock_names":[],"title":"Ibrandlin","prev_key":"hypnos","next_key":"icegnome","monster_path":"/appendix/ibrandli"}},"staticQueryHashes":[],"slicesMap":{}}
