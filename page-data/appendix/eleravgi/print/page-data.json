While the powers listed above are the most common, some aarakocra have different or additional powers.</p><p class=\"f\">A race of intelligent, birdlike creatures living in the deepest deserts of Athas, the rare Athasian <a href=\"/appendix/aarakocr\">aarakocra</a> spends its time soaring on thermals in search of food.</p><p>The aarakocra is 7 to 8 feet tall with a wingspan of 20 feet or more. Because of its large wingspan, an aarakocra can carry as much as 75% of its own body weight and still fly easily. An aarakocra can fly a short distance carrying a burden equaling 125% of its own body weight. The average body weight of a full grown male is 100 pounds and a female is 85 pounds.</p><p>Each wing has a &ldquo;hand&rdquo; at its midpoint, consisting of three fingers and an opposable thumb. The fourth finger forms the rigid leading edge of the wing. In flight the hands cannot be used, but on the ground the aarakocra can use its hands almost as a human would. The aarakocra's body is protected by a thin bony plate on the chest, much like a solid rib cage. Talons on its legs can be used as claws and can be retracted to reveal a second set of hands, also with three fingers and an opposable thumb. Except for the chest plate, the entire skeleton is hollow and extremely fragile.</p><p>From a distance, the Athasian aarakocra resembles a huge <a href=\"/appendix/bird\">vulture</a>. Its black eyes, set in the front of the head, provide excellent vision over a long range. The plumage is generally black with a white collar for adult males and black or brown with a smaller white collar for females. Adolescents are a mixture of brown and black. The beak is large and covers most of the head. Plumage begins at the crown of the head and is darker near the head, except for the collar. Athasian aarakocra speak their own language and the languages of vultures and other large birds. Some speak the common tongue (5% to 10% chance depending on how deep in the wastelands a tribe lives).</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Combat:</b> Aarakocra can fight in the air or on the ground. They prefer aerial combat since their bones are too fragile to withstand a solid blow from a human-sized opponent. In combat against creatures on the ground, they prefer to fly over their victim and drop weighted nets. Some aarakocra use darts to harass ground-based opponents.</p><p>If their opponents can fly, the aarakocra generally forgo the use of the net, although large groups sometimes use nets on flying creatures. Normally, aarakocra attack flying creatures with long spears, diving from above and allowing the momentum to carry the spear through the target. Such an attack doubles the damage if the aarakocra have been able to dive at least 50 feet. Only the very largest aarakocra can carry more than one of these spears, they can attack with both at once with no penalty, causing double damage on each strike. All diving attacks are made at +4 and should be treated as a charge attack. All other penalties and restrictions of charge attacks apply.</p><p>The effect of the aarakocra's nets depends on if the opponent is flying at the time it becomes entangled. Creatures on the ground that are hit by a net are entangled and unable to participate in any combat until they make a successful Strength check to get free of the net. Flying creatures hit by a net can no longer fly and immediately begin falling. If they cannot escape the net or use some magical means to arrest the fall, normal falling damage applies.</p><p>Unless victims are entangled in nets, aarakocra are cautious in ground combat. If the aarakocra outnumber their opponents they advance in a straight line and thrust with their spears. If outnumbered, or the opponents are particularly tough, the aarakocra withdraw. Victims entangled in nets are killed or incapacitated for use as food or ransom.</p><p>Athasian aarakocra are mindful of their physical limitations as well as their comparatively low psionic abilities. They do not normally initiate psionic combat. At the first sign of psionic powers from any of their victims, however, all aarakocra that have some ability will use whatever attack and defense modes they can in an attempt to destroy the threat. Large groups of is or more aarakocra may initiate psionic combat if their leaders feel they can win quickly and avoid physical combat.</p><p>In desperation, an aarakocra can attempt to bite an opponent in combat. Because of the unwieldiness of its beak, the aarakocra has a THAC0 of 18 if attacking with this appendage. Further, the birdman causes only 1d2 points of damage with the beak.</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Habitat/Society:</b> Athasian aarakocra live in tribes with 6-20 (2d8+4) members, depending on the prestige of the leader. The largest tribe ever recorded had 50 members. The tribal hunting territory depends on the size of the tribe, usually about 500 square miles for a tribe of 10 members. There are no rigid boundaries between tribes and border disputes are not uncommon.</p><p>Alignments of tribe members are similar to the alignment of the leader. A tribe that has a leader who is neutral good may have neutral good, chaotic good, lawful good, and true neutral members. A predominantly evil tribe does not recognize boundaries with other tribes and treats other tribes as inferior beings to be eliminated.</p><p>Athasian aarakocra aren't happy in enclosed spaces, but they they take refuge in a cave or building if necessary.</p><p>Nonevil tribes live in rocky aeries in the highest peaks they can find. Evil tribes are normally nomadic and use an aerie made by another tribe if they need to remain in an area for a long time, even if they have to evict the tribe that made the nest.</p><p>Aarakocra aren't friendly toward intruders in their territory, especially caravans. They try to extract a toll from the caravan for passage through the desert. Good-aligned tribes allow unhindered passage of caravans that pay a tribute. If someone refuses to pay the tribute, the aarakocra try to capture scouts or outriders from the party and hold them until an even larger tribute is paid. The payment may be either livestock or shiny objects. Aarakocra are smart enough not to be taken in by glass baubles instead of gems, although they cannot tell the difference between the more common gems and the rare ones.</p><p>Evil tribes ask for tribute and often attack a caravan whether it pays or not. Aarakocra always demand shiny objects such as stones. These tribes find humans and demihumans to be quite tasty and prefer them to other food.</p><p>Good-aligned tribes of aarakocra sometimes return a lost traveler to the edge of the desert after first removing any valuables the traveler may be carrying. On very rare occasions a tribe might return a lost group of travelers to the more frequently traveled parts of the desert, again after first taking any valuables as payment.</p><p>The oldest male is the leader of the tribal hunting party and has 4+4 Hit Dice. The oldest female is in charge of the tribal aerie and has 3+3 HD. In tribes that have more than 15 members, the next oldest aarakocra serves as shaman and has 3+3 HD; the shaman completes the triumvirate necessary for proper worship and the summoning of elementals. (Interestingly, no magic-using aarakocra has ever been recorded.) Tribes without a shaman cannot summon <a href=\"/appendix/element1\">air elementals</a>, which is an important part of aarakocra culture.</p><p>The shaman is the leader of the daily sun worship. Aarakocra worship the sun because it provides them with the thermals they need to soar in search of food. The shaman also leads the mystic rituals used to summon an air elemental. Summoning an air elemental is usually done only in preparation for the tribe's most sacred ceremony, the hunt. Small tribes must band together for this ceremony to allow the triumvirate to be formed.</p><p>The ceremony to summon an air elemental must be conducted at dawn and requires the oldest male and female to emit a highpitched keening whistle. The shaman conducts an intricate dance around them, simultaneously chanting an ancient summoning mantra.</p><p>The hunt is the final part of the initiation of adolescent aarakocra to adulthood and often takes the tribe far from their normal teritory. The target is always a <a href=\"/appendix/drakalsi\">silt drake</a>. The hunt is the only time the females leave the relative safety of the nest. Even an evil tribe will not interfere with a tribe on a hunt. An air elemental is often summoned to help find the drake, but never takes part in the actual combat. Although the adult members of the tribe take part in the initial phases of the combat, it is the initiates who deliver the final, killing blows to me drake. Scars from the hunt are considered a mark of pride among all aarakocra.</p><p>The females spend about eight months of the year incubating their eggs. Athasian aarakocra mate for life and a pair normally produces as many as 10 offspring. A female lays one egg a year. Constant incubation is not required because of the high daytime temperatures, so the females can maintain the nest and keep the tribe's treasure in order.</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Ecology:</b> Athasian aarakocra are high on the food chain and have no natural enemies other than <a href=\"/appendix/drakatha\">drakes</a>. Unless evil, aarakocra leave their own territory only to hunt the silt drake and return as soon as possible when the hunt is over. (Evil aarakocra attack others, as noted above.) Aarakocra eggs and hatchlings are sought after by wealthy land owners who wish to use the creatures as scouts and sentries. An egg can bring as much as 10 cp in Tyr's marketplace. Tribes that have had eggs or hatchlings stolen have long memories and sometimes take revenge against the thief at a later date. Captive aarakocra join any tribe they come in contact with.</p><p>Athasian aarakocra have a natural life span of 21-30 years.</p><br clear=\"all\" style=\"clear:both; height:0;\">\r\n","images":["<img src=\"grf/ds.gif\" width=\"150\" height=\"75\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Dark Sun\" title=\"Dark Sun\" align=\"right\">","<img src=\"img/aarakath.gif\" alt=\"Aarakocra (Athas)\" title=\"Aarakocra (Athas)\" border=\"0\" width=\"300\" height=\"360\" style=\"text-align:right;\" align=\"right\">","<img src=\"grf/add2_01.gif\" width=\"200\" height=\"56\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Advanced Dungeons & Dragons 2nd Edition\">"],"setting":"Dark Sun","statblock":{"Aarakocra (Athas)":{"Activity Cycle":"Day","Alignment":"Any","Armor Class":"7","Climate/Terrain":"Deep desert","Damage/Attack":"1d3/1d3 or by weapon","Diet":"Carnivore","Frequency":"Rare","Hit Dice":"2+2","Intelligence":"Average (8-10)","Magic Resistance":"Nil","Morale":"Steady (11)","Movement":"6, Fl 36 (C)","No. Appearing":"1d10","No. of Attacks":"2","Organization":"Tribal","Size":"M (20'+ wingspan)","Special Attacks":"Nil","Special Defenses":"Nil","THAC0":"17","Treasure":"Varies","XP Value":"65"}},"title":"Aarakocra (Athas)"},"sources":["2433"],"statblock_names":[],"title":"Aarakocra (Athas)","prev_key":"zygraat","next_key":"aarakocr","monster_path":"/appendix/aarakath"}}},"pageContext":{"monster_key":"eleravgi","monster_data":{"TSR":null,"fullBody":"  <p class=\"f\"><a href=\"/appendix/eleravlo\">Ravenloft elementals</a> are not dissimilar to their more mundane cousins. However, they are created because of an unusual interaction between the Mists of Ravenloft and the fabric of the elemental planes. Thus, they tend to absorb some of the dark aspects common throughout the land and take on an aura of the macabre not found in elementals elsewhere.</p><p>Unlike <a href=\"/appendix/elementa\">true elementals</a>, those lurked in conjunction with the mists have no native plane to return to when their tasks in Ravenloft are done. The essences that animate them, however, are found in the mists that surround the dark domains of Ravenloft. Like true elementals, they can exist outside of the mists only in a shell of material drawn from the environment into which they are summoned.</p><p>As a rule, elementals are not very intelligent. They are aware, however, that they have been snatched away from their normal lives and forced into physical shells to do the bidding of another creature. As such, they are foul-tempered and violent when encountered and will seek, if possible, to avenge themselves upon their summoner (see below).</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Combat:</b> All Ravenloft elementals share a number of common features, many of which apply to combat situations. First, they are harmed only by magical +2 or better weapons. Similarly, creatures with fewer than 4 Hit Dice and no magical abilities are unable to harm an elemental in any way. Thus, a band of goblins would be helpless to fend off the attacks of an elemental unless they had access to a +2 or better weapon.</p><p>Unlike normal elementals, Ravenloft elementals are not held off by spells like <i>protection from evil</i> that ward off extraplanar creatures, for they are on their own plane in Ravcnloft. In addition, the fact that many spells intended for use against elemental creatures function differently in Ravenloft than they do in other realms makes these creatures doubly difficult to overcome.</p><p>All elementals are immune to attacks that draw on their basic natural element to inflict damage. Thus, a pyre elemental (which is a variant fire elemental) is unharmed by spells like <i>fireball</i>, and a grave elemental would remain unharmed by a<i>transmute rock to mud</i> spell.</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Summoning an Elemental:</b> There are three ways by which an elemental can be called into existence (conjured) by a wizard. These are detailed in the basic Elementals entry and will not be repeated here. The following information, however, supersedes the data presented earlier and applies only to the conjuration of elementals in Ravenloft. Much of this information is collected from various points in the <i>Ravenloft Boxed Set</i>.</p><p>The Dark Powers of Ravenloft restrict the free travel of planar creatures into and out of their domain. Thus, any attempt to summon a traditional elemental (air, earth, fire, or water) has a 20% chance of creating a Ravenloft elemental instead. If the materials needed to form such a creature are not close at hand, the Dark Powers provide them. Ravenloft elementals summoned by accident cannot be controlled by their conjurer and will be freewilled, angry forces when they arrive. For additional information on this, see &ldquo;Controlling an Elemental&rdquo; below.</p><p>Although most appearances of Ravenloft elementals are the result of a failed attempt to conjure a traditional elemental, this is not always the case. A specific attempt to conjure a Ravenloft elemental is possible, provided the caster has the materials required to form the creature's shell (soil from a grave, a funeral pyre, etc.) In fact, it is only through the purposeful summoning of a Ravenloft elemental that such a creature can be controlled by its conjurer. Such deliberate uses of the Dark Powers of Ravenloft require a Ravenloft Powers check by the summoner, with the level of the check (1-5%) being determined based on the purpose for which the summoned creature is used.</p><p>In all other ways, the process of conjuring an elemental in Ravenloft is similar to that employed outside of the dark domain.</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Controlling an Elemental:</b> As stated in the basic elemental entry, absolute concentration is required to control a summoned elemental. In Ravenloft, however, it is even more difficult to control elementals than it is in other planes. Because of this, all conjured elementals receive a saving throw versus spells at -2 to escape control on the round that they arrive in Ravenloft. If this spell fails, they are not allowed another unless a new person tries to take control of them (see below). Ravenloft elementals that are conjured by accident are automatically uncontrolled (or <i>free-willed</i>).</p><p>A <i>free-willed</i> elemental will use its first action to attempt a return to its home 25% of the time. Otherwise, it will attack the character that conjured it. Since escaping from Ravenloft is not easy, those elementals who attempt to leave instantly will fail and will then turn on their creator as well.</p><p>Spells like <i>dismissal</i> or <i>banishment</i> do not work the same way in Ravenloft that they do in other domains. The exact effects of these and other spells are described in the <i>Ravenloft Boxed Set</i>, but it should suffice to say that they are seldom able to send a summoned elemental out of Ravenloft.</p><p>In all other ways, control of elementals is handled the same way that it is in other realms. The exception to this, obviously, is that a summoned elemental cannot return to its home plane (as most will do after no more than 3 rounds of combat). Trapped in Ravenloft, they will do everything in their power to destroy those who brought them into that place.</p><p>A Ravenloft elemental that is successfully controlled will, of course, break free of the caster's influence at the end of the duration of a conjuration spell. Since it is unable to return to its home at this time. it will become free-willed (see below).</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Stealing Control of an Elemental:</b> <b>Stealing Control of an Elemental:</b> This is handled just as it is with normal elementals, save for one thing. Any successful attempt to break another's control of an elemental allows it to make a new saving throw (albeit with a -2 penalty) to avoid the control of its new master.</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Free-willed Ravenloft Elementals:</b> <b>Free-willed Ravenloft Elementals:</b> A free-willed Ravenloft elemental will seek to destroy the one who created it, for only by so doing can it be freed from servitude. As soon as the conjurer is slain, the Ravenloft elemental dissipates, ending any threat it might pose to others. If the summoner flees the area, it will find itself stalked by the monster until one or the other is destroyed. Because of the bond created between the two beings at the time of the summoning, the elemental will always know the location of its intended victim and can follow him no matter where he goes or what wards he erects around himself.</p><br clear=\"all\" style=\"clear:both; height:0;\">\r\n","images":["<img src=\"grf/rv.gif\" width=\"150\" height=\"75\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Ravenloft\" title=\"Ravenloft\" align=\"right\">","<img src=\"grf/add2_01.gif\" width=\"200\" height=\"56\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Advanced Dungeons & Dragons 2nd Edition\">"],"setting":"Ravenloft","title":"Elemental (Ravenloft), General Information"},"sources":null,"statblock_names":[],"title":"Elemental (Ravenloft), General Information","prev_key":"elephant","next_key":"eleravlo","monster_path":"/appendix/eleravgi"}},"staticQueryHashes":[],"slicesMap":{}}
