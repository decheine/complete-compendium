While the powers listed above are the most common, some aarakocra have different or additional powers.</p><p class=\"f\">A race of intelligent, birdlike creatures living in the deepest deserts of Athas, the rare Athasian <a href=\"/appendix/aarakocr\">aarakocra</a> spends its time soaring on thermals in search of food.</p><p>The aarakocra is 7 to 8 feet tall with a wingspan of 20 feet or more. Because of its large wingspan, an aarakocra can carry as much as 75% of its own body weight and still fly easily. An aarakocra can fly a short distance carrying a burden equaling 125% of its own body weight. The average body weight of a full grown male is 100 pounds and a female is 85 pounds.</p><p>Each wing has a &ldquo;hand&rdquo; at its midpoint, consisting of three fingers and an opposable thumb. The fourth finger forms the rigid leading edge of the wing. In flight the hands cannot be used, but on the ground the aarakocra can use its hands almost as a human would. The aarakocra's body is protected by a thin bony plate on the chest, much like a solid rib cage. Talons on its legs can be used as claws and can be retracted to reveal a second set of hands, also with three fingers and an opposable thumb. Except for the chest plate, the entire skeleton is hollow and extremely fragile.</p><p>From a distance, the Athasian aarakocra resembles a huge <a href=\"/appendix/bird\">vulture</a>. Its black eyes, set in the front of the head, provide excellent vision over a long range. The plumage is generally black with a white collar for adult males and black or brown with a smaller white collar for females. Adolescents are a mixture of brown and black. The beak is large and covers most of the head. Plumage begins at the crown of the head and is darker near the head, except for the collar. Athasian aarakocra speak their own language and the languages of vultures and other large birds. Some speak the common tongue (5% to 10% chance depending on how deep in the wastelands a tribe lives).</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Combat:</b> Aarakocra can fight in the air or on the ground. They prefer aerial combat since their bones are too fragile to withstand a solid blow from a human-sized opponent. In combat against creatures on the ground, they prefer to fly over their victim and drop weighted nets. Some aarakocra use darts to harass ground-based opponents.</p><p>If their opponents can fly, the aarakocra generally forgo the use of the net, although large groups sometimes use nets on flying creatures. Normally, aarakocra attack flying creatures with long spears, diving from above and allowing the momentum to carry the spear through the target. Such an attack doubles the damage if the aarakocra have been able to dive at least 50 feet. Only the very largest aarakocra can carry more than one of these spears, they can attack with both at once with no penalty, causing double damage on each strike. All diving attacks are made at +4 and should be treated as a charge attack. All other penalties and restrictions of charge attacks apply.</p><p>The effect of the aarakocra's nets depends on if the opponent is flying at the time it becomes entangled. Creatures on the ground that are hit by a net are entangled and unable to participate in any combat until they make a successful Strength check to get free of the net. Flying creatures hit by a net can no longer fly and immediately begin falling. If they cannot escape the net or use some magical means to arrest the fall, normal falling damage applies.</p><p>Unless victims are entangled in nets, aarakocra are cautious in ground combat. If the aarakocra outnumber their opponents they advance in a straight line and thrust with their spears. If outnumbered, or the opponents are particularly tough, the aarakocra withdraw. Victims entangled in nets are killed or incapacitated for use as food or ransom.</p><p>Athasian aarakocra are mindful of their physical limitations as well as their comparatively low psionic abilities. They do not normally initiate psionic combat. At the first sign of psionic powers from any of their victims, however, all aarakocra that have some ability will use whatever attack and defense modes they can in an attempt to destroy the threat. Large groups of is or more aarakocra may initiate psionic combat if their leaders feel they can win quickly and avoid physical combat.</p><p>In desperation, an aarakocra can attempt to bite an opponent in combat. Because of the unwieldiness of its beak, the aarakocra has a THAC0 of 18 if attacking with this appendage. Further, the birdman causes only 1d2 points of damage with the beak.</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Habitat/Society:</b> Athasian aarakocra live in tribes with 6-20 (2d8+4) members, depending on the prestige of the leader. The largest tribe ever recorded had 50 members. The tribal hunting territory depends on the size of the tribe, usually about 500 square miles for a tribe of 10 members. There are no rigid boundaries between tribes and border disputes are not uncommon.</p><p>Alignments of tribe members are similar to the alignment of the leader. A tribe that has a leader who is neutral good may have neutral good, chaotic good, lawful good, and true neutral members. A predominantly evil tribe does not recognize boundaries with other tribes and treats other tribes as inferior beings to be eliminated.</p><p>Athasian aarakocra aren't happy in enclosed spaces, but they they take refuge in a cave or building if necessary.</p><p>Nonevil tribes live in rocky aeries in the highest peaks they can find. Evil tribes are normally nomadic and use an aerie made by another tribe if they need to remain in an area for a long time, even if they have to evict the tribe that made the nest.</p><p>Aarakocra aren't friendly toward intruders in their territory, especially caravans. They try to extract a toll from the caravan for passage through the desert. Good-aligned tribes allow unhindered passage of caravans that pay a tribute. If someone refuses to pay the tribute, the aarakocra try to capture scouts or outriders from the party and hold them until an even larger tribute is paid. The payment may be either livestock or shiny objects. Aarakocra are smart enough not to be taken in by glass baubles instead of gems, although they cannot tell the difference between the more common gems and the rare ones.</p><p>Evil tribes ask for tribute and often attack a caravan whether it pays or not. Aarakocra always demand shiny objects such as stones. These tribes find humans and demihumans to be quite tasty and prefer them to other food.</p><p>Good-aligned tribes of aarakocra sometimes return a lost traveler to the edge of the desert after first removing any valuables the traveler may be carrying. On very rare occasions a tribe might return a lost group of travelers to the more frequently traveled parts of the desert, again after first taking any valuables as payment.</p><p>The oldest male is the leader of the tribal hunting party and has 4+4 Hit Dice. The oldest female is in charge of the tribal aerie and has 3+3 HD. In tribes that have more than 15 members, the next oldest aarakocra serves as shaman and has 3+3 HD; the shaman completes the triumvirate necessary for proper worship and the summoning of elementals. (Interestingly, no magic-using aarakocra has ever been recorded.) Tribes without a shaman cannot summon <a href=\"/appendix/element1\">air elementals</a>, which is an important part of aarakocra culture.</p><p>The shaman is the leader of the daily sun worship. Aarakocra worship the sun because it provides them with the thermals they need to soar in search of food. The shaman also leads the mystic rituals used to summon an air elemental. Summoning an air elemental is usually done only in preparation for the tribe's most sacred ceremony, the hunt. Small tribes must band together for this ceremony to allow the triumvirate to be formed.</p><p>The ceremony to summon an air elemental must be conducted at dawn and requires the oldest male and female to emit a highpitched keening whistle. The shaman conducts an intricate dance around them, simultaneously chanting an ancient summoning mantra.</p><p>The hunt is the final part of the initiation of adolescent aarakocra to adulthood and often takes the tribe far from their normal teritory. The target is always a <a href=\"/appendix/drakalsi\">silt drake</a>. The hunt is the only time the females leave the relative safety of the nest. Even an evil tribe will not interfere with a tribe on a hunt. An air elemental is often summoned to help find the drake, but never takes part in the actual combat. Although the adult members of the tribe take part in the initial phases of the combat, it is the initiates who deliver the final, killing blows to me drake. Scars from the hunt are considered a mark of pride among all aarakocra.</p><p>The females spend about eight months of the year incubating their eggs. Athasian aarakocra mate for life and a pair normally produces as many as 10 offspring. A female lays one egg a year. Constant incubation is not required because of the high daytime temperatures, so the females can maintain the nest and keep the tribe's treasure in order.</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Ecology:</b> Athasian aarakocra are high on the food chain and have no natural enemies other than <a href=\"/appendix/drakatha\">drakes</a>. Unless evil, aarakocra leave their own territory only to hunt the silt drake and return as soon as possible when the hunt is over. (Evil aarakocra attack others, as noted above.) Aarakocra eggs and hatchlings are sought after by wealthy land owners who wish to use the creatures as scouts and sentries. An egg can bring as much as 10 cp in Tyr's marketplace. Tribes that have had eggs or hatchlings stolen have long memories and sometimes take revenge against the thief at a later date. Captive aarakocra join any tribe they come in contact with.</p><p>Athasian aarakocra have a natural life span of 21-30 years.</p><br clear=\"all\" style=\"clear:both; height:0;\">\r\n","images":["<img src=\"grf/ds.gif\" width=\"150\" height=\"75\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Dark Sun\" title=\"Dark Sun\" align=\"right\">","<img src=\"img/aarakath.gif\" alt=\"Aarakocra (Athas)\" title=\"Aarakocra (Athas)\" border=\"0\" width=\"300\" height=\"360\" style=\"text-align:right;\" align=\"right\">","<img src=\"grf/add2_01.gif\" width=\"200\" height=\"56\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Advanced Dungeons & Dragons 2nd Edition\">"],"setting":"Dark Sun","statblock":{"Aarakocra (Athas)":{"Activity Cycle":"Day","Alignment":"Any","Armor Class":"7","Climate/Terrain":"Deep desert","Damage/Attack":"1d3/1d3 or by weapon","Diet":"Carnivore","Frequency":"Rare","Hit Dice":"2+2","Intelligence":"Average (8-10)","Magic Resistance":"Nil","Morale":"Steady (11)","Movement":"6, Fl 36 (C)","No. Appearing":"1d10","No. of Attacks":"2","Organization":"Tribal","Size":"M (20'+ wingspan)","Special Attacks":"Nil","Special Defenses":"Nil","THAC0":"17","Treasure":"Varies","XP Value":"65"}},"title":"Aarakocra (Athas)"},"sources":["2433"],"statblock_names":[],"title":"Aarakocra (Athas)","prev_key":"zygraat","next_key":"aarakocr","monster_path":"/appendix/aarakath"}}},"pageContext":{"monster_key":"giwoitis","monster_data":{"TSR":["TheLonesomeRoad"],"fullBody":"  <table cellspacing=\"0\" cellpadding=\"0\"><tr><th>Climate/Terrain:</th><td>Temperate plains, forests, and homes (Barovia)</td></tr><tr><th>Frequency:</th><td>Very rare</td></tr><tr><th>Organization:</th><td>Solitary</td></tr><tr><th>Activity Cycle:</th><td>Night</td></tr><tr><th>Diet:</th><td>Carnivore</td></tr><tr><th>Intelligence:</th><td>Very (11-12)</td></tr><tr><th>Treasure:</th><td>Nil</td></tr><tr><th>Alignment:</th><td>Lawful good</td></tr><tr><th>No. Appearing:</th><td>1</td></tr><tr><th>Armor Class:</th><td>7</td></tr><tr><th>Movement:</th><td>12</td></tr><tr><th>Hit Dice:</th><td>1 hp</td></tr><tr><th>THAC0:</th><td>20</td></tr><tr><th>No. of Attacks:</th><td>1</td></tr><tr><th>Damage/Attack:</th><td>1</td></tr><tr><th>Special Attacks:</th><td>Nil</td></tr><tr><th>Special Defenses:</th><td>Undead Ward</td></tr><tr><th>Magic Resistance:</th><td>50%</td></tr><tr><th>Size:</th><td>T (6&rdquo; long)</td></tr><tr><th>Morale:</th><td>Unsteady (5-7)</td></tr><tr><th>XP Value:</th><td>35</td></tr></table><p class=\"f\"><i>Why do you assume that there is no good in our Land? True, the minions of evil lurk on your doorstep, but the servants of righteousness are present as well. You just have to look a little harder�</i></p><p><i>Andrei Tiszanov</i></p><p><br></p><p class=\"ni\">The giwoitis is strange little creature that guards Barovian homes from the undead. By currying the giwoitis' favor, a family can ensure that it protects them from <a href=\"/appendix/vampire\">vampires</a> and the like. Although the giwoitis appears to be a harmless <a href=\"/appendix/lizard\">lizard</a>, it commands potent powers that terrify all but the most powerful undead creatures.</p><p>A giwoitis (the term is both singular and plural) resembles one of the tiny meadow lizards common to Barovia. It is about six inches in length, fully two-thirds of which belongs to its long, tapering tail. The creature has a long, pointed head and plump legs with tiny, clawed digits. It is predominantly bright green in color, though yellow or white stripes run down the length of its body, edged by cinnamon-colored spots or flecks. \r\nThough they are intelligent, giwoitis cannot speak. They are, however, capable of communicating with other beings through telepathy. They rarely use this ability with anyone other than proven allies, however.</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Combat:</b> In terms of physical combat, giwoitis are about as defenseless as the lizards they appear to be. In most cases, a threatened giwoitis will simply flee, as they can scurry away as fast as a man can run. A giwoitis will not leave helpless creatures of non-evil alignment behind, however, and remains with the defenseless even it means risk to its own life. If cornered (or picked up without permission) a giwoitis can deliver a painful but insignificant bite that causes only 1 point of damage. This bite is only effective against bare flesh, and any kind of armor will protect against it. Their only other inherent defense is their surprisingly high magic resistance (50%).</p><p>Giwoitis do possess other remarkable abilities, however, and this is the reason that many Barovians go out of their way to lure the little lizard into their homes. Giwoitis can radiate a remarkable version of <i>undead ward</i> that affects an entire enclosed structure. The affected area must be a building with true walls and a roof, though it can be any size, from a shed to a castle's keep. As long as the giwoitis desires it, all undead who attempt to enter the structure - by passing through doorways, windows or other portals - are subject to turning as if by a 10th-level priest (see Table 91: Turning Undead in Domains of Dread, pg. 264). If several undead attempt to enter simultaneously, the <i>undead ward</i> affects each undead creature individually, with no limit to the number that can be turned. Even those undead that cannot normally be turned are affected by the giwoitis' ward, being treated as undead of equivalent hit dice. The undead ward also affects undead in unusual forms, such as a vampire's animal or gaseous forms. An undead creature teleporting inside a structure protected by the <i>undead ward</i> (or otherwise circumventing the normal entrances) is subject to turning immediately upon appearing inside. If it fails, it must flee the structure as quickly as possible through the nearest available exit. The giwoitis' ward never affects undead domain lords or undead minions under their direct control (such as <a href=\"/appendix/zombie\">zombies</a> and <a href=\"/appendix/skeleton\">skeletons</a>).</p><p>The giwoitis may turn its undead ward &ldquo;on&rdquo; and &ldquo;off&rdquo; at will. It may not use the ward in any structure that the DM deems to be a &ldquo;sinkhole of evil&rdquo; as described in Domains of Dread (pg 263). However, the giwoitis may instead use its ability to cancel a sinkhole of evil penalty of up to -2 for the purposes of other turning attempts. This ability does not provide a bonus to turning attempts; it merely cancels &ldquo;-2 worth&rdquo; of the sinkhole's penalty for as long as the giwoitis is in the sinkhole's area and maintains the effect.</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Habitat/Society:</b> Giwoitis are friendly and kind creatures, but pathologically shy. They can be lured into a home by placing a saucer of fresh, warm milk near the chimney each night. One should be persistent, even if it seems as if the coercion is not working. Eventually, a giwoitis will take up residence and observe its hosts for some time, judging their character. If it finds its hosts to be honest and virtuous folk, it will make the building its home, keeping its undead ward active at all times (even while hibernating during the winter months). It will normally remain hidden, even from its hosts, who only know of the giwoitis' presence by the absence of insect pests. If the creature is ever mistreated, it will give its hosts the opportunity to make amends, but will not forgive blatant abuse. Those hosts that strike the giwoitis as particularly kind-hearted and interesting (lawful good characters of high Charisma) may be approached. Giwoitis are shy, but enjoy telepathic conversation, particularly stories and moral parables. Though giwoitis are primarily attracted to the simple homes of the common folk, they also favor Barovia's few scattered wizards. Though it might be assumed that giwoitis reproduce just like the meadow lizards they resemble, more than one of the creatures has never been observed together.</p><p>Though giwoitis have long been a part of Barovian folklore as beneficent household spirits, the actual creatures are a relatively recent magical creation of the Gundarakite abjurer Andrei Tiszanov. Tiszanov was interested in creating an unobtrusive item that would protect the common folk's homes against undead creatures. He researched the problem for years as a young man, traveling extensively in the lands surrounding Gundarak. He eventually became intrigued by Barovian woodcarvings that depicted little green lizards, which the Barovians called giwoitis. They claimed that the giwoitis were kind, <a href=\"/appendix/brownie\">brownie</a>-like creatures that protected homes from harm. Tiszanov loved the idea, and created a pair of pseudo-homonculi to serve as living undead wards, imbuing them with powerful abjuration and necromancy magics. He then released the little creatures into the wild, shortly before the Great Upheaval.</p><p>Tiszanov thought fondly of his creations, but became dismayed as the years passed and he saw no sign that they had succeeded on their own. Now chafing under the yoke of Count Von Zarovich's militias, Andrei took to wandering again. He eventually discovered that the hatchlings of his giwoitis had indeed survived and spread, and found several households that hosted the benign lizards. The giwoitis' abilities were far more powerful than Tiszanov had suspected, however, and he speculated that something had occurred during the Great Upheaval to amplify their powers. For their part, the few Barovians and Gundarakites who are fortunate enough to host a giwoitis consider themselves blessed.</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Ecology:</b> Aside from their intelligence and their remarkable powers against the undead, giwoitis appear to be normal lizards in most respects. They eat insects and spiders, are preyed upon by hawks and owls, and hibernate in the winter. The creatures are most active at night, spending the days on rooftops and clinging to walls, soaking up the sun's warmth. Several wizards have learned to their great dismay that giwoitis provide no useful substances in the manufacture of anti-undead magical items.</p><p><br></p><p class=\"ni\"><a href=\"http://webspace.webring.com/people/du/um_8226/monsters//appendix/giwoitis\">The Lonesome Road</a></p><br clear=\"all\" style=\"clear:both; height:0;\">\r\n","images":["<img src=\"grf/rv.gif\" width=\"150\" height=\"75\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Ravenloft\" title=\"Ravenloft\" align=\"right\">","<img src=\"grf/add2_01.gif\" width=\"200\" height=\"56\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Advanced Dungeons & Dragons 2nd Edition\">"],"setting":"Ravenloft","statblock":{"Giwoitis":{"Activity Cycle":"Night","Alignment":"Lawful good","Armor Class":"7","Climate/Terrain":"Temperate plains, forests, and homes (Barovia)","Damage/Attack":"1","Diet":"Carnivore","Frequency":"Very rare","Hit Dice":"1 hp","Intelligence":"Very (11-12)","Magic Resistance":"50%","Morale":"Unsteady (5-7)","Movement":"12","No. Appearing":"1","No. of Attacks":"1","Organization":"Solitary","Size":"T (6&rdquo; long)","Special Attacks":"Nil","Special Defenses":"Undead Ward","THAC0":"20","Treasure":"Nil","XP Value":"35"}},"title":"Giwoitis"},"sources":["TheLonesomeRoad"],"statblock_names":[],"title":"Giwoitis","prev_key":"githzera","next_key":"gkloklok","monster_path":"/appendix/giwoitis"}},"staticQueryHashes":[],"slicesMap":{}}
