While the powers listed above are the most common, some aarakocra have different or additional powers.</p><p class=\"f\">A race of intelligent, birdlike creatures living in the deepest deserts of Athas, the rare Athasian <a href=\"/appendix/aarakocr\">aarakocra</a> spends its time soaring on thermals in search of food.</p><p>The aarakocra is 7 to 8 feet tall with a wingspan of 20 feet or more. Because of its large wingspan, an aarakocra can carry as much as 75% of its own body weight and still fly easily. An aarakocra can fly a short distance carrying a burden equaling 125% of its own body weight. The average body weight of a full grown male is 100 pounds and a female is 85 pounds.</p><p>Each wing has a &ldquo;hand&rdquo; at its midpoint, consisting of three fingers and an opposable thumb. The fourth finger forms the rigid leading edge of the wing. In flight the hands cannot be used, but on the ground the aarakocra can use its hands almost as a human would. The aarakocra's body is protected by a thin bony plate on the chest, much like a solid rib cage. Talons on its legs can be used as claws and can be retracted to reveal a second set of hands, also with three fingers and an opposable thumb. Except for the chest plate, the entire skeleton is hollow and extremely fragile.</p><p>From a distance, the Athasian aarakocra resembles a huge <a href=\"/appendix/bird\">vulture</a>. Its black eyes, set in the front of the head, provide excellent vision over a long range. The plumage is generally black with a white collar for adult males and black or brown with a smaller white collar for females. Adolescents are a mixture of brown and black. The beak is large and covers most of the head. Plumage begins at the crown of the head and is darker near the head, except for the collar. Athasian aarakocra speak their own language and the languages of vultures and other large birds. Some speak the common tongue (5% to 10% chance depending on how deep in the wastelands a tribe lives).</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Combat:</b> Aarakocra can fight in the air or on the ground. They prefer aerial combat since their bones are too fragile to withstand a solid blow from a human-sized opponent. In combat against creatures on the ground, they prefer to fly over their victim and drop weighted nets. Some aarakocra use darts to harass ground-based opponents.</p><p>If their opponents can fly, the aarakocra generally forgo the use of the net, although large groups sometimes use nets on flying creatures. Normally, aarakocra attack flying creatures with long spears, diving from above and allowing the momentum to carry the spear through the target. Such an attack doubles the damage if the aarakocra have been able to dive at least 50 feet. Only the very largest aarakocra can carry more than one of these spears, they can attack with both at once with no penalty, causing double damage on each strike. All diving attacks are made at +4 and should be treated as a charge attack. All other penalties and restrictions of charge attacks apply.</p><p>The effect of the aarakocra's nets depends on if the opponent is flying at the time it becomes entangled. Creatures on the ground that are hit by a net are entangled and unable to participate in any combat until they make a successful Strength check to get free of the net. Flying creatures hit by a net can no longer fly and immediately begin falling. If they cannot escape the net or use some magical means to arrest the fall, normal falling damage applies.</p><p>Unless victims are entangled in nets, aarakocra are cautious in ground combat. If the aarakocra outnumber their opponents they advance in a straight line and thrust with their spears. If outnumbered, or the opponents are particularly tough, the aarakocra withdraw. Victims entangled in nets are killed or incapacitated for use as food or ransom.</p><p>Athasian aarakocra are mindful of their physical limitations as well as their comparatively low psionic abilities. They do not normally initiate psionic combat. At the first sign of psionic powers from any of their victims, however, all aarakocra that have some ability will use whatever attack and defense modes they can in an attempt to destroy the threat. Large groups of is or more aarakocra may initiate psionic combat if their leaders feel they can win quickly and avoid physical combat.</p><p>In desperation, an aarakocra can attempt to bite an opponent in combat. Because of the unwieldiness of its beak, the aarakocra has a THAC0 of 18 if attacking with this appendage. Further, the birdman causes only 1d2 points of damage with the beak.</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Habitat/Society:</b> Athasian aarakocra live in tribes with 6-20 (2d8+4) members, depending on the prestige of the leader. The largest tribe ever recorded had 50 members. The tribal hunting territory depends on the size of the tribe, usually about 500 square miles for a tribe of 10 members. There are no rigid boundaries between tribes and border disputes are not uncommon.</p><p>Alignments of tribe members are similar to the alignment of the leader. A tribe that has a leader who is neutral good may have neutral good, chaotic good, lawful good, and true neutral members. A predominantly evil tribe does not recognize boundaries with other tribes and treats other tribes as inferior beings to be eliminated.</p><p>Athasian aarakocra aren't happy in enclosed spaces, but they they take refuge in a cave or building if necessary.</p><p>Nonevil tribes live in rocky aeries in the highest peaks they can find. Evil tribes are normally nomadic and use an aerie made by another tribe if they need to remain in an area for a long time, even if they have to evict the tribe that made the nest.</p><p>Aarakocra aren't friendly toward intruders in their territory, especially caravans. They try to extract a toll from the caravan for passage through the desert. Good-aligned tribes allow unhindered passage of caravans that pay a tribute. If someone refuses to pay the tribute, the aarakocra try to capture scouts or outriders from the party and hold them until an even larger tribute is paid. The payment may be either livestock or shiny objects. Aarakocra are smart enough not to be taken in by glass baubles instead of gems, although they cannot tell the difference between the more common gems and the rare ones.</p><p>Evil tribes ask for tribute and often attack a caravan whether it pays or not. Aarakocra always demand shiny objects such as stones. These tribes find humans and demihumans to be quite tasty and prefer them to other food.</p><p>Good-aligned tribes of aarakocra sometimes return a lost traveler to the edge of the desert after first removing any valuables the traveler may be carrying. On very rare occasions a tribe might return a lost group of travelers to the more frequently traveled parts of the desert, again after first taking any valuables as payment.</p><p>The oldest male is the leader of the tribal hunting party and has 4+4 Hit Dice. The oldest female is in charge of the tribal aerie and has 3+3 HD. In tribes that have more than 15 members, the next oldest aarakocra serves as shaman and has 3+3 HD; the shaman completes the triumvirate necessary for proper worship and the summoning of elementals. (Interestingly, no magic-using aarakocra has ever been recorded.) Tribes without a shaman cannot summon <a href=\"/appendix/element1\">air elementals</a>, which is an important part of aarakocra culture.</p><p>The shaman is the leader of the daily sun worship. Aarakocra worship the sun because it provides them with the thermals they need to soar in search of food. The shaman also leads the mystic rituals used to summon an air elemental. Summoning an air elemental is usually done only in preparation for the tribe's most sacred ceremony, the hunt. Small tribes must band together for this ceremony to allow the triumvirate to be formed.</p><p>The ceremony to summon an air elemental must be conducted at dawn and requires the oldest male and female to emit a highpitched keening whistle. The shaman conducts an intricate dance around them, simultaneously chanting an ancient summoning mantra.</p><p>The hunt is the final part of the initiation of adolescent aarakocra to adulthood and often takes the tribe far from their normal teritory. The target is always a <a href=\"/appendix/drakalsi\">silt drake</a>. The hunt is the only time the females leave the relative safety of the nest. Even an evil tribe will not interfere with a tribe on a hunt. An air elemental is often summoned to help find the drake, but never takes part in the actual combat. Although the adult members of the tribe take part in the initial phases of the combat, it is the initiates who deliver the final, killing blows to me drake. Scars from the hunt are considered a mark of pride among all aarakocra.</p><p>The females spend about eight months of the year incubating their eggs. Athasian aarakocra mate for life and a pair normally produces as many as 10 offspring. A female lays one egg a year. Constant incubation is not required because of the high daytime temperatures, so the females can maintain the nest and keep the tribe's treasure in order.</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Ecology:</b> Athasian aarakocra are high on the food chain and have no natural enemies other than <a href=\"/appendix/drakatha\">drakes</a>. Unless evil, aarakocra leave their own territory only to hunt the silt drake and return as soon as possible when the hunt is over. (Evil aarakocra attack others, as noted above.) Aarakocra eggs and hatchlings are sought after by wealthy land owners who wish to use the creatures as scouts and sentries. An egg can bring as much as 10 cp in Tyr's marketplace. Tribes that have had eggs or hatchlings stolen have long memories and sometimes take revenge against the thief at a later date. Captive aarakocra join any tribe they come in contact with.</p><p>Athasian aarakocra have a natural life span of 21-30 years.</p>\n","images":["<img src=\"grf/ds.gif\" width=\"150\" height=\"75\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Dark Sun\" title=\"Dark Sun\" align=\"right\">","<img src=\"img/aarakath.gif\" alt=\"Aarakocra (Athas)\" title=\"Aarakocra (Athas)\" border=\"0\" width=\"300\" height=\"360\" style=\"text-align:right;\" align=\"right\">","<img src=\"grf/add2_01.gif\" width=\"200\" height=\"56\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Advanced Dungeons & Dragons 2nd Edition\">"],"setting":"Dark Sun","statblock":{"Aarakocra (Athas)":{"Activity Cycle":"Day","Alignment":"Any","Armor Class":"7","Climate/Terrain":"Deep desert","Damage/Attack":"1d3/1d3 or by weapon","Diet":"Carnivore","Frequency":"Rare","Hit Dice":"2+2","Intelligence":"Average (8-10)","Magic Resistance":"Nil","Morale":"Steady (11)","Movement":"6, Fl 36 (C)","No. Appearing":"1d10","No. of Attacks":"2","Organization":"Tribal","Size":"M (20'+ wingspan)","Special Attacks":"Nil","Special Defenses":"Nil","THAC0":"17","Treasure":"Varies","XP Value":"65"}},"title":"Aarakocra (Athas)"},"sources":["2433"],"statblock_names":[],"title":"Aarakocra (Athas)","prev_key":"zygraat","next_key":"aarakocr","monster_path":"/appendix/aarakath"}}},"pageContext":{"monster_key":"nigmarbe","monster_data":{"TSR":["2405"],"fullBody":"  <table cellspacing=\"0\" cellpadding=\"0\"><tr><th>Climate/Terrain:</th><td>Any</td></tr><tr><th>Frequency:</th><td>Very rare</td></tr><tr><th>Organization:</th><td>Solitary</td></tr><tr><th>Activity Cycle:</th><td>Any</td></tr><tr><th>Diet:</th><td>Omnivore</td></tr><tr><th>Intelligence:</th><td>Average (8-10)</td></tr><tr><th>Treasure:</th><td>Nil (F)</td></tr><tr><th>Alignment:</th><td>Chaotic evil</td></tr><tr><th>No. Appearing:</th><td>1</td></tr><tr><th>Armor Class:</th><td>-5</td></tr><tr><th>Movement:</th><td>12</td></tr><tr><th>Hit Dice:</th><td>15</td></tr><tr><th>THAC0:</th><td>5</td></tr><tr><th>No. of Attacks:</th><td>5</td></tr><tr><th>Damage/Attack:</th><td>2-12/2-12/2-20/2-20/4-40</td></tr><tr><th>Special Attacks:</th><td>Psionics and Spells</td></tr><tr><th>Special Defenses:</th><td>+1 or better to hit (see below)</td></tr><tr><th>Magic Resistance:</th><td>20%</td></tr><tr><th>Size:</th><td>Gargantuan (30' tall)</td></tr><tr><th>Morale:</th><td>Champion (15-16)</td></tr><tr><th>XP Value:</th><td>16,000</td></tr></table><p class=\"f\"><b>Psionics Summary</b></p><table class=\"ip\"><tr class=\"bk\"><th>Level</th><th>Dis/Sci/Dev</th><th>Attack/Defense</th><th>Score</th><th>PSPs</th></tr><tr class=\"cn\"><td>10</td><td>4/4/11</td><td>PB,MT,EW,II,PsC/M-,TS,MB,IF,TW</td><td>17</td><td>180</td></tr></table><p class=\"ni\"><b>Psychokinesis -</b> <i>Science:</i> disintegrate; <i>Devotions:</i> ballistic attack, molecular agitation, molecular manipulation.</p><p class=\"ni\"><b>Psychometabolism -</b> <i>Sciences:</i> nil; <i>Devotions:</i> biofeedback, double pain.</p><p class=\"ni\"><b>Psychoportation -</b> <i>Sciences:</i> summon planar creature, teleport; <i>Devotion:</i> teleport trigger.</p><p class=\"ni\"><b>Telepathy -</b> <i>Sciences:</i> psionic blast, tower of iron will; <i>Devotions:</i> ego whip, id insinuation, intellect fortress, mental barrier, mind blank, mind thrust, psionic crush, thought shield, contact.</p><p class=\"f\">Of all the creatures that roam the planet Athas, none except the <a href=\"/appendix/dragotyr\">Dragon</a> is as feared, or as dangerous, as the nightmare beast.</p><p>Nightmare beasts have one immediately identifying characteristic, that being their immense size. All are nearly 20 feet tall and weigh close to 4,000 pounds each. Nightmare beasts are four-legged creatures; all these legs end in sharp claws, enabling them to climb quite well, despite their size. All nightmare beasts have similar skin coloration and texture. The skin of this creature is extremely thick and tough, very similar to that of an alligator or <a href=\"/appendix/crocodil\">crocodile</a>, but even more durable. Though usually a dark blue/grey in color, sometimes a beast's skin will be more purple. Nightmare beasts have large red eyes, which actually glow in the dark. A nightmare beast's teeth are very long, reaching eight inches in length, and are sharp, pointed canines capable of chopping a victim in two with ease. Two pairs of a nightmare beast's teeth are nearly twice as long as the rest; one is set in the lower jaw, one in the upper. These two pairs extend outside the creature's mouth and are exposed even when its mouth is closed. The lower pair is closer together and fits inside the upper pair. Nightmare beasts have large tusk-like horns on their heads, used by the creatures to rend their victims.</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Combat:</b> Nightmare beasts are very dangerous combatants, capable of defeating small armies of humans by themselves.</p><p>Though huge in size, nightmare beasts are capable of fairly quick movement, allowing them to close with opponents very rapidly. Their speed on land, combined with their great weight provides them with the ability to smash through nearly any obstacle, including city walls, trees, and small natural rock formations. When a nightmare beast attempts to smash through a wall, or fortification, the DM should roll 1d20 on &ldquo;Table 52: Structural Saving Throws&rdquo; (see the <i>DMG</i>; use the screw or drill line). If the roll is lower than the number on the table, the wall loses - of its structural integrity. Each subsequent successful attack reduces the integrity of the wall further, until it crumbles into rubble at the beast's feet.</p><p>When engaged in melee combat, a nightmare beast is absolutely devastating. When they attack, nightmare beasts raise up onto their hind legs, enabling them to attack with their front limbs. A nightmare beast on its hind legs is approximately 35 to 40 feet tall. Nightmare beasts are capable of up five attacks per round. They attack first with their two front clawed limbs, doing 2d6 points of damage per successful attack. The beast then attacks with both its horns, each capable of inflicting 2d10 points of damage. Finally, its massive bite can cause 4d10 points of damage.</p><p>The extremely thick skin of a nightmare beast provides it with incredible protection against attack (AC -5). In addition, only +1 or better weapons have any affect on the creature. Nightmare beasts also have a small degree (20%) of magic resistance, and spells or spell-like abilities used by creatures of 4 hit dice of less do only half damage. Thus, a spell cast by a 4th-level mage that gets past the creature's magic resistance will still only do half damage. Spells which save for half damage would do - damage when cast by characters with four or less Hit Dice.</p><p>It is believed that nightmare beasts were created through use of defiler magic, and it is known that all of its spell abilities are similar in effect to defiler magic. A unique adaptation of defiler magic's life draining effects has produced the nightmare beast's ability to drain life energy from its victims. Instead of using its normal attacks in a given round, a nightmare beast can drain life energy from a victim, resulting in the victim losing 1 experience level. When a nightmare beast uses this attack, it gains the same number of hit points lost by the victim. A nightmare beast can use this its energy drain ability only three times a day.</p><p>Nightmare beasts are also capable of magical and psionic attacks. Each round, a nightmare beast may attack normally, and use either one of its spells or one of its psionic powers. The creature is able to use the following spells, twice a day, once per round: <i>fireball</i>, <i>lightning bolt</i>, <i>chain lightning</i>, <i>dispel magic</i>, <i>wall of fire</i>, <i>incendiary cloud</i>, <i>death fog</i>, and <i>cloudkill</i>. A nightmare beast is immune to the effects of it own spells and all its spells are cast at 10th level of experience. All spells used by nightmare beasts are considered use of defiler magic.</p><p>The nightmare beast is also an extremely powerful psionic using creature, capable of feats usually performed only by the eldest and most experienced psionicists of Athas. As stated above, a nightmare beast can use one of its psionic powers each round that it doesn't employ one of its spells. Also, the nightmare beast has strong psionic defense modes, all of which are considered to be always &ldquo;on&rdquo;. Thus, any psionic attack launched at a nightmare beast is automatically defended against with the most effective defense mode. However, defense still depends upon whether or not the beast has sufficient PSPs to power the defense mode it attempts to use.</p><p>A nightmare beast will often employ the most direct and brutal attack forms it has at its disposal. Among its psionic powers, it will often favor use of its psychokinetic discipline, as it allows the creature to destroy weapons as well as buildings which may be in its way. It will frequently use its psychoportation discipline too. The teleport devotion allows the creature to instantly appear before its enemies and to vanish if it feels threatened. It will employ its summon planar creature science to summon creatures to further its destructive rampage. When it has sufficient PSPs, it will summon creatures from the outer planes first, then from the other planes as needed.</p><p>One other unique psionic ability of the nightmare beast is its &ldquo;nightmare&rdquo; attack. With this ability, a nightmare beast can enter the dreams of its victims and prey on their subconscious minds. This ability is used in two distinctly different manners. The first is used against future victims, those which the beast is either stalking or is intent on attacking. The beast uses this ability when these victims are sleeping. Any intended victims must save vs. spells (at -2) or suffer from nightmares of extreme horror (in which the victim is stalked, hunted, and killed by the nightmare beast). These dreams are so vivid that they prevent the victim from properly resting. The victim does not naturally heal any hit points previously lost and suffers from fatigue. Victims of fatigue suffer a -1 to all rolls, and they have their movement rates lowered as though they were &ldquo;moderately encumbered&rdquo;. These penalties are in effect for three days, or until a <i>heal</i> spell is cast upon the victim.</p><p>The other manner in which a nightmare beast uses its &ldquo;nightmare&rdquo; attack is during combat. When used in combat, this ability is treated as a normal psionic ability; it can be used in the same round as the beast's melee attacks. When this ability is used, all creatures within a 50' radius of the nightmare beast must save vs. spells at -2. Those who make their saves are unaffected. Those who fail are affected the next time they go to sleep. While they sleep, victims of this attack have dreams as described above, in which they are stalked, hunted, and killed by the nightmare beast. The effects of these dreams are the same as those described above. They will also last for the same duration (three days) or until a <i>heal</i> spell is cast. Use of the &ldquo;nightmare attack&rdquo; ability in either manner costs the nightmare beast 50 PSPs and requires a psionic check to be employed.</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Habitat/Society:</b> Nightmare beasts can be encountered in virtually any terrain on Athas. Fortunately, there are very few of these creatures. Some historians think that once there were as many as a hundred of these beasts roaming the world. Now there are believed to be only half a dozen remaining.</p><p>Nightmare beasts live in their lairs for long periods of time (up to one year). After that time, they will roam the desert until they find a suitable area in which to make their new lair. When a nightmare beast settles into a new lair, it will most often settle near ancient ruins of the former civilization that once inhabited Athas. No matter where they make their lairs, nightmare beasts do so in a consistent manner. All beast lairs are very defensible and well-protected. The nightmare beast will always choose a lair that is difficult to attack from both land and air.</p><p>Nightmare beasts only rest in their lairs for short periods, usually no more that 6 hours at a time. The rest of their time is spent roaming the area near their lairs and feeding. These beasts will normally rotate between resting and roaming in 6-hour time periods. This activity cycle is maintained for days and sometimes weeks at a time. (The only time that a beast will change this cycle is when it is preparing for battle.) When resting in its lair, a nightmare beast will often use a unique variant of the psionic danger sense devotion. This ability functions as described in the <i>Complete Psionics Handbook</i> except that its range extends to cover the entire lair and the PSP cost is only 5 per hour (instead of the normal 3 per turn).</p><p>When a nightmare beast roams the area surrounding its lair, its main purpose is to feed itself. These creatures eat nearly anything, both animal and vegetable. Entire herds of <a href=\"/appendix/animdoa1\">erdlus</a> and <a href=\"/appendix/animdoa1\">kanks</a> have been killed when a nightmare beast has come across them while feeding.</p><p>There are certain creatures that a nightmare beast will not attack, even when it is searching for food. Nightmare beasts will not attack <a href=\"/appendix/drakatha\">drakes</a> or <a href=\"/appendix/megapede\">megapedes</a>, for example, nor would one ever try to fight the Dragon.</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Ecology:</b> As stated above, nightmare beasts eat almost every type of food available on Athas. However, they are unsuitable as a food source because their bodies decay rapidly after death. It is thought that this is because the magic which has sustained their lives vanishes when they die, causing an unnatural rate of decay. However, the horns, claws, and teeth of a nightmare beast make excellent weapons and are usually used in arrowheads, daggers, and (sometimes) darts. Also, the horns of a nightmare beast can be ground and mixed with water to create a paste. When consumed, the paste produces an effect similar to <a href=\"/appendix/espeweed\">esperweed</a>, though much less powerful. The paste grants the consumer 30 additional PSPs and two wild talents. Its effect lasts for 5 rounds.</p>\n","images":["<img src=\"grf/ds.gif\" width=\"150\" height=\"75\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Dark Sun\" title=\"Dark Sun\" align=\"right\">","<img src=\"img/nigmarbe.gif\" alt=\"Nightmare Beast\" title=\"Nightmare Beast\" border=\"0\" width=\"300\" height=\"360\" style=\"text-align:right;\" align=\"right\">","<img src=\"grf/add2_01.gif\" width=\"200\" height=\"56\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Advanced Dungeons & Dragons 2nd Edition\">"],"setting":"Dark Sun","statblock":{"Nightmare Beast":{"Activity Cycle":"Any","Alignment":"Chaotic evil","Armor Class":"-5","Climate/Terrain":"Any","Damage/Attack":"2-12/2-12/2-20/2-20/4-40","Diet":"Omnivore","Frequency":"Very rare","Hit Dice":"15","Intelligence":"Average (8-10)","Magic Resistance":"20%","Morale":"Champion (15-16)","Movement":"12","No. Appearing":"1","No. of Attacks":"5","Organization":"Solitary","Size":"Gargantuan (30' tall)","Special Attacks":"Psionics and Spells","Special Defenses":"+1 or better to hit (see below)","THAC0":"5","Treasure":"Nil (F)","XP Value":"16,000"}},"title":"Nightmare Beast"},"sources":["2405"],"statblock_names":[],"title":"Nightmare Beast","prev_key":"nightmar","next_key":"nigmarco","monster_path":"/appendix/nigmarbe"}},"staticQueryHashes":[],"slicesMap":{}}
