While the powers listed above are the most common, some aarakocra have different or additional powers.</p><p class=\"f\">A race of intelligent, birdlike creatures living in the deepest deserts of Athas, the rare Athasian <a href=\"/appendix/aarakocr\">aarakocra</a> spends its time soaring on thermals in search of food.</p><p>The aarakocra is 7 to 8 feet tall with a wingspan of 20 feet or more. Because of its large wingspan, an aarakocra can carry as much as 75% of its own body weight and still fly easily. An aarakocra can fly a short distance carrying a burden equaling 125% of its own body weight. The average body weight of a full grown male is 100 pounds and a female is 85 pounds.</p><p>Each wing has a &ldquo;hand&rdquo; at its midpoint, consisting of three fingers and an opposable thumb. The fourth finger forms the rigid leading edge of the wing. In flight the hands cannot be used, but on the ground the aarakocra can use its hands almost as a human would. The aarakocra's body is protected by a thin bony plate on the chest, much like a solid rib cage. Talons on its legs can be used as claws and can be retracted to reveal a second set of hands, also with three fingers and an opposable thumb. Except for the chest plate, the entire skeleton is hollow and extremely fragile.</p><p>From a distance, the Athasian aarakocra resembles a huge <a href=\"/appendix/bird\">vulture</a>. Its black eyes, set in the front of the head, provide excellent vision over a long range. The plumage is generally black with a white collar for adult males and black or brown with a smaller white collar for females. Adolescents are a mixture of brown and black. The beak is large and covers most of the head. Plumage begins at the crown of the head and is darker near the head, except for the collar. Athasian aarakocra speak their own language and the languages of vultures and other large birds. Some speak the common tongue (5% to 10% chance depending on how deep in the wastelands a tribe lives).</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Combat:</b> Aarakocra can fight in the air or on the ground. They prefer aerial combat since their bones are too fragile to withstand a solid blow from a human-sized opponent. In combat against creatures on the ground, they prefer to fly over their victim and drop weighted nets. Some aarakocra use darts to harass ground-based opponents.</p><p>If their opponents can fly, the aarakocra generally forgo the use of the net, although large groups sometimes use nets on flying creatures. Normally, aarakocra attack flying creatures with long spears, diving from above and allowing the momentum to carry the spear through the target. Such an attack doubles the damage if the aarakocra have been able to dive at least 50 feet. Only the very largest aarakocra can carry more than one of these spears, they can attack with both at once with no penalty, causing double damage on each strike. All diving attacks are made at +4 and should be treated as a charge attack. All other penalties and restrictions of charge attacks apply.</p><p>The effect of the aarakocra's nets depends on if the opponent is flying at the time it becomes entangled. Creatures on the ground that are hit by a net are entangled and unable to participate in any combat until they make a successful Strength check to get free of the net. Flying creatures hit by a net can no longer fly and immediately begin falling. If they cannot escape the net or use some magical means to arrest the fall, normal falling damage applies.</p><p>Unless victims are entangled in nets, aarakocra are cautious in ground combat. If the aarakocra outnumber their opponents they advance in a straight line and thrust with their spears. If outnumbered, or the opponents are particularly tough, the aarakocra withdraw. Victims entangled in nets are killed or incapacitated for use as food or ransom.</p><p>Athasian aarakocra are mindful of their physical limitations as well as their comparatively low psionic abilities. They do not normally initiate psionic combat. At the first sign of psionic powers from any of their victims, however, all aarakocra that have some ability will use whatever attack and defense modes they can in an attempt to destroy the threat. Large groups of is or more aarakocra may initiate psionic combat if their leaders feel they can win quickly and avoid physical combat.</p><p>In desperation, an aarakocra can attempt to bite an opponent in combat. Because of the unwieldiness of its beak, the aarakocra has a THAC0 of 18 if attacking with this appendage. Further, the birdman causes only 1d2 points of damage with the beak.</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Habitat/Society:</b> Athasian aarakocra live in tribes with 6-20 (2d8+4) members, depending on the prestige of the leader. The largest tribe ever recorded had 50 members. The tribal hunting territory depends on the size of the tribe, usually about 500 square miles for a tribe of 10 members. There are no rigid boundaries between tribes and border disputes are not uncommon.</p><p>Alignments of tribe members are similar to the alignment of the leader. A tribe that has a leader who is neutral good may have neutral good, chaotic good, lawful good, and true neutral members. A predominantly evil tribe does not recognize boundaries with other tribes and treats other tribes as inferior beings to be eliminated.</p><p>Athasian aarakocra aren't happy in enclosed spaces, but they they take refuge in a cave or building if necessary.</p><p>Nonevil tribes live in rocky aeries in the highest peaks they can find. Evil tribes are normally nomadic and use an aerie made by another tribe if they need to remain in an area for a long time, even if they have to evict the tribe that made the nest.</p><p>Aarakocra aren't friendly toward intruders in their territory, especially caravans. They try to extract a toll from the caravan for passage through the desert. Good-aligned tribes allow unhindered passage of caravans that pay a tribute. If someone refuses to pay the tribute, the aarakocra try to capture scouts or outriders from the party and hold them until an even larger tribute is paid. The payment may be either livestock or shiny objects. Aarakocra are smart enough not to be taken in by glass baubles instead of gems, although they cannot tell the difference between the more common gems and the rare ones.</p><p>Evil tribes ask for tribute and often attack a caravan whether it pays or not. Aarakocra always demand shiny objects such as stones. These tribes find humans and demihumans to be quite tasty and prefer them to other food.</p><p>Good-aligned tribes of aarakocra sometimes return a lost traveler to the edge of the desert after first removing any valuables the traveler may be carrying. On very rare occasions a tribe might return a lost group of travelers to the more frequently traveled parts of the desert, again after first taking any valuables as payment.</p><p>The oldest male is the leader of the tribal hunting party and has 4+4 Hit Dice. The oldest female is in charge of the tribal aerie and has 3+3 HD. In tribes that have more than 15 members, the next oldest aarakocra serves as shaman and has 3+3 HD; the shaman completes the triumvirate necessary for proper worship and the summoning of elementals. (Interestingly, no magic-using aarakocra has ever been recorded.) Tribes without a shaman cannot summon <a href=\"/appendix/element1\">air elementals</a>, which is an important part of aarakocra culture.</p><p>The shaman is the leader of the daily sun worship. Aarakocra worship the sun because it provides them with the thermals they need to soar in search of food. The shaman also leads the mystic rituals used to summon an air elemental. Summoning an air elemental is usually done only in preparation for the tribe's most sacred ceremony, the hunt. Small tribes must band together for this ceremony to allow the triumvirate to be formed.</p><p>The ceremony to summon an air elemental must be conducted at dawn and requires the oldest male and female to emit a highpitched keening whistle. The shaman conducts an intricate dance around them, simultaneously chanting an ancient summoning mantra.</p><p>The hunt is the final part of the initiation of adolescent aarakocra to adulthood and often takes the tribe far from their normal teritory. The target is always a <a href=\"/appendix/drakalsi\">silt drake</a>. The hunt is the only time the females leave the relative safety of the nest. Even an evil tribe will not interfere with a tribe on a hunt. An air elemental is often summoned to help find the drake, but never takes part in the actual combat. Although the adult members of the tribe take part in the initial phases of the combat, it is the initiates who deliver the final, killing blows to me drake. Scars from the hunt are considered a mark of pride among all aarakocra.</p><p>The females spend about eight months of the year incubating their eggs. Athasian aarakocra mate for life and a pair normally produces as many as 10 offspring. A female lays one egg a year. Constant incubation is not required because of the high daytime temperatures, so the females can maintain the nest and keep the tribe's treasure in order.</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Ecology:</b> Athasian aarakocra are high on the food chain and have no natural enemies other than <a href=\"/appendix/drakatha\">drakes</a>. Unless evil, aarakocra leave their own territory only to hunt the silt drake and return as soon as possible when the hunt is over. (Evil aarakocra attack others, as noted above.) Aarakocra eggs and hatchlings are sought after by wealthy land owners who wish to use the creatures as scouts and sentries. An egg can bring as much as 10 cp in Tyr's marketplace. Tribes that have had eggs or hatchlings stolen have long memories and sometimes take revenge against the thief at a later date. Captive aarakocra join any tribe they come in contact with.</p><p>Athasian aarakocra have a natural life span of 21-30 years.</p>\n","images":["<img src=\"grf/ds.gif\" width=\"150\" height=\"75\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Dark Sun\" title=\"Dark Sun\" align=\"right\">","<img src=\"img/aarakath.gif\" alt=\"Aarakocra (Athas)\" title=\"Aarakocra (Athas)\" border=\"0\" width=\"300\" height=\"360\" style=\"text-align:right;\" align=\"right\">","<img src=\"grf/add2_01.gif\" width=\"200\" height=\"56\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Advanced Dungeons & Dragons 2nd Edition\">"],"setting":"Dark Sun","statblock":{"Aarakocra (Athas)":{"Activity Cycle":"Day","Alignment":"Any","Armor Class":"7","Climate/Terrain":"Deep desert","Damage/Attack":"1d3/1d3 or by weapon","Diet":"Carnivore","Frequency":"Rare","Hit Dice":"2+2","Intelligence":"Average (8-10)","Magic Resistance":"Nil","Morale":"Steady (11)","Movement":"6, Fl 36 (C)","No. Appearing":"1d10","No. of Attacks":"2","Organization":"Tribal","Size":"M (20'+ wingspan)","Special Attacks":"Nil","Special Defenses":"Nil","THAC0":"17","Treasure":"Varies","XP Value":"65"}},"title":"Aarakocra (Athas)"},"sources":["2433"],"statblock_names":[],"title":"Aarakocra (Athas)","prev_key":"zygraat","next_key":"aarakocr","monster_path":"/appendix/aarakath"}}},"pageContext":{"monster_key":"aboleths","monster_data":{"TSR":["2158","1125"],"fullBody":"  <table cellspacing=\"0\" cellpadding=\"0\"><tr><th>Climate/Terrain:</th><td>Subterranean</td></tr><tr><th>Frequency:</th><td>Very rare</td></tr><tr><th>Organization:</th><td>Brood/Community</td></tr><tr><th>Activity Cycle:</th><td>Any (night)</td></tr><tr><th>Diet:</th><td>Omnivore</td></tr><tr><th>Intelligence:</th><td>Exceptional to Supra-genius (15-19)</td></tr><tr><th>Treasure:</th><td>Nil (F, U)</td></tr><tr><th>Alignment:</th><td>Lawful evil</td></tr><tr><th>No. Appearing:</th><td>1</td></tr><tr><th>Armor Class:</th><td>2</td></tr><tr><th>Movement:</th><td>3, Sw 18</td></tr><tr><th>Hit Dice:</th><td>12+12</td></tr><tr><th>THAC0:</th><td>7</td></tr><tr><th>No. of Attacks:</th><td>4</td></tr><tr><th>Damage/Attack:</th><td>1d6 + special (x4)</td></tr><tr><th>Special Attacks:</th><td>Spells, aboleth glyphs, frenzy, domination, tentacle toxin</td></tr><tr><th>Special Defenses:</th><td>Spells, aboleth glyphs, slime, mucus cloud, detect invisible (75% chance within 60')</td></tr><tr><th>Magic Resistance:</th><td>Nil</td></tr><tr><th>Size:</th><td>H (20' long)</td></tr><tr><th>Morale:</th><td>Champion (16)</td></tr><tr><th>XP Value:</th><td>13,000<br>Spellcaster 9+ level 14,000<br><i>Comp.

Physically they resemble ordinary aboleth. However, the bony ridges of a savant aboleth head are unusually prominent and constitute a virtual armoring of the creature's slightly oversized cranium. Its tentacles are very tough and leathery, with calcified nodules along their surfaces. Together, these help to give the savant aboleth its superior Armor Class rating. Like all aboleth, savant aboleth are amphibious.</p><p>Savant aboleth can cast spells as both priests and wizards. They can attain 12th level as priests and 14th level as wizards. While ordinary aboleth may become priests of Juiblex the Slime Lord or of the aboleth Power known as the Blood Queen, savant aboleth primarily revere the Blood Queen. As priests, savant aboleth can use spells from any of the following spheres: all, charm, divination, elemental (air, earth, water), guardian, law, protection, summoning, sun (reversed, minor access only), and weather. As wizards, they very rarely specialize, though a small number take advantage of their race's natural affinity with enchantment/charm spells and effects to become specialist Enchanters. Nonspecialist savant aboleth have certain restrictions on spell use. They cannot use any form of fire-based or fire-affecting spell. Furthermore, they can only employ necromancy spells with difficulty (+2 bonus to the victim's saving throws) and are limited to spells from this school of 4th level or below.</p><table class=\"ip\"><tr class=\"bk\"><th>1d100</th><th>Priest Level</th><th>Wizard Level</th></tr><tr><td>01-03</td><td>1d4</td><td>1d4</td></tr><tr><td>04-10</td><td>1d4+1</td><td>1d4+1</td></tr><tr><td>11-25</td><td>1d6+1</td><td>1d6+1</td></tr><tr><td>26-40</td><td>1d6+2</td><td>1d6+2</td></tr><tr><td>41-60</td><td>1d4+5</td><td>1d4+6</td></tr><tr><td>61-80</td><td>1d4+6</td><td>1d6+6</td></tr><tr><td>81-90</td><td>1d4+8</td><td>1d6+8</td></tr><tr><td>91-99</td><td>1d3+9</td><td>1d4+10</td></tr><tr><td>00</td><td>1d2+10</td><td>1d3+11</td></tr></table><p>The Intelligence score of a savant aboleth is determined by rolling 1d5+14. The Wisdom score of the creature is determined by rolling 1d4+14. To randomly determine the spellcasting power of a savant aboleth, roll 1d100 twice and consult the table. However, the lower rating should always be adjusted upwards (if necessary) so that it is no more than three levels lower than the higher rating. For example, if the random rolls create a savant aboleth as a 10th-level priest and 5th-level wizard, increase the wizard rating to 7th level.</p><p>Savant aboleth are rare. Aboleth are few to begin with, and no more than 2% or so of these creatures possess the exceptional mental gifts required to become a savant. It may be that the savant aboleth are correct in their view that the Blood Queen deliberately chooses few of her creatures to bless with the skills of the savant.</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Combat:</b> Savant aboleth are 75% likely to detect invisible creatures or objects within 60 feet. The savant aboleth always attempts to use spells and its domination power rather than melee. If forced into melee, it fights in the same way as any ordinary aboleth: a single touch from a tentacle and a failed saving throw vs. spell turns the victim's skin to a clear membrane in only 1d4+1 rounds; thereafter he or she must remain immersed in cool water or suffer 1d12 points of damage per turn. <i>Cure disease</i> can stop the process; once completed it can be reversed by <i>cure serious wounds</i>.</p><p>The savant aboleth is a more formidable enslaver than it ordinary kindred. Like them it can make three attempts per day to enslave creatures by <i>domination</i>, one creature per attempt, but the range of this attack is 30 yards and the target suffers a -2 penalty to the saving throw vs. spell to resist the effect. Moreover, the enslavement is complete, and the dominated creature will fight for the savant aboleth if so commanded. Any telepathic instruction from the savant aboleth to engage in a course of action which is clearly suicidal (and the Intelligence of the victim has to be taken into account here) allows the victim a  fresh saving throw vs. spell, without penalty, to free himself or herself from the <i>domination</i>. The enslavement can be undone by a sucsessful <i>dispel magic</i> (cast against a level of spell use equal to the highest level rating for the aboleth in priest or wizard class), <i>remove curse</i>, or by separating the victim from the savant by a distance of one mile or more, which permits a fresh saving throw without penalty each full day the separation is maintained. Note that, because the <i>domination</i> effect of the savant is so complete, these creatures are likely to have powerful creatures accompanying them as bodyguards - savant aboleth are fully cognizant of their unpopularity among <q>lesser races</q> and take suitable precautions. Any aboleth fighting to protect the life of a savant has a morale of 19 as long as the savant survives.</p><p>Underwater, the savant aboleth has the same mucus cloud protection, with the same effects, as ordinary aboleth (anyone within a foot of the aboleth who fails a saving throw vs. poison loses the ability to breathe air, suffocating in 2d6 rounds if he or she tries; the cloud also bestows the ability to breathe water for 1 to 3 hours).</p><p>Finally, the savant aboleth will go into a frenzy if close to death (12 hit points or below). In this state, which automatically supervenes at this time, the savant cannot cast spells or use any spell-like power. However, its tentacle attacks cause double damage (2d6) and the enraged, despairing creature will even attempt a head-smash attack each round, ramming with the bony protrusions on its forehead. This attack is clumsy (-4 penalty to the attack roll) but can affect up to two M size (or three S size) opponents. Damage from this head smash is 4d6 hit points, and a smashed opponent must make a Dexterity check or be kicked off his or her feet and stunned for 1d3 rounds. Once in a frenzy, the savant will not recover its normal demeanor until it has killed all opponents visible to it.</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Habitat/Society:</b> Savant aboleth are highly arrogant creatures. Cabals of savant aboleth organize and run aboleth society, playing the role of rulers and dominators from within their great cities. They rarely leave the city of their dwelling, sending ordinary aboleth out to do the dirty work of capturing slaves and the task of collecting food for the savants, while they brood long and deeply in their domains. Young savants born elsewhere leave their broods virtually as soon as they are capable of independence, believing themselves to be guided by the Blood Queen to the great cities of the aboleth deep in the Underdark. Sometimes, older savants will travel to a brood to take acquisition of a young aboleth which has latent savant gifts. This is one of the few occasions when savants leave their cities, but leave they sometimes must, for savant aboleth are infertile and do not produce young of their own.</p><p>Savant aboleth are always hungry for magical items and lore. They do not require spellbooks for their wizard spells; memorized spells are recalled automatically during periods of rest and sleep and do not need to be relearned from any independent source. Young savants may spend days or weeks in telepathic communion with their elders and betters, the older savants passing on their mastery of magical skills and their knowledge of dark, arcane secrets. Savant aboleth are always eager to devour spellcasters and magic-using creatures, the better to improve their own understanding of magic.</p><p>Savant aboleth have a complex symbolic glyph system they use for all written communication. Those who are of 7th or higher level in either the priest or wizard class can create magical glyph by psychokinetic force, one glyph per day. Casting time is two turns plus one turn per additional glyph element (see below), so this is not a likely potential combat action. The total number of glyph-elements a savant aboleth can maintain at any one time equals its Intelligence score.</p><p>Savant aboleth glyphs come in four categories: <i>simple glyphs</i>, <i>complex glyphs</i>, <i>master glyphs</i>, and <i>complex master glyphs</i>. <i>Simple glyphs</i> are identical to <i>glyphs of warding</i>. <i>Complex glyphs </i>combine the effects of two <i>glyphs of warding </i>&ndash; for example, an aboleth <i>complex glyph</i> might inflict cold damage and also cause paralysis. <i>Master glyphs</i> (each of which counts as a three-element glyph for the purposes of the savant aboleth's glyph limit) have unique effects. The following are a few examples of <i>master glyphs</i>:</p><ul><li><i>The Glyph of Law.</i> Within 30 feet of this glyph, all creatures of nonlawful alignment are subject to an adverse <i>prayer</i> effect (-1 to all attack, damage, and saving throw rolls).</li><li><i>The Glyph of Enfeeblement.</i> Within 20 feet of this glyph, all non-aboleth feel themselves weakened and debilitated, suffering -3 penalties to Strength, Dexterity, and Constitution until leaving the area of effect and for 1d4 rounds thereafter.</li><li><i>The Glyph of Extension.</i> Any aboleth within 20 feet of this glyph has double the normal range for its <i>domination</i> power.</li><li><i>The Glyph of the Slime Curse.</i> Within 30 feet of this glyph, saving throws against the transformational effect of an aboleth's tentacle are made at a -4 penalty and transformation occurs in but a single round.</li></ul><p>Finally, great savant-aboleth of exceptional mastery (18 or higher Wisdom and Intelligence, 10th level or above as both priests and wizards) can create <i>complex master glyphs</i> which add an extra element onto a master glyph (for example, a <i>glyph of enfeeblement</i> which also does cold damage); these <i>complex master glyphs</i> can even include effects from different schools. <i>Complex master glyphs</i> still only count as three glyphs for the purpose of determining the limit on the number of glyphs the savant can maintain at any one time, but they require six turns to create.</p><p>Aboleth glyphs of all kinds can be removed by a successful <i>dispel magic</i> cast against the highest level rating for the savant aboleth which created them. Saving throws are permitted against the effects of all these glyphs, but saving throws against the effects of a <i>master glyph</i> are made with a -1 penalty; against <i>complex master glyphs</i> the penalty is -2. Only one saving throw is permitted against the whole battery of magical effects radiated by a <i>master glyph</i> or a <i>complex master glyph</i>.</p><p>This glyphic skill is central to the savant's position within aboleth society. Being very lawful, ordinary aboleth acquiesce to the greater power of the savants as a matter of course, but this ability to defend and protect the aboleth city with a battery of <i>complex glyphs</i> earns the savant aboleth the loyalty and respect of ordinary aboleth.</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Ecology:</b> Savant aboleth are either supreme beings at the top of their food chain or bloated parasites consuming food and resources gathered by slaves and lackeys, depending on one's point of view. Their diet is the same as that of ordinary aboleth &ndash; algae, fish, diverse water plants, and the like &ndash; but they have an especial liking for the flesh of spellcasters and magic-using creatures, as noted above. Savant aboleth have no natural enemies. Virtually all intelligent marine life knows well enough to give them an extremely wide berth.</p>\n","images":["<img src=\"grf/xx.gif\" width=\"150\" height=\"75\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Advanced Dungeons & Dragons 2nd Edition\" title=\"Advanced Dungeons & Dragons 2nd Edition\" align=\"right\">","<img src=\"img/aboleths.gif\" alt=\"Aboleth, Savant\" title=\"Aboleth, Savant\" border=\"0\" width=\"300\" height=\"360\" style=\"text-align:right;\" align=\"right\">","<img src=\"grf/tsr_sm.png\" width=\"56\" height=\"59\" border=\"0\" alt=\"TSR\">"],"setting":"Advanced Dungeons & Dragons 2nd Edition","statblock":{"Aboleth, Savant":{"Activity Cycle":"Any (night)","Alignment":"Lawful evil","Armor Class":"2","Climate/Terrain":"Subterranean","Damage/Attack":"1d6 + special (x4)","Diet":"Omnivore","Frequency":"Very rare","Hit Dice":"12+12","Intelligence":"Exceptional to Supra-genius (15-19)","Magic Resistance":"Nil","Morale":"Champion (16)","Movement":"3, Sw 18","No. Appearing":"1","No. of Attacks":"4","Organization":"Brood/Community","Size":"H (20' long)","Special Attacks":"Spells, aboleth glyphs, frenzy, domination, tentacle toxin","Special Defenses":"Spells, aboleth glyphs, slime, mucus cloud, detect invisible (75% chance within 60')","THAC0":"7","Treasure":"Nil (F, U)","XP Value":"13,000<br>Spellcaster 9+ level 14,000<br><i>Comp.
