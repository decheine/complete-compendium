While the powers listed above are the most common, some aarakocra have different or additional powers.</p><p class=\"f\">A race of intelligent, birdlike creatures living in the deepest deserts of Athas, the rare Athasian <a href=\"/appendix/aarakocr\">aarakocra</a> spends its time soaring on thermals in search of food.</p><p>The aarakocra is 7 to 8 feet tall with a wingspan of 20 feet or more. Because of its large wingspan, an aarakocra can carry as much as 75% of its own body weight and still fly easily. An aarakocra can fly a short distance carrying a burden equaling 125% of its own body weight. The average body weight of a full grown male is 100 pounds and a female is 85 pounds.</p><p>Each wing has a &ldquo;hand&rdquo; at its midpoint, consisting of three fingers and an opposable thumb. The fourth finger forms the rigid leading edge of the wing. In flight the hands cannot be used, but on the ground the aarakocra can use its hands almost as a human would. The aarakocra's body is protected by a thin bony plate on the chest, much like a solid rib cage. Talons on its legs can be used as claws and can be retracted to reveal a second set of hands, also with three fingers and an opposable thumb. Except for the chest plate, the entire skeleton is hollow and extremely fragile.</p><p>From a distance, the Athasian aarakocra resembles a huge <a href=\"/appendix/bird\">vulture</a>. Its black eyes, set in the front of the head, provide excellent vision over a long range. The plumage is generally black with a white collar for adult males and black or brown with a smaller white collar for females. Adolescents are a mixture of brown and black. The beak is large and covers most of the head. Plumage begins at the crown of the head and is darker near the head, except for the collar. Athasian aarakocra speak their own language and the languages of vultures and other large birds. Some speak the common tongue (5% to 10% chance depending on how deep in the wastelands a tribe lives).</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Combat:</b> Aarakocra can fight in the air or on the ground. They prefer aerial combat since their bones are too fragile to withstand a solid blow from a human-sized opponent. In combat against creatures on the ground, they prefer to fly over their victim and drop weighted nets. Some aarakocra use darts to harass ground-based opponents.</p><p>If their opponents can fly, the aarakocra generally forgo the use of the net, although large groups sometimes use nets on flying creatures. Normally, aarakocra attack flying creatures with long spears, diving from above and allowing the momentum to carry the spear through the target. Such an attack doubles the damage if the aarakocra have been able to dive at least 50 feet. Only the very largest aarakocra can carry more than one of these spears, they can attack with both at once with no penalty, causing double damage on each strike. All diving attacks are made at +4 and should be treated as a charge attack. All other penalties and restrictions of charge attacks apply.</p><p>The effect of the aarakocra's nets depends on if the opponent is flying at the time it becomes entangled. Creatures on the ground that are hit by a net are entangled and unable to participate in any combat until they make a successful Strength check to get free of the net. Flying creatures hit by a net can no longer fly and immediately begin falling. If they cannot escape the net or use some magical means to arrest the fall, normal falling damage applies.</p><p>Unless victims are entangled in nets, aarakocra are cautious in ground combat. If the aarakocra outnumber their opponents they advance in a straight line and thrust with their spears. If outnumbered, or the opponents are particularly tough, the aarakocra withdraw. Victims entangled in nets are killed or incapacitated for use as food or ransom.</p><p>Athasian aarakocra are mindful of their physical limitations as well as their comparatively low psionic abilities. They do not normally initiate psionic combat. At the first sign of psionic powers from any of their victims, however, all aarakocra that have some ability will use whatever attack and defense modes they can in an attempt to destroy the threat. Large groups of is or more aarakocra may initiate psionic combat if their leaders feel they can win quickly and avoid physical combat.</p><p>In desperation, an aarakocra can attempt to bite an opponent in combat. Because of the unwieldiness of its beak, the aarakocra has a THAC0 of 18 if attacking with this appendage. Further, the birdman causes only 1d2 points of damage with the beak.</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Habitat/Society:</b> Athasian aarakocra live in tribes with 6-20 (2d8+4) members, depending on the prestige of the leader. The largest tribe ever recorded had 50 members. The tribal hunting territory depends on the size of the tribe, usually about 500 square miles for a tribe of 10 members. There are no rigid boundaries between tribes and border disputes are not uncommon.</p><p>Alignments of tribe members are similar to the alignment of the leader. A tribe that has a leader who is neutral good may have neutral good, chaotic good, lawful good, and true neutral members. A predominantly evil tribe does not recognize boundaries with other tribes and treats other tribes as inferior beings to be eliminated.</p><p>Athasian aarakocra aren't happy in enclosed spaces, but they they take refuge in a cave or building if necessary.</p><p>Nonevil tribes live in rocky aeries in the highest peaks they can find. Evil tribes are normally nomadic and use an aerie made by another tribe if they need to remain in an area for a long time, even if they have to evict the tribe that made the nest.</p><p>Aarakocra aren't friendly toward intruders in their territory, especially caravans. They try to extract a toll from the caravan for passage through the desert. Good-aligned tribes allow unhindered passage of caravans that pay a tribute. If someone refuses to pay the tribute, the aarakocra try to capture scouts or outriders from the party and hold them until an even larger tribute is paid. The payment may be either livestock or shiny objects. Aarakocra are smart enough not to be taken in by glass baubles instead of gems, although they cannot tell the difference between the more common gems and the rare ones.</p><p>Evil tribes ask for tribute and often attack a caravan whether it pays or not. Aarakocra always demand shiny objects such as stones. These tribes find humans and demihumans to be quite tasty and prefer them to other food.</p><p>Good-aligned tribes of aarakocra sometimes return a lost traveler to the edge of the desert after first removing any valuables the traveler may be carrying. On very rare occasions a tribe might return a lost group of travelers to the more frequently traveled parts of the desert, again after first taking any valuables as payment.</p><p>The oldest male is the leader of the tribal hunting party and has 4+4 Hit Dice. The oldest female is in charge of the tribal aerie and has 3+3 HD. In tribes that have more than 15 members, the next oldest aarakocra serves as shaman and has 3+3 HD; the shaman completes the triumvirate necessary for proper worship and the summoning of elementals. (Interestingly, no magic-using aarakocra has ever been recorded.) Tribes without a shaman cannot summon <a href=\"/appendix/element1\">air elementals</a>, which is an important part of aarakocra culture.</p><p>The shaman is the leader of the daily sun worship. Aarakocra worship the sun because it provides them with the thermals they need to soar in search of food. The shaman also leads the mystic rituals used to summon an air elemental. Summoning an air elemental is usually done only in preparation for the tribe's most sacred ceremony, the hunt. Small tribes must band together for this ceremony to allow the triumvirate to be formed.</p><p>The ceremony to summon an air elemental must be conducted at dawn and requires the oldest male and female to emit a highpitched keening whistle. The shaman conducts an intricate dance around them, simultaneously chanting an ancient summoning mantra.</p><p>The hunt is the final part of the initiation of adolescent aarakocra to adulthood and often takes the tribe far from their normal teritory. The target is always a <a href=\"/appendix/drakalsi\">silt drake</a>. The hunt is the only time the females leave the relative safety of the nest. Even an evil tribe will not interfere with a tribe on a hunt. An air elemental is often summoned to help find the drake, but never takes part in the actual combat. Although the adult members of the tribe take part in the initial phases of the combat, it is the initiates who deliver the final, killing blows to me drake. Scars from the hunt are considered a mark of pride among all aarakocra.</p><p>The females spend about eight months of the year incubating their eggs. Athasian aarakocra mate for life and a pair normally produces as many as 10 offspring. A female lays one egg a year. Constant incubation is not required because of the high daytime temperatures, so the females can maintain the nest and keep the tribe's treasure in order.</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Ecology:</b> Athasian aarakocra are high on the food chain and have no natural enemies other than <a href=\"/appendix/drakatha\">drakes</a>. Unless evil, aarakocra leave their own territory only to hunt the silt drake and return as soon as possible when the hunt is over. (Evil aarakocra attack others, as noted above.) Aarakocra eggs and hatchlings are sought after by wealthy land owners who wish to use the creatures as scouts and sentries. An egg can bring as much as 10 cp in Tyr's marketplace. Tribes that have had eggs or hatchlings stolen have long memories and sometimes take revenge against the thief at a later date. Captive aarakocra join any tribe they come in contact with.</p><p>Athasian aarakocra have a natural life span of 21-30 years.</p><br clear=\"all\" style=\"clear:both; height:0;\">\r\n","images":["<img src=\"grf/ds.gif\" width=\"150\" height=\"75\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Dark Sun\" title=\"Dark Sun\" align=\"right\">","<img src=\"img/aarakath.gif\" alt=\"Aarakocra (Athas)\" title=\"Aarakocra (Athas)\" border=\"0\" width=\"300\" height=\"360\" style=\"text-align:right;\" align=\"right\">","<img src=\"grf/add2_01.gif\" width=\"200\" height=\"56\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Advanced Dungeons & Dragons 2nd Edition\">"],"setting":"Dark Sun","statblock":{"Aarakocra (Athas)":{"Activity Cycle":"Day","Alignment":"Any","Armor Class":"7","Climate/Terrain":"Deep desert","Damage/Attack":"1d3/1d3 or by weapon","Diet":"Carnivore","Frequency":"Rare","Hit Dice":"2+2","Intelligence":"Average (8-10)","Magic Resistance":"Nil","Morale":"Steady (11)","Movement":"6, Fl 36 (C)","No. Appearing":"1d10","No. of Attacks":"2","Organization":"Tribal","Size":"M (20'+ wingspan)","Special Attacks":"Nil","Special Defenses":"Nil","THAC0":"17","Treasure":"Varies","XP Value":"65"}},"title":"Aarakocra (Athas)"},"sources":["2433"],"statblock_names":[],"title":"Aarakocra (Athas)","prev_key":"zygraat","next_key":"aarakocr","monster_path":"/appendix/aarakath"}}},"pageContext":{"monster_key":"lizmankr","monster_data":{"TSR":["2105"],"fullBody":"  <table cellspacing=\"0\" cellpadding=\"0\"><tr class=\"bk\"><th> </th><th class=\"cn\">Jarak-Sinn</th><th class=\"cn\">Bakali</th></tr><tr><th>Climate/Terrain:</th><td>Tropical, subtropical, and temperate/swamp</td><td> Tropical and subtropical/swamp</td></tr><tr><th>Frequency:</th><td>Rare</td><td>Very rare</td></tr><tr><th>Organization:</th><td>Tribe</td><td>Tribe</td></tr><tr><th>Activity Cycle:</th><td>Any</td><td>Any</td></tr><tr><th>Diet:</th><td>Omnivore</td><td>Omnivore</td></tr><tr><th>Intelligence:</th><td>Low (5-7)</td><td>Average (8-10)</td></tr><tr><th>Treasure:</th><td>D</td><td>J,K</td></tr><tr><th>Alignment:</th><td>Neutral (evil)</td><td>Neutral (evil)</td></tr><tr><th>No. Appearing:</th><td>10-40</td><td>1-10</td></tr><tr><th>Armor Class:</th><td>5</td><td>7</td></tr><tr><th>Movement:</th><td>6, Sw 12</td><td>9, Sw 9</td></tr><tr><th>Hit Dice:</th><td>2+1</td><td>2+1</td></tr><tr><th>THAC0:</th><td>19</td><td>19</td></tr><tr><th>No. of Attacks:</th><td>3 or 1</td><td>3 or 1</td></tr><tr><th>Damage/Attack:</th><td>1-2/1-2/1-6 (claw/claw/bite) or 1-4 (tail) or by weapon</td><td>1-2/1-2/1-6 or 1-4 or by weapon</td></tr><tr><th>Special Attacks:</th><td>Venom</td><td>Squirt blood</td></tr><tr><th>Special Defenses:</th><td>See below</td><td>See below</td></tr><tr><th>Magic Resistance:</th><td>Nil</td><td>Nil</td></tr><tr><th>Size:</th><td>L (7' tall)</td><td>M (6-8' tall)</td></tr><tr><th>Morale:</th><td>Elite (13)</td><td>Champion (15)</td></tr><tr><th>XP Value:</th><td>270</td><td>175</td></tr></table><p class=\"f\">Jarak-sinn are a vile race of <a href=\"/appendix/lizarman\">lizard men</a> devoted to the worship of Chislev. All civilized races avoid associating with the vulgar, vicious, foul jarak.sinn. The bakali are the forefathers of the jarak-sinn; though not as numerous as the jarak-sinn, a few communities of bakali still remain in Ansalon, with more in Taladas.</p><h2>Jarak-Sinn</h2><p class=\"f\">Jarak-sinn are stoop-shouldered, thick-bodied creatures covered from head to toe with thin, green scales. A bony ridge extends from their broad snouts, between their eyes, and runs down their spines. They have whip-like tails, which average four to five feet long. They have sharp, hooked teeth and long claws on their hands and feet. Their small eyes are either red or pink in color, and their eyelids are clear, giving them the appearance of always having their eyes open. Thick pink tongues nearly two feet long dangle limply from the sides of their mouths: unlike <a href=\"/appendix/snake\">snakes</a> and other reptiles, their tongues have no sensory functions.</p><p>Jarak-sinn wear few clothes. The king, knights, and priests wear thick leather collars, respectively studded with gems, copper bands, and chunks of bone to distinguish them from the rest of the tribe. Many jarak.sinn wear bone necklaces and bracelets. Others etch crude tattoos into their scales using red-hot dagger blades.</p><p>Their language consists of short bursts of hisses, growls, and rasps. About 15% of the jarak.sinn can understand common language, and about 5% can make themselves understood to other intelligent races, albeit on a rudimentary level.</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Combat:</b> Jarak-sinn love combat and eagerly embrace every opportunity to engage in bloodshed. Though jarak-sinn pride themselves on their combat skills, they are by no means sophisticated fighters. A typical assault amounts to little more than a forward charge followed by fierce melee. If jarak.sinn face clearly superior opponents, they may refrain from charging, lurking in the shadows or other cover until they can ambush their victims from behind.</p><p>In addition to their claw and bite attacks, jarak-sinn use a variety of weapons, short swords and long swords being their favorites. They also use daggers javelins, and clubs studded with sharp pieces of bone (to cause 2d4 points of damage). They never wear armor, but occasionally employ small shields to raise their AC to 4.</p><p>The jarak-sinn's spittle is a thick, acidic venom that inflicts burns on all creatures other than lizard men. They sometimes coat their weapons with this venomous spittle, victims struck with a spittle-coated weapon must roll successful saving throws vs. poison or suffer an additional 1d4 points of damage. Since they lack the necessary jaw muscles, jarak-sinn are unable to spew their spittle at opponents.</p><p>A jarak-sinn can strike opponents from behind, using its tail like a whip to inflict 1d4 points of damage. A jarak-sinn can detach this appendage at will; if an opponent grabs his tail, the opponent may find himself struggling with a writhing tail while the jarak-sinn flees to safety A new tail can be grown in 1d4+8 weeks.</p><p>About 15% of jarak-sinn have two loose flaps of skin on either side of their necks that they can inflate to the size of three-foot-diameter balloons, these swellings are sometimes effective in discouraging predators. About 25% of jarak.sinn tan emit loud hisses to frighten opponents; although most intelligent opponents are not impressed with these sounds, unintelligent animals often associate the sounds with those made by poisonous snakes or small dragons, thus making them think twice before attacking.</p><p>Jarak.sinn occasionally ride <a href=\"/appendix/lizard\">giant lizards</a> into battle. The notoriously uncooperative lizards obey only the simplest of commands, but they are effective mounts when jarak-sinn are attacking opponents the lizards perceive as edible. The lizards relentlessly pursue such opponents, gobbling them up as soon as they run them down.</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Habitat/Society:</b> When the gods created the <a href=\"/appendix/dragon\">dragons</a>, the <a href=\"/appendix/elf\">elves</a>, and other races at the dawn of time, Chislev decided to create his own race for the specific purpose of worshiping him. Thus were born the bakali, a race of loathsome lizard men that crawled from the Great Moors of northern Ansalon and proceeded to establish small colonies in swamps and tropical regions throughout the land. The other races of Krynn, however, did not take kindly to the bakali; though not particularly aggressive, bakali habitually kidnapped innocent citizens to sacrifice to Chislev. Bakali were no match for the more intelligent and better-armed races. They were eventually forced to withdraw to Ansalon.s most desolate swamps, from which they ventured only rarely.</p><p>Adding to the bakali's problems were their diminishing numbers. While the other races grew and flourished, the bakali population could barely sustain itself; war and disease both took their toll. Additionally, bakali females produced only a single egg every five years. Desperately, the bakali petitioned Chislev for help. Chislev responded by creating a new species of lizard men he called the jarak-sinn; for the next 50 years, all offspring of female bakali were members of this more prolific species.</p><p>When they matured, female jarak.sinn gave birth to their own offspring at the rate of 10-20 per year. The number of jarak-sinn soon matched, then exceeded, the number of bakali.</p><p>But as the population of jarak-sinn grew, so did conflicts with the bakali. The first jarak-sinn leader of note - an ambitious, scheming male named Krazak - organized a revolt against the bakali. All bakali the jarak-sinn could find were rounded up and systematically executed. Some bakali managed to escape, fleeing in crude boats to the open sea. Eventually these last remnants of the bakali race came upon the continent of Taladas. Once there they quickly established themselves in Blackwater Glade and began to grow in numbers in the relative safety of that dismal swamp. Rumors persist that there are still some bakali yet alive in Ansalon, as the rulers of the less-intelligent jarak-sinn recognize their usefulness as advisors.</p><p>Jarak-sinn settlements have few of the elements normally associated with a civilized society. There are no formal laws - all decisions are made by the king, whose judgments can be as arbitrary as they are cruel. Homes are little more than mud pits or filth-strewn caves, which the jarak-sinn share with snakes, <a href=\"/appendix/rat\">rats</a>, and other vermin. Jarak.sinn lack the ambition to master any useable skills aside from those that are combat-related; consequently, a jarak-sinn settlement has no craftsmen, merchants, or artists.</p><p>A king seldom reigns more than a few years before he is assassinated; his assassin becomes the new king. The king always surrounds himself with 1d4+6 bodyguards, referred to as knights; knights are selected for their strength (they have a minimum of 15 hit points) and trustworthiness, although kings are usually assassinated by one of their own knights.</p><p>The community's shamans are in charge of conducting services in the name of Chislev. A shaman always has the spellcasting abilities of a 3rd.level shaman and has 1d4 acolytes with the spellcasting abilities of 1st.level shamans. There is usually one shaman for every 20 members of a tribe.</p><p>Tribal members who are not knights, shamans, or acolytes are all considered members of the community militia - all children capable of wielding a weapon (age 10 and up with a minimum of 5 hp) are considered mature enough to fight.</p><p>Jarak-sinn spend most of their time eating, sleeping, or cooling themselves in mud pits. When the dark moon of Nuitari is in High Sanction (full moon), which occurs for a seven-day period every month, the shamans lead the jarak-sinn in elaborate worship services to Chislev, involving chants, prayers, and numerous slave sacrifices.</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Ecology:</b> Though few know of the existence of the jarak-sinn, those who do despise and fear them. The shadowpeople, who occupy many of the underground caverns coveted by the jarak-sinn, especially hate them.</p><p>Jarak-sinn eat small mammals, algae and fungus, human flesh, and each other. They can unhinge their jaws to swallow large prey, such as sheep, though this process is time-consuming (up to four hours to swallow a sheep) and somewhat painful. Their sour flesh is inedible, as are their gelatinous eggs: hence, jarak-sinn are avoided by predators. Their hides can be re-worked by skilled armorers to make scale armor (AC 6).</p><h2>Bakali</h2><p class=\"f\">Bakali range from slightly shorter than most jarak-sinn to slightly taller. Their hides vary from yellow-green to mottled brown in color. Otherwise they are similar in appearance to the jarak-sinn. Although the bakali are the more intelligent species, the jarak-sinn consider them inferior in every respect.</p><p>Bakali are distrustful and suspicious by nature. They tend to keep to themselves and seldom leave their territories. To others they seem savage and cruel; as a race, they have no compunctions against violence, though individuals may hold more tolerant views.</p><p>Though frequently hostile to humans, bakali have a strong sense of honor. They remember both the good and the ill done to them, and they treat others as others treat them. They place great store in friendships, both among their own kind and with those of other races.</p><p>Although they are warm-blooded, bakali are vulnerable to cold and suffer 1 extra point of damage per die of damage caused by a cold-based attack. Their tough hides serve as the equivalent of AC 7. They are able to move equally well in the water and on land. Bakali do not possess infravision. They do have special nictating membranes that can quickly shield their eyes from harm. Thus they gain a +1 bonus to all saving throws against effects that involve blinding or dazzling of the eyes.</p><br clear=\"all\" style=\"clear:both; height:0;\">\r\n","images":["<img src=\"grf/dl.gif\" width=\"150\" height=\"75\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Dragonlance\" title=\"Dragonlance\" align=\"right\">","<img src=\"img/lizmankr.gif\" alt=\"Lizard Man (Krynn)\" title=\"Lizard Man (Krynn)\" border=\"0\" width=\"300\" height=\"360\" style=\"text-align:right;\" align=\"right\">","<img src=\"grf/add2_01.gif\" width=\"200\" height=\"56\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Advanced Dungeons & Dragons 2nd Edition\">"],"setting":"Dragonlance","statblock":{"Bakali":{"Activity Cycle":"Any","Alignment":"Neutral (evil)","Armor Class":"7","Climate/Terrain":" Tropical and subtropical/swamp","Damage/Attack":"1-2/1-2/1-6 or 1-4 or by weapon","Diet":"Omnivore","Frequency":"Very rare","Hit Dice":"2+1","Intelligence":"Average (8-10)","Magic Resistance":"Nil","Morale":"Champion (15)","Movement":"9, Sw 9","No. Appearing":"1-10","No. of Attacks":"3 or 1","Organization":"Tribe","Size":"M (6-8' tall)","Special Attacks":"Squirt blood","Special Defenses":"See below","THAC0":"19","Treasure":"J,K","XP Value":"175"},"Jarak-Sinn":{"Activity Cycle":"Any","Alignment":"Neutral (evil)","Armor Class":"5","Climate/Terrain":"Tropical, subtropical, and temperate/swamp","Damage/Attack":"1-2/1-2/1-6 (claw/claw/bite) or 1-4 (tail) or by weapon","Diet":"Omnivore","Frequency":"Rare","Hit Dice":"2+1","Intelligence":"Low (5-7)","Magic Resistance":"Nil","Morale":"Elite (13)","Movement":"6, Sw 12","No. Appearing":"10-40","No. of Attacks":"3 or 1","Organization":"Tribe","Size":"L (7' tall)","Special Attacks":"Venom","Special Defenses":"See below","THAC0":"19","Treasure":"D","XP Value":"270"}},"title":"Lizard Man (Krynn)"},"sources":["2105"],"statblock_names":[],"title":"Lizard Man (Krynn)","prev_key":"lizmanat","next_key":"locathah","monster_path":"/appendix/lizmankr"}},"staticQueryHashes":[],"slicesMap":{}}
