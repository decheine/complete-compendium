While the powers listed above are the most common, some aarakocra have different or additional powers.</p><p class=\"f\">A race of intelligent, birdlike creatures living in the deepest deserts of Athas, the rare Athasian <a href=\"/appendix/aarakocr\">aarakocra</a> spends its time soaring on thermals in search of food.</p><p>The aarakocra is 7 to 8 feet tall with a wingspan of 20 feet or more. Because of its large wingspan, an aarakocra can carry as much as 75% of its own body weight and still fly easily. An aarakocra can fly a short distance carrying a burden equaling 125% of its own body weight. The average body weight of a full grown male is 100 pounds and a female is 85 pounds.</p><p>Each wing has a &ldquo;hand&rdquo; at its midpoint, consisting of three fingers and an opposable thumb. The fourth finger forms the rigid leading edge of the wing. In flight the hands cannot be used, but on the ground the aarakocra can use its hands almost as a human would. The aarakocra's body is protected by a thin bony plate on the chest, much like a solid rib cage. Talons on its legs can be used as claws and can be retracted to reveal a second set of hands, also with three fingers and an opposable thumb. Except for the chest plate, the entire skeleton is hollow and extremely fragile.</p><p>From a distance, the Athasian aarakocra resembles a huge <a href=\"/appendix/bird\">vulture</a>. Its black eyes, set in the front of the head, provide excellent vision over a long range. The plumage is generally black with a white collar for adult males and black or brown with a smaller white collar for females. Adolescents are a mixture of brown and black. The beak is large and covers most of the head. Plumage begins at the crown of the head and is darker near the head, except for the collar. Athasian aarakocra speak their own language and the languages of vultures and other large birds. Some speak the common tongue (5% to 10% chance depending on how deep in the wastelands a tribe lives).</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Combat:</b> Aarakocra can fight in the air or on the ground. They prefer aerial combat since their bones are too fragile to withstand a solid blow from a human-sized opponent. In combat against creatures on the ground, they prefer to fly over their victim and drop weighted nets. Some aarakocra use darts to harass ground-based opponents.</p><p>If their opponents can fly, the aarakocra generally forgo the use of the net, although large groups sometimes use nets on flying creatures. Normally, aarakocra attack flying creatures with long spears, diving from above and allowing the momentum to carry the spear through the target. Such an attack doubles the damage if the aarakocra have been able to dive at least 50 feet. Only the very largest aarakocra can carry more than one of these spears, they can attack with both at once with no penalty, causing double damage on each strike. All diving attacks are made at +4 and should be treated as a charge attack. All other penalties and restrictions of charge attacks apply.</p><p>The effect of the aarakocra's nets depends on if the opponent is flying at the time it becomes entangled. Creatures on the ground that are hit by a net are entangled and unable to participate in any combat until they make a successful Strength check to get free of the net. Flying creatures hit by a net can no longer fly and immediately begin falling. If they cannot escape the net or use some magical means to arrest the fall, normal falling damage applies.</p><p>Unless victims are entangled in nets, aarakocra are cautious in ground combat. If the aarakocra outnumber their opponents they advance in a straight line and thrust with their spears. If outnumbered, or the opponents are particularly tough, the aarakocra withdraw. Victims entangled in nets are killed or incapacitated for use as food or ransom.</p><p>Athasian aarakocra are mindful of their physical limitations as well as their comparatively low psionic abilities. They do not normally initiate psionic combat. At the first sign of psionic powers from any of their victims, however, all aarakocra that have some ability will use whatever attack and defense modes they can in an attempt to destroy the threat. Large groups of is or more aarakocra may initiate psionic combat if their leaders feel they can win quickly and avoid physical combat.</p><p>In desperation, an aarakocra can attempt to bite an opponent in combat. Because of the unwieldiness of its beak, the aarakocra has a THAC0 of 18 if attacking with this appendage. Further, the birdman causes only 1d2 points of damage with the beak.</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Habitat/Society:</b> Athasian aarakocra live in tribes with 6-20 (2d8+4) members, depending on the prestige of the leader. The largest tribe ever recorded had 50 members. The tribal hunting territory depends on the size of the tribe, usually about 500 square miles for a tribe of 10 members. There are no rigid boundaries between tribes and border disputes are not uncommon.</p><p>Alignments of tribe members are similar to the alignment of the leader. A tribe that has a leader who is neutral good may have neutral good, chaotic good, lawful good, and true neutral members. A predominantly evil tribe does not recognize boundaries with other tribes and treats other tribes as inferior beings to be eliminated.</p><p>Athasian aarakocra aren't happy in enclosed spaces, but they they take refuge in a cave or building if necessary.</p><p>Nonevil tribes live in rocky aeries in the highest peaks they can find. Evil tribes are normally nomadic and use an aerie made by another tribe if they need to remain in an area for a long time, even if they have to evict the tribe that made the nest.</p><p>Aarakocra aren't friendly toward intruders in their territory, especially caravans. They try to extract a toll from the caravan for passage through the desert. Good-aligned tribes allow unhindered passage of caravans that pay a tribute. If someone refuses to pay the tribute, the aarakocra try to capture scouts or outriders from the party and hold them until an even larger tribute is paid. The payment may be either livestock or shiny objects. Aarakocra are smart enough not to be taken in by glass baubles instead of gems, although they cannot tell the difference between the more common gems and the rare ones.</p><p>Evil tribes ask for tribute and often attack a caravan whether it pays or not. Aarakocra always demand shiny objects such as stones. These tribes find humans and demihumans to be quite tasty and prefer them to other food.</p><p>Good-aligned tribes of aarakocra sometimes return a lost traveler to the edge of the desert after first removing any valuables the traveler may be carrying. On very rare occasions a tribe might return a lost group of travelers to the more frequently traveled parts of the desert, again after first taking any valuables as payment.</p><p>The oldest male is the leader of the tribal hunting party and has 4+4 Hit Dice. The oldest female is in charge of the tribal aerie and has 3+3 HD. In tribes that have more than 15 members, the next oldest aarakocra serves as shaman and has 3+3 HD; the shaman completes the triumvirate necessary for proper worship and the summoning of elementals. (Interestingly, no magic-using aarakocra has ever been recorded.) Tribes without a shaman cannot summon <a href=\"/appendix/element1\">air elementals</a>, which is an important part of aarakocra culture.</p><p>The shaman is the leader of the daily sun worship. Aarakocra worship the sun because it provides them with the thermals they need to soar in search of food. The shaman also leads the mystic rituals used to summon an air elemental. Summoning an air elemental is usually done only in preparation for the tribe's most sacred ceremony, the hunt. Small tribes must band together for this ceremony to allow the triumvirate to be formed.</p><p>The ceremony to summon an air elemental must be conducted at dawn and requires the oldest male and female to emit a highpitched keening whistle. The shaman conducts an intricate dance around them, simultaneously chanting an ancient summoning mantra.</p><p>The hunt is the final part of the initiation of adolescent aarakocra to adulthood and often takes the tribe far from their normal teritory. The target is always a <a href=\"/appendix/drakalsi\">silt drake</a>. The hunt is the only time the females leave the relative safety of the nest. Even an evil tribe will not interfere with a tribe on a hunt. An air elemental is often summoned to help find the drake, but never takes part in the actual combat. Although the adult members of the tribe take part in the initial phases of the combat, it is the initiates who deliver the final, killing blows to me drake. Scars from the hunt are considered a mark of pride among all aarakocra.</p><p>The females spend about eight months of the year incubating their eggs. Athasian aarakocra mate for life and a pair normally produces as many as 10 offspring. A female lays one egg a year. Constant incubation is not required because of the high daytime temperatures, so the females can maintain the nest and keep the tribe's treasure in order.</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Ecology:</b> Athasian aarakocra are high on the food chain and have no natural enemies other than <a href=\"/appendix/drakatha\">drakes</a>. Unless evil, aarakocra leave their own territory only to hunt the silt drake and return as soon as possible when the hunt is over. (Evil aarakocra attack others, as noted above.) Aarakocra eggs and hatchlings are sought after by wealthy land owners who wish to use the creatures as scouts and sentries. An egg can bring as much as 10 cp in Tyr's marketplace. Tribes that have had eggs or hatchlings stolen have long memories and sometimes take revenge against the thief at a later date. Captive aarakocra join any tribe they come in contact with.</p><p>Athasian aarakocra have a natural life span of 21-30 years.</p><p></p><br clear=\"all\" style=\"clear:both; height:0;\">\r\n","images":["<img src=\"grf/ds.gif\" width=\"150\" height=\"75\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Dark Sun\" title=\"Dark Sun\" align=\"right\">","<img src=\"img/aarakath.gif\" alt=\"Aarakocra (Athas)\" title=\"Aarakocra (Athas)\" border=\"0\" width=\"300\" height=\"360\" style=\"text-align:right;\" align=\"right\">","<img src=\"grf/add2_01.gif\" width=\"200\" height=\"56\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Advanced Dungeons & Dragons 2nd Edition\">"],"setting":"Dark Sun","statblock":{"Aarakocra (Athas)":{"Activity Cycle":"Day","Alignment":"Any","Armor Class":"7","Climate/Terrain":"Deep desert","Damage/Attack":"1d3/1d3 or by weapon","Diet":"Carnivore","Frequency":"Rare","Hit Dice":"2+2","Intelligence":"Average (8-10)","Magic Resistance":"Nil","Morale":"Steady (11)","Movement":"6, Fl 36 (C)","No. Appearing":"1d10","No. of Attacks":"2","Organization":"Tribal","Size":"M (20'+ wingspan)","Special Attacks":"Nil","Special Defenses":"Nil","THAC0":"17","Treasure":"Varies","XP Value":"65"}},"title":"Aarakocra (Athas)"},"sources":["2433"],"statblock_names":[],"title":"Aarakocra (Athas)","prev_key":"zygraat","next_key":"aarakocr","monster_path":"/appendix/aarakath"}}},"pageContext":{"monster_key":"thespide","monster_data":{"TSR":["3100"],"fullBody":"  <table cellspacing=\"0\" cellpadding=\"0\"><tr><th>Climate/Terrain:</th>  <td>The Spiderfell/Forests</td></tr><tr><th>Frequency:</th>        <td>Unique</td></tr><tr><th>Organization:</th>     <td>Solitary/Regent</td></tr><tr><th>Activity Cycle:</th>   <td>Any</td></tr><tr><th>Diet:</th>             <td>Carnivorous</td></tr><tr><th>Intelligence:</th>     <td>Very (11)</td></tr><tr><th>Treasure:</th>         <td>Domain Treasure (20-30 GB)</td></tr><tr><th>Alignment:</th>        <td>Chaotic evil</td></tr><tr><th>No. Appearing:</th>    <td>1</td></tr><tr><th>Armor Class:</th>      <td>-2 for carapace; 4 for underbelly</td></tr><tr><th>Movement:</th>         <td>15</td></tr><tr><th>Hit Dice:</th>         <td>13 HD (81 hit points)</td></tr><tr><th>THAC0:</th>            <td>7</td></tr><tr><th>No. of Attacks:</th>   <td>3 (claw/claw/bite) or 1 (web)</td></tr><tr><th>Damage/Attack:</th>    <td>1d10/1d10/1d6</td></tr><tr><th>Special Attacks:</th>  <td>Web, jump, poison</td></tr><tr><th>Special Defenses:</th> <td>Spittle, regeneration</td></tr><tr><th>Magic Resistance:</th> <td>15%</td></tr><tr><th>Size:</th>             <td>L (7' tall, 7' long)</td></tr><tr><th>Morale:</th>           <td>Fearless (20)</td></tr><tr><th>Blood:</th>            <td>True (Azrai): 95</td></tr><tr><th>Blood Abilities:</th>  <td>Animal affinity (spiders-great), Bloodform (great), Invulnerability (great), Long life (great), Major Regeneration (great), Std.

The goblins, who commanded sorcery and dabbled in powers beyond the ken of man, were a force to be reckoned with. Of all of them, Tal-Qazar was the mightiest. He was called the Spiderlord, for once his enemies were ensnared in his traps, they were doomed. He led armies of thousands of goblins and gnolls against the hated elves; many were the elven towers that fell beneath the booted feet of the Spiderlord's humanoids, and many were the elves that fell with poisoned arrows in their sides.</p><p>Eventually, Tal-Qazar claimed a large portion of the dark wood and called it the Spiderfell. At the same time, the Andu settlers who called themselves the Deretha drove the elves from the Erebannien. The Spiderlord crushed the elves as they fled, and only a few survived to reach safety in the elven homelands.</p><p>Tal-Qazar's goblins clashed frequently with the Deretha, until the day of Deismaar. The Spiderlord led a mighty host of goblins, and great was the destruction they wreaked along the way. However, the host was all but obliterated by the blast of the gods' destruction, and Tal-Qazar and a few pitiful survivors crept home. </p>\n<p>The Spiderlord had absorbed some of Azrai's essence, and be grew to realize the power at his disposal. He used this power to reestablish himself in the Spiderfell, and young goblins flocked to bis banner. As Tal-Qazar used his power to gain more money and more infamy for himself, Azrai's blood twisted him, bringing his spiderish nature to the fore./p>\n<p>Tal-Qazar, with no small surprise, soon found himself mutating into the bloated monstrosity that he is today. He tried everything within his reach to remain a normal goblin. However, no amount of surgery could permanently remove the additional legs that kept growing from his hips. No amount of cutting could reduce the spiderish abdomen that replaced his lower torso. The only sure way to halt the transformation was to stop using his blood abilities; if be tried that, the young goblins would try to seize power. And so the transformation continued apace, until the Spiderlord truly became the Spider.</p>\n<p>Meanwhile, the Anuireans were driving the goblins back into savagery. Much of goblin civilization was lost when the Anuireans cleared vast tracts of land, and while the Roele emperors could not destroy the Spider, they could contain it and its hordes. Goblin power nearly vanished from Anuire for a time.</p>\n<p>The Spider brooded in its wood, sending forth sallies of humanoids into the human lands only to watch them die. Its sanity frayed with each passing year, disappearing with its goblinoid essence.</p>\n<p>The Spider now appears as a gigantic, mottled, hairy spider with a muscled goblinoid upper body resting atop it. Its mouth is full of fangs, its ears are pointed, and its eyes are devoid of sanity. It can converse and be bargained with, but its temper swings wildly and it can kill a visitor without a second thought. It does have a twisted sense of honor, however, and it will keep its word-perhaps the last remnant of a once-noble goblin lord.</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Combat:</b> Though it is less powerful than the Gorgon and Rhuobhe Manslayer, the Spider is still a foe to be feared. It can scuttle rapidly from side to side, dodging blows all the while. When it attacks, it uses its two powerful clawed bands to swipe at an opponent, and follows with a nasty bite from razored teeth. If the Spider successfully bites an enemy, the opponent must make a saving throw vs. poison with a -2 penalty or fall dead on the spot. Even a successful save inflicts 20 points of damage.</p><p>The Spider can jump up to 30 feet in the air and land on a target 50 feet away with a successful attack roll. This is not a tactic it uses very often in combat, but is valuable for ambush or escape. Still, there are times when a good jump just seems right. ... </p><p>The awnshegh can string a web trail behind it or spin an intricate web. The web can cover an area 40x40x40 feet and holds creatures as the web spell. This web cannot be burned away, however. These webs dissolve after a day or two.</p><p>If the Spider is in a tight spot, it uses its blinding spittle to escape. This great gob of saliva can hit three people in a 10- foot radius with a successful attack roll on each, and it blinds victims for 1d6 turns. Unless a saving throw vs. poison is successful, this saliva also causes 1d6 damage after 1 round. It can be flushed away with water, but this alleviates only the damage, not the blindness.</p><p>The Spider regenerates at the rate of 1 hp per round. It can even regenerate from damage that takes it below -10 hit points. The only way to positively kill the creature is to chop the remnants, set them aflame, and scatter salt over the earth where the ashes lie.</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Habitat/Society:</b> The Spider controls the dank forest known as the Spiderfell, in the midst of the Anuirean powers. It is a testament to the Spider's cunning and subtlety that it has survived this long trapped between so many hostile realms.</p><p>The Spiderfell is one of the most noisome forests in Anuire, and is filled with pitfalls and natural traps. What appear to be game trails lead into bogs and cairns of dead goblins.</p><p>The land is also filled with <i>live</i> goblins and <a href=\"/appendix/gnoll\">gnolls</a>, all scurrying to do the Spider's bidding. Centuries have passed since any of them tried to usurp the Spider's position; tales of that last fool are still told around the campfires at night.</p><p>The spiders that fill the Spiderfell are without number. They range in size from a small fingernail to those that can bring down a deer. Most are highly venomous. None of them attack the Spider's henchmen.</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Ecology:</b> The Spider's armies are feared by kingdoms far and wide, for they raid without provocation and without warning. Regents who have sought to tame the Spiderfell with massive armies have always emerged from the forest with fewer than half their men and a promise never to enter that wood again.</p><p>The Spider commands not only armies of goblins and gnolls, but also has developed a strange control over natural <a href=\"/appendix/spider\">spiders</a>. No one knows the extent of this power, but one unfortunate soul bas claimed to have seen the lesser spiders pumping their venom into their leader. Others claim that the Spider enjoys a telepathic link with each and every one of its arachnid minions.</p><img src=\"/img/spc/thespide.gif\" alt=\"The Spider\" title=\"The Spider\" border=\"0\">\n","images":["<img src=\"grf/br.gif\" width=\"150\" height=\"75\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Birthright\" title=\"Birthright\" align=\"right\">","<img src=\"/img/spc/thespide.gif\" alt=\"The Spider\" title=\"The Spider\" border=\"0\">","<img src=\"grf/tsr_sm.png\" width=\"56\" height=\"59\" border=\"0\" alt=\"TSR\">"],"setting":"Birthright","statblock":{"The Spider":{"Activity Cycle":"Any","Alignment":"Chaotic evil","Armor Class":"-2 for carapace; 4 for underbelly","Blood":"True (Azrai): 95","Blood Abilities":"Animal affinity (spiders-great), Bloodform (great), Invulnerability (great), Long life (great), Major Regeneration (great), Std.
