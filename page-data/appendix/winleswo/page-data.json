While the powers listed above are the most common, some aarakocra have different or additional powers.</p><p class=\"f\">A race of intelligent, birdlike creatures living in the deepest deserts of Athas, the rare Athasian <a href=\"/appendix/aarakocr\">aarakocra</a> spends its time soaring on thermals in search of food.</p><p>The aarakocra is 7 to 8 feet tall with a wingspan of 20 feet or more. Because of its large wingspan, an aarakocra can carry as much as 75% of its own body weight and still fly easily. An aarakocra can fly a short distance carrying a burden equaling 125% of its own body weight. The average body weight of a full grown male is 100 pounds and a female is 85 pounds.</p><p>Each wing has a &ldquo;hand&rdquo; at its midpoint, consisting of three fingers and an opposable thumb. The fourth finger forms the rigid leading edge of the wing. In flight the hands cannot be used, but on the ground the aarakocra can use its hands almost as a human would. The aarakocra's body is protected by a thin bony plate on the chest, much like a solid rib cage. Talons on its legs can be used as claws and can be retracted to reveal a second set of hands, also with three fingers and an opposable thumb. Except for the chest plate, the entire skeleton is hollow and extremely fragile.</p><p>From a distance, the Athasian aarakocra resembles a huge <a href=\"/appendix/bird\">vulture</a>. Its black eyes, set in the front of the head, provide excellent vision over a long range. The plumage is generally black with a white collar for adult males and black or brown with a smaller white collar for females. Adolescents are a mixture of brown and black. The beak is large and covers most of the head. Plumage begins at the crown of the head and is darker near the head, except for the collar. Athasian aarakocra speak their own language and the languages of vultures and other large birds. Some speak the common tongue (5% to 10% chance depending on how deep in the wastelands a tribe lives).</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Combat:</b> Aarakocra can fight in the air or on the ground. They prefer aerial combat since their bones are too fragile to withstand a solid blow from a human-sized opponent. In combat against creatures on the ground, they prefer to fly over their victim and drop weighted nets. Some aarakocra use darts to harass ground-based opponents.</p><p>If their opponents can fly, the aarakocra generally forgo the use of the net, although large groups sometimes use nets on flying creatures. Normally, aarakocra attack flying creatures with long spears, diving from above and allowing the momentum to carry the spear through the target. Such an attack doubles the damage if the aarakocra have been able to dive at least 50 feet. Only the very largest aarakocra can carry more than one of these spears, they can attack with both at once with no penalty, causing double damage on each strike. All diving attacks are made at +4 and should be treated as a charge attack. All other penalties and restrictions of charge attacks apply.</p><p>The effect of the aarakocra's nets depends on if the opponent is flying at the time it becomes entangled. Creatures on the ground that are hit by a net are entangled and unable to participate in any combat until they make a successful Strength check to get free of the net. Flying creatures hit by a net can no longer fly and immediately begin falling. If they cannot escape the net or use some magical means to arrest the fall, normal falling damage applies.</p><p>Unless victims are entangled in nets, aarakocra are cautious in ground combat. If the aarakocra outnumber their opponents they advance in a straight line and thrust with their spears. If outnumbered, or the opponents are particularly tough, the aarakocra withdraw. Victims entangled in nets are killed or incapacitated for use as food or ransom.</p><p>Athasian aarakocra are mindful of their physical limitations as well as their comparatively low psionic abilities. They do not normally initiate psionic combat. At the first sign of psionic powers from any of their victims, however, all aarakocra that have some ability will use whatever attack and defense modes they can in an attempt to destroy the threat. Large groups of is or more aarakocra may initiate psionic combat if their leaders feel they can win quickly and avoid physical combat.</p><p>In desperation, an aarakocra can attempt to bite an opponent in combat. Because of the unwieldiness of its beak, the aarakocra has a THAC0 of 18 if attacking with this appendage. Further, the birdman causes only 1d2 points of damage with the beak.</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Habitat/Society:</b> Athasian aarakocra live in tribes with 6-20 (2d8+4) members, depending on the prestige of the leader. The largest tribe ever recorded had 50 members. The tribal hunting territory depends on the size of the tribe, usually about 500 square miles for a tribe of 10 members. There are no rigid boundaries between tribes and border disputes are not uncommon.</p><p>Alignments of tribe members are similar to the alignment of the leader. A tribe that has a leader who is neutral good may have neutral good, chaotic good, lawful good, and true neutral members. A predominantly evil tribe does not recognize boundaries with other tribes and treats other tribes as inferior beings to be eliminated.</p><p>Athasian aarakocra aren't happy in enclosed spaces, but they they take refuge in a cave or building if necessary.</p><p>Nonevil tribes live in rocky aeries in the highest peaks they can find. Evil tribes are normally nomadic and use an aerie made by another tribe if they need to remain in an area for a long time, even if they have to evict the tribe that made the nest.</p><p>Aarakocra aren't friendly toward intruders in their territory, especially caravans. They try to extract a toll from the caravan for passage through the desert. Good-aligned tribes allow unhindered passage of caravans that pay a tribute. If someone refuses to pay the tribute, the aarakocra try to capture scouts or outriders from the party and hold them until an even larger tribute is paid. The payment may be either livestock or shiny objects. Aarakocra are smart enough not to be taken in by glass baubles instead of gems, although they cannot tell the difference between the more common gems and the rare ones.</p><p>Evil tribes ask for tribute and often attack a caravan whether it pays or not. Aarakocra always demand shiny objects such as stones. These tribes find humans and demihumans to be quite tasty and prefer them to other food.</p><p>Good-aligned tribes of aarakocra sometimes return a lost traveler to the edge of the desert after first removing any valuables the traveler may be carrying. On very rare occasions a tribe might return a lost group of travelers to the more frequently traveled parts of the desert, again after first taking any valuables as payment.</p><p>The oldest male is the leader of the tribal hunting party and has 4+4 Hit Dice. The oldest female is in charge of the tribal aerie and has 3+3 HD. In tribes that have more than 15 members, the next oldest aarakocra serves as shaman and has 3+3 HD; the shaman completes the triumvirate necessary for proper worship and the summoning of elementals. (Interestingly, no magic-using aarakocra has ever been recorded.) Tribes without a shaman cannot summon <a href=\"/appendix/element1\">air elementals</a>, which is an important part of aarakocra culture.</p><p>The shaman is the leader of the daily sun worship. Aarakocra worship the sun because it provides them with the thermals they need to soar in search of food. The shaman also leads the mystic rituals used to summon an air elemental. Summoning an air elemental is usually done only in preparation for the tribe's most sacred ceremony, the hunt. Small tribes must band together for this ceremony to allow the triumvirate to be formed.</p><p>The ceremony to summon an air elemental must be conducted at dawn and requires the oldest male and female to emit a highpitched keening whistle. The shaman conducts an intricate dance around them, simultaneously chanting an ancient summoning mantra.</p><p>The hunt is the final part of the initiation of adolescent aarakocra to adulthood and often takes the tribe far from their normal teritory. The target is always a <a href=\"/appendix/drakalsi\">silt drake</a>. The hunt is the only time the females leave the relative safety of the nest. Even an evil tribe will not interfere with a tribe on a hunt. An air elemental is often summoned to help find the drake, but never takes part in the actual combat. Although the adult members of the tribe take part in the initial phases of the combat, it is the initiates who deliver the final, killing blows to me drake. Scars from the hunt are considered a mark of pride among all aarakocra.</p><p>The females spend about eight months of the year incubating their eggs. Athasian aarakocra mate for life and a pair normally produces as many as 10 offspring. A female lays one egg a year. Constant incubation is not required because of the high daytime temperatures, so the females can maintain the nest and keep the tribe's treasure in order.</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Ecology:</b> Athasian aarakocra are high on the food chain and have no natural enemies other than <a href=\"/appendix/drakatha\">drakes</a>. Unless evil, aarakocra leave their own territory only to hunt the silt drake and return as soon as possible when the hunt is over. (Evil aarakocra attack others, as noted above.) Aarakocra eggs and hatchlings are sought after by wealthy land owners who wish to use the creatures as scouts and sentries. An egg can bring as much as 10 cp in Tyr's marketplace. Tribes that have had eggs or hatchlings stolen have long memories and sometimes take revenge against the thief at a later date. Captive aarakocra join any tribe they come in contact with.</p><p>Athasian aarakocra have a natural life span of 21-30 years.</p><p></p><br clear=\"all\" style=\"clear:both; height:0;\">\r\n","images":["<img src=\"grf/ds.gif\" width=\"150\" height=\"75\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Dark Sun\" title=\"Dark Sun\" align=\"right\">","<img src=\"img/aarakath.gif\" alt=\"Aarakocra (Athas)\" title=\"Aarakocra (Athas)\" border=\"0\" width=\"300\" height=\"360\" style=\"text-align:right;\" align=\"right\">","<img src=\"grf/add2_01.gif\" width=\"200\" height=\"56\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Advanced Dungeons & Dragons 2nd Edition\">"],"setting":"Dark Sun","statblock":{"Aarakocra (Athas)":{"Activity Cycle":"Day","Alignment":"Any","Armor Class":"7","Climate/Terrain":"Deep desert","Damage/Attack":"1d3/1d3 or by weapon","Diet":"Carnivore","Frequency":"Rare","Hit Dice":"2+2","Intelligence":"Average (8-10)","Magic Resistance":"Nil","Morale":"Steady (11)","Movement":"6, Fl 36 (C)","No. Appearing":"1d10","No. of Attacks":"2","Organization":"Tribal","Size":"M (20'+ wingspan)","Special Attacks":"Nil","Special Defenses":"Nil","THAC0":"17","Treasure":"Varies","XP Value":"65"}},"title":"Aarakocra (Athas)"},"sources":["2433"],"statblock_names":[],"title":"Aarakocra (Athas)","prev_key":"zygraat","next_key":"aarakocr","monster_path":"/appendix/aarakath"}}},"pageContext":{"monster_key":"winleswo","monster_data":{"TSR":["1083","11430"],"fullBody":"  <table cellspacing=\"0\" cellpadding=\"0\"><tr class=\"bk\"><th> </th><th class=\"cn\">True</th><th class=\"cn\">Transformed</th></tr><tr><th>Climate/Terrain:</th><td>Any except arctic</td><td>Any</td></tr><tr><th>Frequency:</th><td>Very rare</td><td>Rare</td></tr><tr><th>Organization:</th><td>Solitary or mated pair</td><td>Solitary</td></tr><tr><th>Activity Cycle:</th><td>Any</td><td>Any</td></tr><tr><th>Diet:</th><td>Omnivore</td><td>Omnivore</td></tr><tr><th>Intelligence:</th><td>Low (5-7)</td><td>As previously possessed</td></tr><tr><th>Treasure:</th><td>Q&times;4</td><td>Any (likely Nil)</td></tr><tr><th>Alignment:</th><td>Chaotic neutral</td><td>As previously possessed</td></tr><tr><th>No. Appearing:</th><td>1-2</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><th>Armor Class:</th><td>8</td><td>8</td></tr><tr><th>Movement:</th><td>6, Sw 4</td><td>6, Sw 4</td></tr><tr><th>Hit Dice:</th><td>2+2</td><td>As previously possessed</td></tr><tr><th>THAC0:</th><td>19</td><td>17</td></tr><tr><th>No. of Attacks:</th><td>10</td><td>10</td></tr><tr><th>Damage/Attack:</th><td>2-8/1 &times;9</td><td>2-8/1 &times;9</td></tr><tr><th>Special Attacks:</th><td>Psionic blast, wild magic</td><td>See below</td></tr><tr><th>Special Defenses:</th><td>Anti-Magic Shell</td><td>Nil</td></tr><tr><th>Magic Resistance:</th><td>90%</td><td>90%</td></tr><tr><th>Size:</th><td>S (4' tall)</td><td>S (4' tall)</td></tr><tr><th>Morale:</th><td>Fearless (19)</td><td>As previously possessed</td></tr><tr><th>XP Value:</th><td>975</td><td>Varies</td></tr></table><p class=\"f\">The alkada, or &ldquo;wingless wonder&rdquo;, is a comical beast that resembles a walking egg (which it has also been called). It stands rather unsteadily on two weak legs that end in rubbery, sticky pads, and has two small arms, which it flaps constantly; hence its most popular name. The only sound it can make is a high-pitched chittering.</p><p>Wonders are blue-green in color, with purplish undersides. They redden slightly when angry or excited. A wonder's mouth is atop its head, surrounded by nine tentacles (old tales and records suggest that there was once a related species that had twelve tentacles - and additional powers not possessed by wonders today).</p><p>These pitifully clumsy, waddling misfits of nature are often more deadly than they appear. Many of them are in reality far more powerful, transformed creatures - such as high-level wizards.</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Combat:</b> Wingless wonders are curious, shortsighted (10' or so effective vision and infravision), and seemingly fearless. They wander through life feeling along everything they come into contact with, employing their mouth-fringe of nine rubbery, retractile tentacles.</p><p>A wonder's tentacles are 2 to 12 feet in length, extending or shortening as it desires, and serve to handle food and to aid the wonder in moving about. Their ends are rubbery and sticky, able to grasp and hold anything they touch (a Strength of 13 or greater can break a wonder's grip, as can alcohol and <i>oil of slipperiness</i>). Curiously, wonders cannot be held by any sort of webs, or by <i>sovereign glue</i> or <i>viscid globs</i> (produced by the wand of the same name, detailed in FOR2/<i>The Drow of the Underdark</i>), although spells such as <i>entangle</i> do affect them.</p><p>A wonder can extrude a bony hook from deep within each tentacle, to grasp struggling food or to slash when fighting off a foe. This does 1 hp of damage. In any round of combat, every tentacle can strike at a foe (or multiple foes, if the wonder is surrounded), twice. The first attack does damage (1 hp per successfullystriking tentacle). The second attack is an attempt to grasp the foe: roll d20 for the target, and d10 for the wonder, adding to the wonder's total the number of tentacles it's using (tentacles engaged against another foe, or holding items, cannot participate). If the target's total is higher, the target tears free of the tentacles; if the wonder's adjusted total is higher, the target is dragged within reach of the wonder's mouth, and automatically bitten (for 2d4 damage). The wonder always releases a target after one bite.</p><p>Foes attempting to sever a wonder's tentacles will find that they have an effective Armor Class of 3 (able to suddenly retract from harm), and one can only be severed if it is dealt 7 hp of damage or more in a single round (total hp damage to tentacles does not matter, except to kill the wonder by damage accumulation).</p><p>Wingless wonders radiate a continuous, natural <i>anti-magic shell</i>, that stops all magical attacks inches from their skins. This aura is visible as a faint purple-white <i>faerie fire</i> glow around any wonder that is carrying an egg (developing young inside itself).</p><p>This is doubly curious, as wonders seem to be creatures possessing natural &ldquo;wild&rdquo; magic. Once per day, a wonder can unleash a random minor magical effect - akin to the powers unleashed by a <i>wand of wonder</i>. Such an effect will be at the time of a wonder's choosing, but it can't control just what will occur. The magical effect seems to draw power from the <i>anti-magic shell</i>, which flickers and pulses visibly. The round in which the wild magic effect manifests is the only time spells can penetrate the shell, to affect the wonder itself, although foes of a wonder will have to discover this for themselves.</p><p>Wonders regenerate naturally, regaining 1 lost hit point every 2 rounds. This healing power does not seem to extend to the delicate, fuzz-covered outer skin of an alkada: it does not heal quickly, and many wonders are bleeding copiously when found, leaving a bloody trail wherever they go. Wonders are immune to damage from all forms and sources of fire.</p><p>Wingless wonders also exhibit a permanent, seemingly-unbreakable mind bar. This functions as the telepathic devotion (detailed in PHBR5/<i>The Complete Psionics Handbook</i>), but attempts to engage a wonder in psionic combat always fail; the wonder's mind seems to &ldquo;slip&rdquo; away. In similar fashion, magical spells that aim to contact or influence the mind fail when used on a wonder; there is a momentary impression of colorful mental chaos, and then the wonder's mind seems to &ldquo;slip&rdquo; away.</p><p>The only other psionic activity that a wonder ever exhibits occurs if it is slain: a &ldquo;dying scream&rdquo; directed at its killers. This is similar to the mental blast of a <a href=\"/appendix/mindflay\">mind flayer</a>: it manifests as a cone, aimed by the dying wonder, 60 feet long, 5 feet wide at the base, and 20 feet wide at its end. All creatures in the area of effect must save versus wands at -4 or be <i>confused</i> (as in the wizard spell <i>confusion</i>) for 1d10+2 rounds. They must also save vs. breath weapon or be <i>feebleminded</i> (as the wizard spell). A creature who fails both saves is not mentally affected at all, but is &ldquo;mind-burnt&rdquo; for a physical loss of 2d12 hp.</p><p>Wonders cannot be stunned or subdued by magical or physical means, and seem mentally unaffected by disasters or great violence occurring around them, chittering and waddling unconcernedly in the midst of a battlefield, or trotting in the heart of an attacking <a href=\"/appendix/dragon\">dragon's</a> breath weapon!</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Habitat/Society:</b> Despite its seeming host of immunities and special powers, a wonder is easily killed by purely physical means, and wonders are therefore rare in populated areas.</p><p>Wonders are always curious, and are attracted to brilliant red or purple colors and flashy objects. They are fascinated by gems; any treasure a wonder carries are gems it has swallowed. These stomach-stones are typically a wide variety of pretty stones, some nearly valueless. Wonders seem to spend most of their time curiously examining things around them, and sampling them to see if they can be eaten.</p><p>Wonders are bisexual. Whenever solitary wonders encounter another of their species, the two entwine tentacles and chitter excitedly in chorus for 2 rounds. This appears to be mating contact. Wonders may wander together in mated pairs, but are usually solitary.</p><p>Wonders develop eggs within their bodies, excreting them when they are ready to hatch (gestation seems to take 6 or 7 months). An egg falls to the ground as its parent wonder wanders away, ignoring it, and splits open in 1d4 rounds, to reveal a small and even more clumsy (but otherwise fully-developed, having 1+1 HD but all the other statistics of an adult) wonder.</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Ecology:</b> Wonders eat mainly fruits and vegetables, although they will devour worms, birds, small animals that stray into the reach of their tentacles, and carrion.</p><p>The flesh of a wonder is poisonous (save vs. poison at -1, or take 3d10 points of damage, within 1d4 rounds; if the save is successful, only 1d4 points of damage are suffered, accompanied by a brief, wrenching nausea). Wonders lose their anti-magical properties immediately upon death - and if part of a wonder is cut away from its living body, that part retains no special powers or properties. A Wonder.s skin rots away in 3+1d4 days, but while still intact, it can serve as a cloak protecting (half to no damage, if saving throw successful) against non-magical fire.</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Transformed Wonders</b></p>  <p class=\"ni\">There is a 20% chance that any wingless wonder encountered will not be a &ldquo;natural&rdquo; wonder at all, but a transformed being. Most transformed beings are human mages. Those who encounter a wonder never know if it is merely a curious beast, a helpless victim able to unleash only random small magics, or a disguised magic user, able to cast powerful memorized spells!</p><p>Many wizards from Netheril escaped into wonder form when their kingdom fell, using a spell later (and independently) duplicated by <a href=\"/appendix/elfdrow\">drow</a> mages; the <i>wonderform</i> spell included in TSR 1083 <i>Menzuberranzan</i>. Such transformed folk can speak normally, and work magic, while in wonder-shape, and escape from wonderform at will. As the being's mind is completely shielded from contact, and the wonderform spell masks its true alignment aura with a &ldquo;normal&rdquo; wonder's alignment, this can be a very effective hiding-place from a foe who is able to probe disguises readily.</p><p>Others are not so lucky - and they are the sort most known to surface-world humans, through tales and ballads. Several centuries ago, the notorious &ldquo;spellslinger&rdquo; Durshult the Mage (who made a career of challenging mages, defeating them in spell-combat, and then seizing all their magic) was turned into a wingless wonder by the sorceress Haleera Shundyl, after losing a sorcerous duel to her in Baldur's Gate. After Durshult's fate became widely known, it was for a time a fad to imprison enemies in wingless wonder form.</p><p>The infamous &ldquo;Rebel Mage&rdquo; Phaerl Godeep, a drow male who rebelled against the dictates of the ruling priestesses in his city, was forcibly imprisoned in wonder form - and presumably is still a helpless, ridiculed prisoner. The drow wizard known only as &ldquo;the <a href=\"/appendix/watcspid\">Watchspider</a> Wizard&rdquo; is known to have taken refuge in wonder form to elude a <a href=\"/appendix/tanaleyo\">yochlol</a> summoned and sent (by an angered priestess) to slay him. Several human mages, including Auziiyra Twelvestars of Tethyr and Brondeth of the Broken Staff, may still survive somewhere in the Underdark, in the wonder forms they assumed to escape death at the hands of drow attackers who overwhelmed the human mining community they were guarding.</p><p>In Menzoberranzan, the drow wizards Thaerlbone Faen Tlabbar and Master (of the Academy) Daethleness Tuin'Tarl are known to have escaped the justice of Lloth by taking wonder form - and Ardreyth Mizzrym, Matron of her House at the time, received a fatal surprise when she casually lashed a chittering wonder out of her path during a hunt - and it snarled and unleashed a meteor swarm that fried her and most of her family around her. When the drifting smoke thinned, the blackened wonder was seen, by the astonished drow survivors, standing unconcernedly amid the cooked carnage, having survived the full damage of its own spell. It sighed and shuffled slowly away. That transformed wonder is still out there in the Underdark, somewhere; the drow dared not try to stop it going on about its business.</p><p>Surface-world wizards have developed spells that specifically polymorph a foe into wonder-form, and drow priestesses of the Underdark also use a spell to work the same effect, which keeps the wizards alive in case their power is needed later, but as vulnerable, helpless, non-threatening things. Beings so entrapped cannot speak (though they can use sticks to write words or draw symbols) - they can only chitter, as &ldquo;natural&rdquo; wonders do.</p><p>Lacking any means to work spells or effectively communicate with others, such unfortunates are trapped, although they retain their human intelligence and knowledge. Existence as a wonder may drive a human insane. Check at the end of each year; to avoid insanity, a percentile roll score must exceed a total of 50 minus the character's wisdom. A trapped being can always, by force of will, unleash a wonder's natural random magical effect (as noted earlier), but has no control over what effect occurs.</p><p>The only way to free a being trapped in wonder form is during the once-daily round in which they unleash a wild magic effect. During this round, the anti-magic shell becomes visible, and flickers visibly. A <i>dispel magic</i>, <i>remove curse</i>, or properly-worded <i>polymorph other</i> spell cast at the wonder during this round will return the being to its true form - although the being must make a System Shock Survival roll.</p><p></p><br clear=\"all\" style=\"clear:both; height:0;\">\r\n","images":["<img src=\"grf/fr.gif\" width=\"150\" height=\"75\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Forgotten Realms\" title=\"Forgotten Realms\" align=\"right\">","<img src=\"img/winleswo.gif\" alt=\"Wingless Wonder\" title=\"Wingless Wonder\" border=\"0\" width=\"300\" height=\"360\" style=\"text-align:right;\" align=\"right\">","<img src=\"grf/add2_01.gif\" width=\"200\" height=\"56\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Advanced Dungeons & Dragons 2nd Edition\">"],"setting":"Forgotten Realms","statblock":{"Transformed":{"Activity Cycle":"Any","Alignment":"As previously possessed","Armor Class":"8","Climate/Terrain":"Any","Damage/Attack":"2-8/1 &times;9","Diet":"Omnivore","Frequency":"Rare","Hit Dice":"As previously possessed","Intelligence":"As previously possessed","Magic Resistance":"90%","Morale":"As previously possessed","Movement":"6, Sw 4","No. Appearing":"1","No. of Attacks":"10","Organization":"Solitary","Size":"S (4' tall)","Special Attacks":"See below","Special Defenses":"Nil","THAC0":"17","Treasure":"Any (likely Nil)","XP Value":"Varies"},"True":{"Activity Cycle":"Any","Alignment":"Chaotic neutral","Armor Class":"8","Climate/Terrain":"Any except arctic","Damage/Attack":"2-8/1 &times;9","Diet":"Omnivore","Frequency":"Very rare","Hit Dice":"2+2","Intelligence":"Low (5-7)","Magic Resistance":"90%","Morale":"Fearless (19)","Movement":"6, Sw 4","No. Appearing":"1-2","No. of Attacks":"10","Organization":"Solitary or mated pair","Size":"S (4' tall)","Special Attacks":"Psionic blast, wild magic","Special Defenses":"Anti-Magic Shell","THAC0":"19","Treasure":"Q&times;4","XP Value":"975"}},"title":"Wingless Wonder"},"sources":["1083","11430"],"statblock_names":[],"title":"Wingless Wonder","prev_key":"windghos","next_key":"wintwigh","monster_path":"/appendix/winleswo"}},"staticQueryHashes":[],"slicesMap":{}}
