While the powers listed above are the most common, some aarakocra have different or additional powers.</p><p class=\"f\">A race of intelligent, birdlike creatures living in the deepest deserts of Athas, the rare Athasian <a href=\"/appendix/aarakocr\">aarakocra</a> spends its time soaring on thermals in search of food.</p><p>The aarakocra is 7 to 8 feet tall with a wingspan of 20 feet or more. Because of its large wingspan, an aarakocra can carry as much as 75% of its own body weight and still fly easily. An aarakocra can fly a short distance carrying a burden equaling 125% of its own body weight. The average body weight of a full grown male is 100 pounds and a female is 85 pounds.</p><p>Each wing has a &ldquo;hand&rdquo; at its midpoint, consisting of three fingers and an opposable thumb. The fourth finger forms the rigid leading edge of the wing. In flight the hands cannot be used, but on the ground the aarakocra can use its hands almost as a human would. The aarakocra's body is protected by a thin bony plate on the chest, much like a solid rib cage. Talons on its legs can be used as claws and can be retracted to reveal a second set of hands, also with three fingers and an opposable thumb. Except for the chest plate, the entire skeleton is hollow and extremely fragile.</p><p>From a distance, the Athasian aarakocra resembles a huge <a href=\"/appendix/bird\">vulture</a>. Its black eyes, set in the front of the head, provide excellent vision over a long range. The plumage is generally black with a white collar for adult males and black or brown with a smaller white collar for females. Adolescents are a mixture of brown and black. The beak is large and covers most of the head. Plumage begins at the crown of the head and is darker near the head, except for the collar. Athasian aarakocra speak their own language and the languages of vultures and other large birds. Some speak the common tongue (5% to 10% chance depending on how deep in the wastelands a tribe lives).</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Combat:</b> Aarakocra can fight in the air or on the ground. They prefer aerial combat since their bones are too fragile to withstand a solid blow from a human-sized opponent. In combat against creatures on the ground, they prefer to fly over their victim and drop weighted nets. Some aarakocra use darts to harass ground-based opponents.</p><p>If their opponents can fly, the aarakocra generally forgo the use of the net, although large groups sometimes use nets on flying creatures. Normally, aarakocra attack flying creatures with long spears, diving from above and allowing the momentum to carry the spear through the target. Such an attack doubles the damage if the aarakocra have been able to dive at least 50 feet. Only the very largest aarakocra can carry more than one of these spears, they can attack with both at once with no penalty, causing double damage on each strike. All diving attacks are made at +4 and should be treated as a charge attack. All other penalties and restrictions of charge attacks apply.</p><p>The effect of the aarakocra's nets depends on if the opponent is flying at the time it becomes entangled. Creatures on the ground that are hit by a net are entangled and unable to participate in any combat until they make a successful Strength check to get free of the net. Flying creatures hit by a net can no longer fly and immediately begin falling. If they cannot escape the net or use some magical means to arrest the fall, normal falling damage applies.</p><p>Unless victims are entangled in nets, aarakocra are cautious in ground combat. If the aarakocra outnumber their opponents they advance in a straight line and thrust with their spears. If outnumbered, or the opponents are particularly tough, the aarakocra withdraw. Victims entangled in nets are killed or incapacitated for use as food or ransom.</p><p>Athasian aarakocra are mindful of their physical limitations as well as their comparatively low psionic abilities. They do not normally initiate psionic combat. At the first sign of psionic powers from any of their victims, however, all aarakocra that have some ability will use whatever attack and defense modes they can in an attempt to destroy the threat. Large groups of is or more aarakocra may initiate psionic combat if their leaders feel they can win quickly and avoid physical combat.</p><p>In desperation, an aarakocra can attempt to bite an opponent in combat. Because of the unwieldiness of its beak, the aarakocra has a THAC0 of 18 if attacking with this appendage. Further, the birdman causes only 1d2 points of damage with the beak.</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Habitat/Society:</b> Athasian aarakocra live in tribes with 6-20 (2d8+4) members, depending on the prestige of the leader. The largest tribe ever recorded had 50 members. The tribal hunting territory depends on the size of the tribe, usually about 500 square miles for a tribe of 10 members. There are no rigid boundaries between tribes and border disputes are not uncommon.</p><p>Alignments of tribe members are similar to the alignment of the leader. A tribe that has a leader who is neutral good may have neutral good, chaotic good, lawful good, and true neutral members. A predominantly evil tribe does not recognize boundaries with other tribes and treats other tribes as inferior beings to be eliminated.</p><p>Athasian aarakocra aren't happy in enclosed spaces, but they they take refuge in a cave or building if necessary.</p><p>Nonevil tribes live in rocky aeries in the highest peaks they can find. Evil tribes are normally nomadic and use an aerie made by another tribe if they need to remain in an area for a long time, even if they have to evict the tribe that made the nest.</p><p>Aarakocra aren't friendly toward intruders in their territory, especially caravans. They try to extract a toll from the caravan for passage through the desert. Good-aligned tribes allow unhindered passage of caravans that pay a tribute. If someone refuses to pay the tribute, the aarakocra try to capture scouts or outriders from the party and hold them until an even larger tribute is paid. The payment may be either livestock or shiny objects. Aarakocra are smart enough not to be taken in by glass baubles instead of gems, although they cannot tell the difference between the more common gems and the rare ones.</p><p>Evil tribes ask for tribute and often attack a caravan whether it pays or not. Aarakocra always demand shiny objects such as stones. These tribes find humans and demihumans to be quite tasty and prefer them to other food.</p><p>Good-aligned tribes of aarakocra sometimes return a lost traveler to the edge of the desert after first removing any valuables the traveler may be carrying. On very rare occasions a tribe might return a lost group of travelers to the more frequently traveled parts of the desert, again after first taking any valuables as payment.</p><p>The oldest male is the leader of the tribal hunting party and has 4+4 Hit Dice. The oldest female is in charge of the tribal aerie and has 3+3 HD. In tribes that have more than 15 members, the next oldest aarakocra serves as shaman and has 3+3 HD; the shaman completes the triumvirate necessary for proper worship and the summoning of elementals. (Interestingly, no magic-using aarakocra has ever been recorded.) Tribes without a shaman cannot summon <a href=\"/appendix/element1\">air elementals</a>, which is an important part of aarakocra culture.</p><p>The shaman is the leader of the daily sun worship. Aarakocra worship the sun because it provides them with the thermals they need to soar in search of food. The shaman also leads the mystic rituals used to summon an air elemental. Summoning an air elemental is usually done only in preparation for the tribe's most sacred ceremony, the hunt. Small tribes must band together for this ceremony to allow the triumvirate to be formed.</p><p>The ceremony to summon an air elemental must be conducted at dawn and requires the oldest male and female to emit a highpitched keening whistle. The shaman conducts an intricate dance around them, simultaneously chanting an ancient summoning mantra.</p><p>The hunt is the final part of the initiation of adolescent aarakocra to adulthood and often takes the tribe far from their normal teritory. The target is always a <a href=\"/appendix/drakalsi\">silt drake</a>. The hunt is the only time the females leave the relative safety of the nest. Even an evil tribe will not interfere with a tribe on a hunt. An air elemental is often summoned to help find the drake, but never takes part in the actual combat. Although the adult members of the tribe take part in the initial phases of the combat, it is the initiates who deliver the final, killing blows to me drake. Scars from the hunt are considered a mark of pride among all aarakocra.</p><p>The females spend about eight months of the year incubating their eggs. Athasian aarakocra mate for life and a pair normally produces as many as 10 offspring. A female lays one egg a year. Constant incubation is not required because of the high daytime temperatures, so the females can maintain the nest and keep the tribe's treasure in order.</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Ecology:</b> Athasian aarakocra are high on the food chain and have no natural enemies other than <a href=\"/appendix/drakatha\">drakes</a>. Unless evil, aarakocra leave their own territory only to hunt the silt drake and return as soon as possible when the hunt is over. (Evil aarakocra attack others, as noted above.) Aarakocra eggs and hatchlings are sought after by wealthy land owners who wish to use the creatures as scouts and sentries. An egg can bring as much as 10 cp in Tyr's marketplace. Tribes that have had eggs or hatchlings stolen have long memories and sometimes take revenge against the thief at a later date. Captive aarakocra join any tribe they come in contact with.</p><p>Athasian aarakocra have a natural life span of 21-30 years.</p>\n","images":["<img src=\"grf/ds.gif\" width=\"150\" height=\"75\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Dark Sun\" title=\"Dark Sun\" align=\"right\">","<img src=\"img/aarakath.gif\" alt=\"Aarakocra (Athas)\" title=\"Aarakocra (Athas)\" border=\"0\" width=\"300\" height=\"360\" style=\"text-align:right;\" align=\"right\">","<img src=\"grf/add2_01.gif\" width=\"200\" height=\"56\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Advanced Dungeons & Dragons 2nd Edition\">"],"setting":"Dark Sun","statblock":{"Aarakocra (Athas)":{"Activity Cycle":"Day","Alignment":"Any","Armor Class":"7","Climate/Terrain":"Deep desert","Damage/Attack":"1d3/1d3 or by weapon","Diet":"Carnivore","Frequency":"Rare","Hit Dice":"2+2","Intelligence":"Average (8-10)","Magic Resistance":"Nil","Morale":"Steady (11)","Movement":"6, Fl 36 (C)","No. Appearing":"1d10","No. of Attacks":"2","Organization":"Tribal","Size":"M (20'+ wingspan)","Special Attacks":"Nil","Special Defenses":"Nil","THAC0":"17","Treasure":"Varies","XP Value":"65"}},"title":"Aarakocra (Athas)"},"sources":["2433"],"statblock_names":[],"title":"Aarakocra (Athas)","prev_key":"zygraat","next_key":"aarakocr","monster_path":"/appendix/aarakath"}}},"pageContext":{"monster_key":"golervmi","monster_data":{"TSR":["2153"],"fullBody":"  <table cellspacing=\"0\" cellpadding=\"0\"><tr><th>Climate/Terrain:</th><td>Ravenloft</td></tr><tr><th>Frequency:</th><td>Very rare</td></tr><tr><th>Organization:</th><td>Solitary</td></tr><tr><th>Activity Cycle:</th><td>Any</td></tr><tr><th>Diet:</th><td>None</td></tr><tr><th>Intelligence:</th><td>Low (5-7)</td></tr><tr><th>Treasure:</th><td>Nil</td></tr><tr><th>Alignment:</th><td>Chaotic evil</td></tr><tr><th>No. Appearing:</th><td>1</td></tr><tr><th>Armor Class:</th><td>-2</td></tr><tr><th>Movement:</th><td>9</td></tr><tr><th>Hit Dice:</th><td>18 (90 hp)</td></tr><tr><th>THAC0:</th><td>3</td></tr><tr><th>No. of Attacks:</th><td>2</td></tr><tr><th>Damage/Attack:</th><td>3d6/3d6</td></tr><tr><th>Special Attacks:</th><td>See below</td></tr><tr><th>Special Defenses:</th><td>See below</td></tr><tr><th>Magic Resistance:</th><td>25%</td></tr><tr><th>Size:</th><td>L (12' tall)</td></tr><tr><th>Morale:</th><td>Fearless (19-20)</td></tr><tr><th>XP Value:</th><td>14,000</td></tr></table><p class=\"f\">Mist <a href=\"/appendix/golem\">golems</a> are creatures of fate, brought into being accidentally by misguided wizards and priests who do not fully understand what they are doing. No one sets out to build a mist <a href=\"/appendix/golerv\">golem</a>, but in a fool's rush to complete the building of some other automaton, tragic circumstance often takes a hand, and even the most dedicated of labors goes astray.</p><p>Mist golems look very much like swirling wisps of vapor and billowing clouds of steam mystically constrained in the shape of a 12-foot-tall man or woman. They often resemble the man or woman responsible for creating them. When moving through areas of fog. they are all but invisible, although they may be plainly seen whenever they wish to be.</p><p>Mist golems do not speak, but can create a mournful howl that can be heard as far away as a mile.</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Combat:</b> When in an area of mist or fog, these creatures often surprise their enemies. Anyone attacked by a mist golem in such a place suffers a -2 penalty on his surprise roll.</p><p>As mentioned above, mist golems are able to attack with their mournful howling. Indeed. the hearing of this sound is often the first warning that a group of adventurers will have that they are in the presence of such a creature. So dreadful is this keening that all those within 50 feet of the creature must make a fear check upon hearing it.</p><p>The mist golem may strike once per round with each of its two fists, doing 3d6 points of damage on any successful hit. So powerful are these blows that they function as battering rams when the creature employs them against structures (consult the demolition rules in the <i>Dungeon Master Guide</i>).</p><p>On any natural Attack Roll of 20, the target of the golem's attack is infused with the creature's ethereal essence. If the damage generated by this attack is sufficient to kill the target, his body instantly dissolves away into mist and seemingly dissipates into nothing. In truth, the character has been transformed in a wandering <a href=\"/appendix/misthorr\">mist horror</a>. No attempt to restore life to the character will succeed unless his new form is sought out and captured somehow.</p><p>If the damage generated in the attack does not kill the target, a lesser transformation takes place. For the next ten rounds, the person infused with the golem's power becomes an ethereal being of mist and fog. Looking like a faintly projected image, the victim is unable to take any action. Wounds inflicted upon the golem while one or more transformed creatures exist do not affect the automaton. Instead, the infused being suffers them, a fact obvious to all who can see the incorporeal character. Attacks directed at the ethereal character will not harm him unless a +2 or better weapon is used. A character who dies while infused with the power of the mist golem becomes a mist horror as detailed above.</p><p>Whenever it wishes to do so, a mist golem may envelop itself in a shroud of vapor that fills an area some 15' about the creature. The cloud is magical in nature and can have one of ten different magical effects. Each effect can be manifested only once per day, so that the cloud could be created only ten times in any given day, each time with a different mystical property. If the golem is surprised, it instinctively releases this cloud, with the DM rolling 1d10 to see which effect it has. No matter which of the cloud's effects is chosen, characters caught in the mist are entitled to any saving throws and the like that they would normally receive. However, a -4 penalty is applied to all such checks because of the golem's great power.</p><table class=\"ip\"><tr class=\"bk\"><th>Roll</th><th>Effect</th></tr><tr><td>1</td><td><i>Cloudkill</i></td></tr><tr><td>2</td><td><i>Irritation</i></td></tr><tr><td>3</td><td><i>Blindness</i></td></tr><tr><td>4</td><td><i>Hold Person</i></td></tr><tr><td>5</td><td><i>Tasha's Uncontrollable Hideous Laughter</i></td></tr><tr><td>6</td><td><i>Otto's irresistible Dance</i></td></tr><tr><td>7</td><td><i>Stinking Cloud</i></td></tr><tr><td>8</td><td><i>Silence, 15' Radius</i></td></tr><tr><td>9</td><td><i>Vampiric Touch</i></td></tr><tr><td>10</td><td><i>Slow</i></td></tr></table><p>Regardless of past exposure to this cloud, a character must make a new check each and every time he is exposed to these magical vapors.</p><p>Because of the vaporous nature of the mist golem's body it is seldom hampered by physical objects. While it cannot fly per se, it can drift through even the smallest of apertures. Traps that are triggered by things like trip wires or pressure plates fail to go off when the virtually weightless mist drifts over them.</p><p>Like most of the automatons forged in the fires of Ravenloft, the mist golem cannot be harmed by any weapon of less than +2 enchantment. All other physical attacks directed at the creature pass through it without harm, although they do cause a slight rippling in the swirls of fog that make up its body.</p><p>Magic is all but useless against these creatures. They are immune to all manner of mind- or life-affecting spells and attempts to disrupt them with spells like <i>gust of wind</i> will have no effect upon them. On a similar note, magical and natural forces in and around the creature, like fire, cold. and so forth, do not harm it in any way. The casting of a <i>dispel magic</i>, which is so deadly to all other magical automata, has no effect upon a mist golem.</p><p>Magical attacks employed directly against the golem, like a <i>lightning bolt</i> or <i>magic missile</i> spell, do not harm the automaton. Indeed, if the creature has recently been injured it will employ the power of these magics to regenerate lost hit points at a rate of 1 for every 2 points of damage that the attack would normally have done to it. Thus, a 14-point fireball would supply the golem with enough energy to heal 7 points of damage.</p><p>When it is hard pressed by an enemy, a mist golem can escape into the vaporous fabric of Ravenloft. In order to do so, the creature must take no other action for one found. During this time, all attacks against the golem are made with a +2 bonus. On the next round, the creature appears to ripple away into nothingness, leaving no indication that it had ever been present save for a dense bank of fog that thins out gradually over the course of the next hour.</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Habitat/Society:</b> Mist golems are not social creatures. At best, only a handful of them have ever been created, and most of these wander to endless expanses of Ravenloft's vaporous clouds, avoiding all contact with the living. For the most part. they are encountered only when someone foolish seeks them out or attempts to control them. On rare occasions, however, they wander into a domain or one of the demiplane's islands, leaving a trail of destruction behind them until they are again consumed by the mists and vanish.</p><p>Like the <a href=\"/appendix/humavist\">Vistani</a>, mist golems are able to navigate the mists of Ravenloft without effort. Whenever a golem uses its ability to escape into the mists, it can reappear anywhere else in Ravenloft after walking only a short distance. No matter how far the creature wishes to travel, its journey is always one of 99 steps. As soon as it takes the last of these steps, it materializes again in the real world. If the creature has no destination in mind, it need not leave the mists. If it wished to, the golem could wander forever among the swirling clouds of mist that make up this ethereal domain of the mist horrors.</p><p>The creation of any mist golem, accidental though it might be, also results in the manifestation of an unusual focus. No two of these objects are alike, yet all function in the same way. At the time of the monster's animation, when the physical body that was to have housed it fades away, some nearby object acts as a lens through which the animating power of the mists is concentrated, focused, and transferred upon the creature.</p><p>While it is impossible to say what object will be given this mantle of mystical energy, there are a few things that all known foci have had in common. First, a focus will always be within 50' of both the golem and its creator at the time of the transformation. Second. it will always be of great value (generally not less than 10,000 gold pieces). Third, foci are never very large, weighing at most 5 pounds and generally seldom more than half that. Lastly, the item must be bathed in direct moonlight at the time of the transmutation. As one might gather from the last point, mist golems are always created in the dead of a cloudless night.</p><p>From the moment of its creation, this focus is the bane of the golem's existence. Whoever holds the focus in his hand can command the golem to do for him no fewer than five tasks. So long as the golem's master keeps the focus on his person (either in hand, worn as an amulet, or so forth), the golem can do him no harm and must obey his instructions to the letter. As is often the case, of course, the intent of the orders or their ramifications may be perverted dangerously. As a rule, the first order is carried out exactly as its master wishes, with each additional one being more and more twisted. With the completion of the fifth task, the focus is consumed by the mists, vanishing to reappear somewhere else in Ravenloft. For its part, the golem becomes obsessed with the destruction of its former master.</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Ecology:</b> Unlike other golems, these mysterious creatures are not intentionally created. The first of them (and presumably all others since then) was manifested when an ancient sage attempted to animate a more traditional golem by tapping directly into the mists of Ravenloft. Aware that the land was held together by some mysterious power, but unable to fathom its true nature, the golem's architect fathered a creature more powerful and deadly than anything he could have imagined.</p><p>Invariably, the mist golem hungers for destruction and death. First it longs to see the one who sought to control it torn apart and then it begins an endless rampage in which any who encounter the ethereal creature become fair game. From time to time, it must obey a master who holds the focus that empowers it, but these occasions are fleeting and always end with the death of its would-be sovereign.</p>\n","images":["<img src=\"grf/rv.gif\" width=\"150\" height=\"75\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Ravenloft\" title=\"Ravenloft\" align=\"right\">","<img src=\"img/golervmi.gif\" alt=\"Golem, Mist (Ravenloft)\" title=\"Golem, Mist (Ravenloft)\" border=\"0\" width=\"300\" height=\"360\" style=\"text-align:right;\" align=\"right\">","<img src=\"grf/add2_01.gif\" width=\"200\" height=\"56\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Advanced Dungeons & Dragons 2nd Edition\">"],"setting":"Ravenloft","statblock":{"Golem, Mist (Ravenloft)":{"Activity Cycle":"Any","Alignment":"Chaotic evil","Armor Class":"-2","Climate/Terrain":"Ravenloft","Damage/Attack":"3d6/3d6","Diet":"None","Frequency":"Very rare","Hit Dice":"18 (90 hp)","Intelligence":"Low (5-7)","Magic Resistance":"25%","Morale":"Fearless (19-20)","Movement":"9","No. Appearing":"1","No. of Attacks":"2","Organization":"Solitary","Size":"L (12' tall)","Special Attacks":"See below","Special Defenses":"See below","THAC0":"3","Treasure":"Nil","XP Value":"14,000"}},"title":"Golem, Mist (Ravenloft)"},"sources":["2153"],"statblock_names":[],"title":"Golem, Mist (Ravenloft)","prev_key":"golervfl","next_key":"golervmz","monster_path":"/appendix/golervmi"}},"staticQueryHashes":[],"slicesMap":{}}
