While the powers listed above are the most common, some aarakocra have different or additional powers.</p><p class=\"f\">A race of intelligent, birdlike creatures living in the deepest deserts of Athas, the rare Athasian <a href=\"/appendix/aarakocr\">aarakocra</a> spends its time soaring on thermals in search of food.</p><p>The aarakocra is 7 to 8 feet tall with a wingspan of 20 feet or more. Because of its large wingspan, an aarakocra can carry as much as 75% of its own body weight and still fly easily. An aarakocra can fly a short distance carrying a burden equaling 125% of its own body weight. The average body weight of a full grown male is 100 pounds and a female is 85 pounds.</p><p>Each wing has a &ldquo;hand&rdquo; at its midpoint, consisting of three fingers and an opposable thumb. The fourth finger forms the rigid leading edge of the wing. In flight the hands cannot be used, but on the ground the aarakocra can use its hands almost as a human would. The aarakocra's body is protected by a thin bony plate on the chest, much like a solid rib cage. Talons on its legs can be used as claws and can be retracted to reveal a second set of hands, also with three fingers and an opposable thumb. Except for the chest plate, the entire skeleton is hollow and extremely fragile.</p><p>From a distance, the Athasian aarakocra resembles a huge <a href=\"/appendix/bird\">vulture</a>. Its black eyes, set in the front of the head, provide excellent vision over a long range. The plumage is generally black with a white collar for adult males and black or brown with a smaller white collar for females. Adolescents are a mixture of brown and black. The beak is large and covers most of the head. Plumage begins at the crown of the head and is darker near the head, except for the collar. Athasian aarakocra speak their own language and the languages of vultures and other large birds. Some speak the common tongue (5% to 10% chance depending on how deep in the wastelands a tribe lives).</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Combat:</b> Aarakocra can fight in the air or on the ground. They prefer aerial combat since their bones are too fragile to withstand a solid blow from a human-sized opponent. In combat against creatures on the ground, they prefer to fly over their victim and drop weighted nets. Some aarakocra use darts to harass ground-based opponents.</p><p>If their opponents can fly, the aarakocra generally forgo the use of the net, although large groups sometimes use nets on flying creatures. Normally, aarakocra attack flying creatures with long spears, diving from above and allowing the momentum to carry the spear through the target. Such an attack doubles the damage if the aarakocra have been able to dive at least 50 feet. Only the very largest aarakocra can carry more than one of these spears, they can attack with both at once with no penalty, causing double damage on each strike. All diving attacks are made at +4 and should be treated as a charge attack. All other penalties and restrictions of charge attacks apply.</p><p>The effect of the aarakocra's nets depends on if the opponent is flying at the time it becomes entangled. Creatures on the ground that are hit by a net are entangled and unable to participate in any combat until they make a successful Strength check to get free of the net. Flying creatures hit by a net can no longer fly and immediately begin falling. If they cannot escape the net or use some magical means to arrest the fall, normal falling damage applies.</p><p>Unless victims are entangled in nets, aarakocra are cautious in ground combat. If the aarakocra outnumber their opponents they advance in a straight line and thrust with their spears. If outnumbered, or the opponents are particularly tough, the aarakocra withdraw. Victims entangled in nets are killed or incapacitated for use as food or ransom.</p><p>Athasian aarakocra are mindful of their physical limitations as well as their comparatively low psionic abilities. They do not normally initiate psionic combat. At the first sign of psionic powers from any of their victims, however, all aarakocra that have some ability will use whatever attack and defense modes they can in an attempt to destroy the threat. Large groups of is or more aarakocra may initiate psionic combat if their leaders feel they can win quickly and avoid physical combat.</p><p>In desperation, an aarakocra can attempt to bite an opponent in combat. Because of the unwieldiness of its beak, the aarakocra has a THAC0 of 18 if attacking with this appendage. Further, the birdman causes only 1d2 points of damage with the beak.</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Habitat/Society:</b> Athasian aarakocra live in tribes with 6-20 (2d8+4) members, depending on the prestige of the leader. The largest tribe ever recorded had 50 members. The tribal hunting territory depends on the size of the tribe, usually about 500 square miles for a tribe of 10 members. There are no rigid boundaries between tribes and border disputes are not uncommon.</p><p>Alignments of tribe members are similar to the alignment of the leader. A tribe that has a leader who is neutral good may have neutral good, chaotic good, lawful good, and true neutral members. A predominantly evil tribe does not recognize boundaries with other tribes and treats other tribes as inferior beings to be eliminated.</p><p>Athasian aarakocra aren't happy in enclosed spaces, but they they take refuge in a cave or building if necessary.</p><p>Nonevil tribes live in rocky aeries in the highest peaks they can find. Evil tribes are normally nomadic and use an aerie made by another tribe if they need to remain in an area for a long time, even if they have to evict the tribe that made the nest.</p><p>Aarakocra aren't friendly toward intruders in their territory, especially caravans. They try to extract a toll from the caravan for passage through the desert. Good-aligned tribes allow unhindered passage of caravans that pay a tribute. If someone refuses to pay the tribute, the aarakocra try to capture scouts or outriders from the party and hold them until an even larger tribute is paid. The payment may be either livestock or shiny objects. Aarakocra are smart enough not to be taken in by glass baubles instead of gems, although they cannot tell the difference between the more common gems and the rare ones.</p><p>Evil tribes ask for tribute and often attack a caravan whether it pays or not. Aarakocra always demand shiny objects such as stones. These tribes find humans and demihumans to be quite tasty and prefer them to other food.</p><p>Good-aligned tribes of aarakocra sometimes return a lost traveler to the edge of the desert after first removing any valuables the traveler may be carrying. On very rare occasions a tribe might return a lost group of travelers to the more frequently traveled parts of the desert, again after first taking any valuables as payment.</p><p>The oldest male is the leader of the tribal hunting party and has 4+4 Hit Dice. The oldest female is in charge of the tribal aerie and has 3+3 HD. In tribes that have more than 15 members, the next oldest aarakocra serves as shaman and has 3+3 HD; the shaman completes the triumvirate necessary for proper worship and the summoning of elementals. (Interestingly, no magic-using aarakocra has ever been recorded.) Tribes without a shaman cannot summon <a href=\"/appendix/element1\">air elementals</a>, which is an important part of aarakocra culture.</p><p>The shaman is the leader of the daily sun worship. Aarakocra worship the sun because it provides them with the thermals they need to soar in search of food. The shaman also leads the mystic rituals used to summon an air elemental. Summoning an air elemental is usually done only in preparation for the tribe's most sacred ceremony, the hunt. Small tribes must band together for this ceremony to allow the triumvirate to be formed.</p><p>The ceremony to summon an air elemental must be conducted at dawn and requires the oldest male and female to emit a highpitched keening whistle. The shaman conducts an intricate dance around them, simultaneously chanting an ancient summoning mantra.</p><p>The hunt is the final part of the initiation of adolescent aarakocra to adulthood and often takes the tribe far from their normal teritory. The target is always a <a href=\"/appendix/drakalsi\">silt drake</a>. The hunt is the only time the females leave the relative safety of the nest. Even an evil tribe will not interfere with a tribe on a hunt. An air elemental is often summoned to help find the drake, but never takes part in the actual combat. Although the adult members of the tribe take part in the initial phases of the combat, it is the initiates who deliver the final, killing blows to me drake. Scars from the hunt are considered a mark of pride among all aarakocra.</p><p>The females spend about eight months of the year incubating their eggs. Athasian aarakocra mate for life and a pair normally produces as many as 10 offspring. A female lays one egg a year. Constant incubation is not required because of the high daytime temperatures, so the females can maintain the nest and keep the tribe's treasure in order.</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Ecology:</b> Athasian aarakocra are high on the food chain and have no natural enemies other than <a href=\"/appendix/drakatha\">drakes</a>. Unless evil, aarakocra leave their own territory only to hunt the silt drake and return as soon as possible when the hunt is over. (Evil aarakocra attack others, as noted above.) Aarakocra eggs and hatchlings are sought after by wealthy land owners who wish to use the creatures as scouts and sentries. An egg can bring as much as 10 cp in Tyr's marketplace. Tribes that have had eggs or hatchlings stolen have long memories and sometimes take revenge against the thief at a later date. Captive aarakocra join any tribe they come in contact with.</p><p>Athasian aarakocra have a natural life span of 21-30 years.</p>\n","images":["<img src=\"grf/ds.gif\" width=\"150\" height=\"75\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Dark Sun\" title=\"Dark Sun\" align=\"right\">","<img src=\"img/aarakath.gif\" alt=\"Aarakocra (Athas)\" title=\"Aarakocra (Athas)\" border=\"0\" width=\"300\" height=\"360\" style=\"text-align:right;\" align=\"right\">","<img src=\"grf/add2_01.gif\" width=\"200\" height=\"56\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Advanced Dungeons & Dragons 2nd Edition\">"],"setting":"Dark Sun","statblock":{"Aarakocra (Athas)":{"Activity Cycle":"Day","Alignment":"Any","Armor Class":"7","Climate/Terrain":"Deep desert","Damage/Attack":"1d3/1d3 or by weapon","Diet":"Carnivore","Frequency":"Rare","Hit Dice":"2+2","Intelligence":"Average (8-10)","Magic Resistance":"Nil","Morale":"Steady (11)","Movement":"6, Fl 36 (C)","No. Appearing":"1d10","No. of Attacks":"2","Organization":"Tribal","Size":"M (20'+ wingspan)","Special Attacks":"Nil","Special Defenses":"Nil","THAC0":"17","Treasure":"Varies","XP Value":"65"}},"title":"Aarakocra (Athas)"},"sources":["2433"],"statblock_names":[],"title":"Aarakocra (Athas)","prev_key":"zygraat","next_key":"aarakocr","monster_path":"/appendix/aarakath"}}},"pageContext":{"monster_key":"shadecer","monster_data":{"TSR":["3140"],"fullBody":"  <table cellspacing=\"0\" cellpadding=\"0\"><tr><th>Climate/Terrain:</th><td>Shadow World, Cerilia</td></tr><tr><th>Frequency:</th><td>Very rare</td></tr><tr><th>Organization:</th><td>Solitary</td></tr><tr><th>Activity Cycle:</th><td>Any (SW); Twilight/night (Cerlia)</td></tr><tr><th>Diet:</th><td>Omnivore</td></tr><tr><th>Intelligence:</th><td>Low to genius (5-18)</td></tr><tr><th>Treasure:</th><td>K,M,N, or W</td></tr><tr><th>Alignment:</th><td>Any nongood</td></tr><tr><th>No. Appearing:</th><td>1-2</td></tr><tr><th>Armor Class:</th><td>10 (or by armor type)</td></tr><tr><th>Movement:</th><td>15</td></tr><tr><th>Hit Dice:</th><td>10</td></tr><tr><th>THAC0:</th><td>11</td></tr><tr><th>No. of Attacks:</th><td>1 (or by class &amp; level)</td></tr><tr><th>Damage/Attack:</th><td>By weapon (usually 1d8)</td></tr><tr><th>Special Attacks:</th><td>Seeming, surprise</td></tr><tr><th>Special Defenses:</th><td>Seeming, <i>blink</i>, regeneration</td></tr><tr><th>Magic Resistance:</th><td>Variable</td></tr><tr><th>Size:</th><td>M (usually about 6' tall)</td></tr><tr><th>Morale:</th><td>Elite (13-14)</td></tr><tr><th>XP Value:</th><td>6,000</td></tr></table><blockquote>There’s a creature said to walk among us— \"shades,\" they call them. The beings look like humans, talk like humans, walk like humans. But inside, there’s nothing human about them.</blockquote><p>—Halden, Faylene’s grandson, 1467 HC</p><p class=\"f\">Shades are former humans transformed into creatures of shadow. They move freely through both the Shadow World and Cerilia, doing the bidding of their evil masters.</p><p>Shades bear such a strong resemblance to humans that the creatures are often mistaken for them. Most shades appear as humans of their former physical height and appearance, but with grayish or nearly black dusky skin and veiled eyes. They favor somber clothing and wear armor if they so desire, provided it does not interfere with any spellcasting abilities they may possess. Shades can speak as many languages as their intelligence allows, but have no special language of their own. All shades speak their native human tongue.</p><p>Created by evil wizards, shades exist to serve their masters as slaves. Though any evil mage with enough experience and resources can transform someone into a shade, few meet these qualifications. Most of those who do dwell in the Shadow World. Shades are favorite minions among the land’s powerful denizens</p><p>Should player characters encounter a high-level evil wizard, they could wind up in danger of becoming shades themselves.</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Combat:</b> Shades, by their nature, have an affinity for shadow, and behave differently depending on the degree of shadow they occupy.</p><p>Shades become fairly weak when exposed to unrelieved light or complete darkness, but prove formidable when in shadows. Their varying capabilities are described below, and also listed in the Shade Ability Summary Table for ease of reference.</p><p><b>No Shadows (Cerilia):</b> The shade is surrounded by multiple light sources: within a magical <i>light</i> or <i>darkness</i> spell, in a room cut off from all light sources (complete darkness), or in the open on a bright, clear day. The shade suffers these penalties:</p><ul><li>All the shade's senses function at half the human norm.</li><li>Base movement rate reduced to 12.</li><li>-2 hit points per hit die (minimum 1 point per die).</li><li>-4 saving throw penalty.</li></ul><p><b>Weak Shadows (Cerilia):</b> These lighting conditions include outdoors at dawn or twilight, in the woods on a bright day, in average indoor light, or outdoors on a moonless or overcast night. The shade functions normally in most respects, enjoying acute eyesight and hearing. The shade inflicts a -1 penalty on an opponents's surprise rolls.</p><p><b>Strong Shadows (Cerilia):</b> The shade enjoys the following advantages outdoors at night or in dim indoor light:</p><ul><li>Highly acute eyesight and hearing equal to twice the human norm.</li><li>+1 hit point per hit die.</li><li>+2 to surprise rolls, -2 to opponent's surprise rolls.</li><li>Base movement rate of 15.</li><li>+1 to all saving throws, attack rolls, and damage rolls; all such rolls made against the shade suffer a -1 penalty (minimum 1 point of damage per die).</li><li>Magic resistance equal to 2% per hit die or level of experience (but never more than 40%).</li><li><i>Invisibility</i> once per turn, maximum duration 1 hour per use.</li><li>The ability to create <i>shadow images</i> once an hour. This ability is similar to a <i>mirror image</i> spell cast at the shade's level (or 2nd level, whichever is better), except that 1d4+3 images appear.</li><li>The ability to regenerate 1 hit point a turn. The shade can regenerate severed limbs if the lost limb is pressed against the stump, but cannot regenerate its head if decapitated.</li></ul><p><b>Shadow World:</b> As the Shadow World is a shade’s home terrain, its abilities are strongest there. While in the Shadow World, a shade enjoys:</p><ul><li>Highly acute eyesight and hearing equal to twice the human norm. The shade sees through shadows as well as a human sees in broad daylight. Any hide in shadows attempts (except by other shades) automatically fail with respect to the shade.</li><li>+3 hit points per hit die.</li><li>+3 to surprise rolls, -3 to opponent's surprise rolls.</li><li>Base movement rate of 18 and ability to make a controlled <i>blink</i> once every two rounds. This ability allows the shade to appear in any very shadowy area within 100 yards and attack, use an ability, or cast a spell after it appears. The shade never appears inside a solid object.</li><li>+3 to all saving throws, attack rolls, and damage rolls; all such rolls made against the shade suffer a -3 penalty (minimum 1 point of damage per die).</li><li>Magic resistance equal to 3% per hit die or level of experience (but never more than 70%).</li><li>Middling ability to manipulate the Seeming.</li><li>The ability to create <i>quasi-real images</i> once an hour. This ability is similar to a <i>demishadow monsters</i> spell cast at the shade's level (or 2nd level, whichever is better), except that 1d4 duplicates of the shade appear. The shade has mental control over the duplicates.</li><li>The ability to regenerate 3 hit points a round, with the limitations noted above under the regeneration ability for strong shadows.</li><li>The ability to <i>teleport witout error</i> to any very shadowy locale on the same world as the shade or <i>plane shift</i> to or from the Demiplane of Shadow. The shade can either <i>teleport</i> or <i>plane shift</i> once a day, but not both.</li></ul><p>Noncombative encounters with shades are possible. Characters should find them reluctant to converse (unless a shade is itself digging for information) and unwilling to disclose any details about themselves. ost shades PCs meet have tasks to fulfill for their masters; they have little time to tarry and even less inclination to divulge the details of their nature or activities.</p><p>The longer they have been shades, the more these creatures know about the Shadow World and the more they can penetrate its Seeming. Shades average a lesser perception score, though very new shades have lower scores and old shades have higher scores.</p><p>Shades’ Seeming abilities vary with location and lighting conditions (see “Combat”).</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Habitat/Society:</b> Shades tend toward taciturn dispositions and prefer solitude. They live primarily in the Shadow World. Though some shades still maintain strong connections with their former abodes in Cerilia, most underwent their transformations so long ago that they have almost forgotten their lives as mortals. Such shades find many humans’ urgent concerns trivial. They may even have difficulty concentrating on the conversations of mortals addressing them, having grown used to ignoring people and things that do not interest them.</p><p>Shades spend a great deal of time returning to Cerilia, much more so than many other creatures of the Shadow World. They do so under the direction of their evil masters—many of whom cannot or prefer not to make the crossing themselves. These lords send them on missions to gather information, retrieve powerful items, kidnap or kill important (or seemingly unimportant) beings, protect a certain location, or perform some other task.</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Ecology:</b> Human beings become shades when wizards use powerful magic (see spell description, below) to replace their spirits with the stuff of shadows. Most undergo this transformation involuntarily, though a few people sworn to the cause of evil have been known to submit freely. The process confers upon subjects virtual immortality (shades die only if slain and prevented from regenerating), but leaves them sterile.</p><p>Shades eat much the same diet as they did while mortal, but apparently receive some nourishment from shadow itself; no accounts exist of any of captive shades (for what little time they were captured) starving or becoming malnourished for lack of food and water. Shades do not create an uneasy reaction in animals, as do many unnatural creatures; quite to the contrary, they seem to be ignored by creatures of lesser intelligence, perceived simply as shadows rather than as living beings.</p><p>Demihumans who become shades function as described here, though their appearance suggests their former race. A dwarven shade, for example, might appear very stout. There are very few demihuman shades compared to the number of apparently human shades.</p><table class=\"ip\"><caption>Shade Summary Table</caption><tr class=\"bk\"><th>Lighting Condition</th><th>Senses (re.
