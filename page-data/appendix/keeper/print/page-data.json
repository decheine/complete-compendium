While the powers listed above are the most common, some aarakocra have different or additional powers.</p><p class=\"f\">A race of intelligent, birdlike creatures living in the deepest deserts of Athas, the rare Athasian <a href=\"/appendix/aarakocr\">aarakocra</a> spends its time soaring on thermals in search of food.</p><p>The aarakocra is 7 to 8 feet tall with a wingspan of 20 feet or more. Because of its large wingspan, an aarakocra can carry as much as 75% of its own body weight and still fly easily. An aarakocra can fly a short distance carrying a burden equaling 125% of its own body weight. The average body weight of a full grown male is 100 pounds and a female is 85 pounds.</p><p>Each wing has a &ldquo;hand&rdquo; at its midpoint, consisting of three fingers and an opposable thumb. The fourth finger forms the rigid leading edge of the wing. In flight the hands cannot be used, but on the ground the aarakocra can use its hands almost as a human would. The aarakocra's body is protected by a thin bony plate on the chest, much like a solid rib cage. Talons on its legs can be used as claws and can be retracted to reveal a second set of hands, also with three fingers and an opposable thumb. Except for the chest plate, the entire skeleton is hollow and extremely fragile.</p><p>From a distance, the Athasian aarakocra resembles a huge <a href=\"/appendix/bird\">vulture</a>. Its black eyes, set in the front of the head, provide excellent vision over a long range. The plumage is generally black with a white collar for adult males and black or brown with a smaller white collar for females. Adolescents are a mixture of brown and black. The beak is large and covers most of the head. Plumage begins at the crown of the head and is darker near the head, except for the collar. Athasian aarakocra speak their own language and the languages of vultures and other large birds. Some speak the common tongue (5% to 10% chance depending on how deep in the wastelands a tribe lives).</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Combat:</b> Aarakocra can fight in the air or on the ground. They prefer aerial combat since their bones are too fragile to withstand a solid blow from a human-sized opponent. In combat against creatures on the ground, they prefer to fly over their victim and drop weighted nets. Some aarakocra use darts to harass ground-based opponents.</p><p>If their opponents can fly, the aarakocra generally forgo the use of the net, although large groups sometimes use nets on flying creatures. Normally, aarakocra attack flying creatures with long spears, diving from above and allowing the momentum to carry the spear through the target. Such an attack doubles the damage if the aarakocra have been able to dive at least 50 feet. Only the very largest aarakocra can carry more than one of these spears, they can attack with both at once with no penalty, causing double damage on each strike. All diving attacks are made at +4 and should be treated as a charge attack. All other penalties and restrictions of charge attacks apply.</p><p>The effect of the aarakocra's nets depends on if the opponent is flying at the time it becomes entangled. Creatures on the ground that are hit by a net are entangled and unable to participate in any combat until they make a successful Strength check to get free of the net. Flying creatures hit by a net can no longer fly and immediately begin falling. If they cannot escape the net or use some magical means to arrest the fall, normal falling damage applies.</p><p>Unless victims are entangled in nets, aarakocra are cautious in ground combat. If the aarakocra outnumber their opponents they advance in a straight line and thrust with their spears. If outnumbered, or the opponents are particularly tough, the aarakocra withdraw. Victims entangled in nets are killed or incapacitated for use as food or ransom.</p><p>Athasian aarakocra are mindful of their physical limitations as well as their comparatively low psionic abilities. They do not normally initiate psionic combat. At the first sign of psionic powers from any of their victims, however, all aarakocra that have some ability will use whatever attack and defense modes they can in an attempt to destroy the threat. Large groups of is or more aarakocra may initiate psionic combat if their leaders feel they can win quickly and avoid physical combat.</p><p>In desperation, an aarakocra can attempt to bite an opponent in combat. Because of the unwieldiness of its beak, the aarakocra has a THAC0 of 18 if attacking with this appendage. Further, the birdman causes only 1d2 points of damage with the beak.</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Habitat/Society:</b> Athasian aarakocra live in tribes with 6-20 (2d8+4) members, depending on the prestige of the leader. The largest tribe ever recorded had 50 members. The tribal hunting territory depends on the size of the tribe, usually about 500 square miles for a tribe of 10 members. There are no rigid boundaries between tribes and border disputes are not uncommon.</p><p>Alignments of tribe members are similar to the alignment of the leader. A tribe that has a leader who is neutral good may have neutral good, chaotic good, lawful good, and true neutral members. A predominantly evil tribe does not recognize boundaries with other tribes and treats other tribes as inferior beings to be eliminated.</p><p>Athasian aarakocra aren't happy in enclosed spaces, but they they take refuge in a cave or building if necessary.</p><p>Nonevil tribes live in rocky aeries in the highest peaks they can find. Evil tribes are normally nomadic and use an aerie made by another tribe if they need to remain in an area for a long time, even if they have to evict the tribe that made the nest.</p><p>Aarakocra aren't friendly toward intruders in their territory, especially caravans. They try to extract a toll from the caravan for passage through the desert. Good-aligned tribes allow unhindered passage of caravans that pay a tribute. If someone refuses to pay the tribute, the aarakocra try to capture scouts or outriders from the party and hold them until an even larger tribute is paid. The payment may be either livestock or shiny objects. Aarakocra are smart enough not to be taken in by glass baubles instead of gems, although they cannot tell the difference between the more common gems and the rare ones.</p><p>Evil tribes ask for tribute and often attack a caravan whether it pays or not. Aarakocra always demand shiny objects such as stones. These tribes find humans and demihumans to be quite tasty and prefer them to other food.</p><p>Good-aligned tribes of aarakocra sometimes return a lost traveler to the edge of the desert after first removing any valuables the traveler may be carrying. On very rare occasions a tribe might return a lost group of travelers to the more frequently traveled parts of the desert, again after first taking any valuables as payment.</p><p>The oldest male is the leader of the tribal hunting party and has 4+4 Hit Dice. The oldest female is in charge of the tribal aerie and has 3+3 HD. In tribes that have more than 15 members, the next oldest aarakocra serves as shaman and has 3+3 HD; the shaman completes the triumvirate necessary for proper worship and the summoning of elementals. (Interestingly, no magic-using aarakocra has ever been recorded.) Tribes without a shaman cannot summon <a href=\"/appendix/element1\">air elementals</a>, which is an important part of aarakocra culture.</p><p>The shaman is the leader of the daily sun worship. Aarakocra worship the sun because it provides them with the thermals they need to soar in search of food. The shaman also leads the mystic rituals used to summon an air elemental. Summoning an air elemental is usually done only in preparation for the tribe's most sacred ceremony, the hunt. Small tribes must band together for this ceremony to allow the triumvirate to be formed.</p><p>The ceremony to summon an air elemental must be conducted at dawn and requires the oldest male and female to emit a highpitched keening whistle. The shaman conducts an intricate dance around them, simultaneously chanting an ancient summoning mantra.</p><p>The hunt is the final part of the initiation of adolescent aarakocra to adulthood and often takes the tribe far from their normal teritory. The target is always a <a href=\"/appendix/drakalsi\">silt drake</a>. The hunt is the only time the females leave the relative safety of the nest. Even an evil tribe will not interfere with a tribe on a hunt. An air elemental is often summoned to help find the drake, but never takes part in the actual combat. Although the adult members of the tribe take part in the initial phases of the combat, it is the initiates who deliver the final, killing blows to me drake. Scars from the hunt are considered a mark of pride among all aarakocra.</p><p>The females spend about eight months of the year incubating their eggs. Athasian aarakocra mate for life and a pair normally produces as many as 10 offspring. A female lays one egg a year. Constant incubation is not required because of the high daytime temperatures, so the females can maintain the nest and keep the tribe's treasure in order.</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Ecology:</b> Athasian aarakocra are high on the food chain and have no natural enemies other than <a href=\"/appendix/drakatha\">drakes</a>. Unless evil, aarakocra leave their own territory only to hunt the silt drake and return as soon as possible when the hunt is over. (Evil aarakocra attack others, as noted above.) Aarakocra eggs and hatchlings are sought after by wealthy land owners who wish to use the creatures as scouts and sentries. An egg can bring as much as 10 cp in Tyr's marketplace. Tribes that have had eggs or hatchlings stolen have long memories and sometimes take revenge against the thief at a later date. Captive aarakocra join any tribe they come in contact with.</p><p>Athasian aarakocra have a natural life span of 21-30 years.</p>\n","images":["<img src=\"grf/ds.gif\" width=\"150\" height=\"75\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Dark Sun\" title=\"Dark Sun\" align=\"right\">","<img src=\"img/aarakath.gif\" alt=\"Aarakocra (Athas)\" title=\"Aarakocra (Athas)\" border=\"0\" width=\"300\" height=\"360\" style=\"text-align:right;\" align=\"right\">","<img src=\"grf/add2_01.gif\" width=\"200\" height=\"56\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Advanced Dungeons & Dragons 2nd Edition\">"],"setting":"Dark Sun","statblock":{"Aarakocra (Athas)":{"Activity Cycle":"Day","Alignment":"Any","Armor Class":"7","Climate/Terrain":"Deep desert","Damage/Attack":"1d3/1d3 or by weapon","Diet":"Carnivore","Frequency":"Rare","Hit Dice":"2+2","Intelligence":"Average (8-10)","Magic Resistance":"Nil","Morale":"Steady (11)","Movement":"6, Fl 36 (C)","No. Appearing":"1d10","No. of Attacks":"2","Organization":"Tribal","Size":"M (20'+ wingspan)","Special Attacks":"Nil","Special Defenses":"Nil","THAC0":"17","Treasure":"Varies","XP Value":"65"}},"title":"Aarakocra (Athas)"},"sources":["2433"],"statblock_names":[],"title":"Aarakocra (Athas)","prev_key":"zygraat","next_key":"aarakocr","monster_path":"/appendix/aarakath"}}},"pageContext":{"monster_key":"keeper","monster_data":{"TSR":["2613"],"fullBody":"  <table cellspacing=\"0\" cellpadding=\"0\"><tr><th>Climate/Terrain:</th><td>Any, the Outlands</td></tr><tr><th>Frequency:</th><td>Very rare</td></tr><tr><th>Organization:</th><td>Group</td></tr><tr><th>Activity Cycle:</th><td>Any</td></tr><tr><th>Diet:</th><td>Omnivore</td></tr><tr><th>Intelligence:</th><td>Exceptional (15-16)</td></tr><tr><th>Treasure:</th><td>Individual K,L,M</td></tr><tr><th>Alignment:</th><td>Lawful neutral</td></tr><tr><th>No. Appearing:</th><td>3-6 (d4+2)</td></tr><tr><th>Armor Class:</th><td>6</td></tr><tr><th>Movement:</th><td>15</td></tr><tr><th>Hit Dice:</th><td>4+4</td></tr><tr><th>THAC0:</th><td>15</td></tr><tr><th>No. of Attacks:</th><td>1</td></tr><tr><th>Damage/Attack:</th><td>1d8+2</td></tr><tr><th>Special Attacks:</th><td>Poison, thief abilities</td></tr><tr><th>Special Defenses:</th><td>Spell immunities</td></tr><tr><th>Magic Resistance:</th><td>40%</td></tr><tr><th>Size:</th><td>M (5-6' tall)</td></tr><tr><th>Morale:</th><td>Fearless (19-20)</td></tr><tr><th>XP Value:</th><td>1,400</td></tr></table><p class=\"f\">Who are the keepers? What is it they want? The scholars of the planes've been baffled by these questions for centuries. It seems every tout's got a chant to rattle about the keepers, but none of 'em really know the dark. All any basher knows for sure is that the keepers show up in the oddest places at the strangest times, demanding information or issuing orders of silence to people just going about their business. It's said that sometimes the keepers do more than rattle their bone-boxes; every now and then a sod who gives the keepers the laugh ends up lost where he won't ever come back.</p><p>Here's a tale told about the keepers: A long time ago, a high-up Guvner learned something abouq the multiverse that no one should ever know. It doesn't really matter what the dark of his knowledge was - depending on who's telling this story, it could've been just about anything, but most versions claim that the Guvner learned how to <i>find</i> entire new universes just by thinking about them. It was something dangerous and accessible to anyone who had the dark of it, so this Guvner decided to make sure that he was the only blood who ever knew how to pull off the trick. So he <i>found</i> a universe where the keepers existed and brought them back to set them after his enemies and rivals.</p><p>At first, the keepers did just what be wanted them to. After all, the Guvner'd just about invented these cutters out of whole cloth, and they were grateful in their own way. But this Guvner got careless with his orders. &ldquo;Make sure no one ever discovers how you got to be here,&rdquo; he told them, and the keepers obliged by killing him.</p><p>When this Guvner disappeared, he'd already called over hundreds or maybe thousands of keepers and set them to doing his work. Each one had been given a different job. See, this Guvner was using the keepers to find things out for him, and to make sure that things he wanted kept dark stayed that way. So after the keeper'd killed him, they were stranded here with nothing but their old commands to tell 'em what to do. People say the keepers're still running on those ancient orders as if on some sacred mission, seeking knowledge and then silencing anyone else as tumbles to it.</p><p>Keepers look human enough at first glance, but their skin's grayish and too shiny, and their movements and gestures are all off. It's as if their bones're put together differently, jointed in the wrong places. Keepers always wear heavy, voluminous clothing that reveals nothing but their hands and faces. They're also noted for wearing dark-lensed spectacles or eye shades of some kind, as if they can't stand bright light.</p><p>If a cutter were ever to get a look at what's under the lenses and clothes, he'd find that a keeper's body is disturbingly rubbery and malleable, without any features whatsoever. Toenails, fingernails, body hair, musculature - nothing shows. It's all smooth, gleaming gray skin. Underneath their lenses, their eye sockets are blank flesh.</p><p>Keepers have a disturbing, abrupt manner to them. They don't understand human customs or etiquette very well, and are either too polite or disgustingly rude. When trying to acquire information from a cutter, they're overbearing and insistent, and can try anything from threats to bribery to theft of items that interest them. When they're trying to suppress information, they'll commonly add murder to their tactics.</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Combat:</b> Keepers like to develop a tactic and stick to it. If they's previously decided to talk their way through an encounter, they'll continue attempting to communicate and avoid physical conflict long after most cutters would've given up. If they've decided that fighting's called for, they strike without warning and do everything in their power to silence their chosen target permanently. Keepers'll try and try again until destroyed rather than contemplate a change in strategy.</p><p>Keepers are surprisingly strong (base 18 Strength), despite their soft and slightly amorphous musculature. In combat, they're able to effect rudimentary changes in their bodies to mimic weapons such as maces or swords. In battle, a keeper's arm might elongate and develop a steel-hard edge, striking like a long sword, or it might transform into a mace-like knot of dense muscle and bone around the fist. Whatever the weapon form, it strikes for 1 to 8 points of damage, +2 for the keeper's Strength bonus.</p><p>Keepers have the ability to spit mild poison to a distance of 20 feet. This requires a normal attack roll, and if the target is hit, it must make a successful saving throw versus poison or be effectively <i>slowed</i> for 2d6 rounds. (The victim isn't really <i>slowed</i> per the spell, but the combination of nausea and nerve spasms has a similar effect.)</p><p>Despite their lack of eyes, keepers see perfectly in any light conditions. A keeper's as skilled as a true knight of the post in some of the stealthy arts. It has the following thief ability scores, and can backstab surprised or unaware opponents for triple damage.<br>PP: 40% OL: 35% MS: 75% HS: 75% CW: 95%</p><p>One last thing a cutter ought to know about keepers: Don't expect to take one prisoner. If the creature's about to be captured, or loses control of its faculties, its body discorporates. In one round the keeper's nothing but a greasy pile of gelatinous lumps on the floor. Keepers save at +4 versus any mind-affecting spell such as <i>command</i>, <i>charm</i>, or <i>domination</i>; if they fail their save anyway, they discorporate as noted above.</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Habitat/Society:</b> Keepers always appear in small groups. In fact, a keeper who's survived the death of all of its companions is 50% likely to discorporate rather than continue existence alone. Despite this, keepers don't seem exceptionally attached to each other, and in fact barely acknowledge each others' presence. Some sages speculate that a group of keepers possesses some form of telepathic group-mind; this seems to be a good guess, since keepers often finish each other's sentences and seem instantly aware of events that befall other members of their group.</p><p>Keepers appear to live only for their &ldquo;mission&rdquo; (presumably the pursuit of knowledge) and ignore all other forms of socialization. A group of keepers visiting an inn will eat their meals in total silence and retire to their quarters immediately afterwards. It's unnerving to look in on keepers in the middle of the night and find the whole group sitting absolutely still in the same poses and relative positions they held several hours before.</p><p>Keepers're likely to get involved with adventurers when the PCs stumble across information or events the keepers're trying to suppress, or when the keepers decide that the PCs may have learned something they need to know. They can be remorseless enemies, but a keeper's interest in anything ceases absolutely once it's decided that the matter doesn't relate to its mission anymore.</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Ecology:</b> Clearly, keepers originated on some world where the rules were different. Their body structure and strange mind processes are indications of their unusual derivation. Most of their normal life functions are performed in a crude attempt to &ldquo;blend in&rdquo; with the population around them, but they often don't get it right. For example, a keeper might observe some people drinking ale in one corner of a tavern, and then drink in imitation - whether its mug holds ale, lamp oil, or hot tar.</p><p>No one knows how keepers replenish their numbers. No one's ever sew a young keeper, or even a female keeper. Questions directed at keepers are likely to be answered with a flat, silent stare.</p>\n","images":["<img src=\"grf/ps.gif\" width=\"150\" height=\"75\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Planescape\" title=\"Planescape\" align=\"right\">","<img src=\"img/keeper.gif\" alt=\"Keeper\" title=\"Keeper\" border=\"0\" width=\"300\" height=\"360\" style=\"text-align:right;\" align=\"right\">","<img src=\"grf/add2_01.gif\" width=\"200\" height=\"56\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Advanced Dungeons & Dragons 2nd Edition\">"],"setting":"Planescape","statblock":{"Keeper":{"Activity Cycle":"Any","Alignment":"Lawful neutral","Armor Class":"6","Climate/Terrain":"Any, the Outlands","Damage/Attack":"1d8+2","Diet":"Omnivore","Frequency":"Very rare","Hit Dice":"4+4","Intelligence":"Exceptional (15-16)","Magic Resistance":"40%","Morale":"Fearless (19-20)","Movement":"15","No. Appearing":"3-6 (d4+2)","No. of Attacks":"1","Organization":"Group","Size":"M (5-6' tall)","Special Attacks":"Poison, thief abilities","Special Defenses":"Spell immunities","THAC0":"15","Treasure":"Individual K,L,M","XP Value":"1,400"}},"title":"Keeper"},"sources":["2613"],"statblock_names":[],"title":"Keeper","prev_key":"kech","next_key":"kelpie","monster_path":"/appendix/keeper"}},"staticQueryHashes":[],"slicesMap":{}}
