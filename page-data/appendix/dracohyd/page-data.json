While the powers listed above are the most common, some aarakocra have different or additional powers.</p><p class=\"f\">A race of intelligent, birdlike creatures living in the deepest deserts of Athas, the rare Athasian <a href=\"/appendix/aarakocr\">aarakocra</a> spends its time soaring on thermals in search of food.</p><p>The aarakocra is 7 to 8 feet tall with a wingspan of 20 feet or more. Because of its large wingspan, an aarakocra can carry as much as 75% of its own body weight and still fly easily. An aarakocra can fly a short distance carrying a burden equaling 125% of its own body weight. The average body weight of a full grown male is 100 pounds and a female is 85 pounds.</p><p>Each wing has a &ldquo;hand&rdquo; at its midpoint, consisting of three fingers and an opposable thumb. The fourth finger forms the rigid leading edge of the wing. In flight the hands cannot be used, but on the ground the aarakocra can use its hands almost as a human would. The aarakocra's body is protected by a thin bony plate on the chest, much like a solid rib cage. Talons on its legs can be used as claws and can be retracted to reveal a second set of hands, also with three fingers and an opposable thumb. Except for the chest plate, the entire skeleton is hollow and extremely fragile.</p><p>From a distance, the Athasian aarakocra resembles a huge <a href=\"/appendix/bird\">vulture</a>. Its black eyes, set in the front of the head, provide excellent vision over a long range. The plumage is generally black with a white collar for adult males and black or brown with a smaller white collar for females. Adolescents are a mixture of brown and black. The beak is large and covers most of the head. Plumage begins at the crown of the head and is darker near the head, except for the collar. Athasian aarakocra speak their own language and the languages of vultures and other large birds. Some speak the common tongue (5% to 10% chance depending on how deep in the wastelands a tribe lives).</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Combat:</b> Aarakocra can fight in the air or on the ground. They prefer aerial combat since their bones are too fragile to withstand a solid blow from a human-sized opponent. In combat against creatures on the ground, they prefer to fly over their victim and drop weighted nets. Some aarakocra use darts to harass ground-based opponents.</p><p>If their opponents can fly, the aarakocra generally forgo the use of the net, although large groups sometimes use nets on flying creatures. Normally, aarakocra attack flying creatures with long spears, diving from above and allowing the momentum to carry the spear through the target. Such an attack doubles the damage if the aarakocra have been able to dive at least 50 feet. Only the very largest aarakocra can carry more than one of these spears, they can attack with both at once with no penalty, causing double damage on each strike. All diving attacks are made at +4 and should be treated as a charge attack. All other penalties and restrictions of charge attacks apply.</p><p>The effect of the aarakocra's nets depends on if the opponent is flying at the time it becomes entangled. Creatures on the ground that are hit by a net are entangled and unable to participate in any combat until they make a successful Strength check to get free of the net. Flying creatures hit by a net can no longer fly and immediately begin falling. If they cannot escape the net or use some magical means to arrest the fall, normal falling damage applies.</p><p>Unless victims are entangled in nets, aarakocra are cautious in ground combat. If the aarakocra outnumber their opponents they advance in a straight line and thrust with their spears. If outnumbered, or the opponents are particularly tough, the aarakocra withdraw. Victims entangled in nets are killed or incapacitated for use as food or ransom.</p><p>Athasian aarakocra are mindful of their physical limitations as well as their comparatively low psionic abilities. They do not normally initiate psionic combat. At the first sign of psionic powers from any of their victims, however, all aarakocra that have some ability will use whatever attack and defense modes they can in an attempt to destroy the threat. Large groups of is or more aarakocra may initiate psionic combat if their leaders feel they can win quickly and avoid physical combat.</p><p>In desperation, an aarakocra can attempt to bite an opponent in combat. Because of the unwieldiness of its beak, the aarakocra has a THAC0 of 18 if attacking with this appendage. Further, the birdman causes only 1d2 points of damage with the beak.</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Habitat/Society:</b> Athasian aarakocra live in tribes with 6-20 (2d8+4) members, depending on the prestige of the leader. The largest tribe ever recorded had 50 members. The tribal hunting territory depends on the size of the tribe, usually about 500 square miles for a tribe of 10 members. There are no rigid boundaries between tribes and border disputes are not uncommon.</p><p>Alignments of tribe members are similar to the alignment of the leader. A tribe that has a leader who is neutral good may have neutral good, chaotic good, lawful good, and true neutral members. A predominantly evil tribe does not recognize boundaries with other tribes and treats other tribes as inferior beings to be eliminated.</p><p>Athasian aarakocra aren't happy in enclosed spaces, but they they take refuge in a cave or building if necessary.</p><p>Nonevil tribes live in rocky aeries in the highest peaks they can find. Evil tribes are normally nomadic and use an aerie made by another tribe if they need to remain in an area for a long time, even if they have to evict the tribe that made the nest.</p><p>Aarakocra aren't friendly toward intruders in their territory, especially caravans. They try to extract a toll from the caravan for passage through the desert. Good-aligned tribes allow unhindered passage of caravans that pay a tribute. If someone refuses to pay the tribute, the aarakocra try to capture scouts or outriders from the party and hold them until an even larger tribute is paid. The payment may be either livestock or shiny objects. Aarakocra are smart enough not to be taken in by glass baubles instead of gems, although they cannot tell the difference between the more common gems and the rare ones.</p><p>Evil tribes ask for tribute and often attack a caravan whether it pays or not. Aarakocra always demand shiny objects such as stones. These tribes find humans and demihumans to be quite tasty and prefer them to other food.</p><p>Good-aligned tribes of aarakocra sometimes return a lost traveler to the edge of the desert after first removing any valuables the traveler may be carrying. On very rare occasions a tribe might return a lost group of travelers to the more frequently traveled parts of the desert, again after first taking any valuables as payment.</p><p>The oldest male is the leader of the tribal hunting party and has 4+4 Hit Dice. The oldest female is in charge of the tribal aerie and has 3+3 HD. In tribes that have more than 15 members, the next oldest aarakocra serves as shaman and has 3+3 HD; the shaman completes the triumvirate necessary for proper worship and the summoning of elementals. (Interestingly, no magic-using aarakocra has ever been recorded.) Tribes without a shaman cannot summon <a href=\"/appendix/element1\">air elementals</a>, which is an important part of aarakocra culture.</p><p>The shaman is the leader of the daily sun worship. Aarakocra worship the sun because it provides them with the thermals they need to soar in search of food. The shaman also leads the mystic rituals used to summon an air elemental. Summoning an air elemental is usually done only in preparation for the tribe's most sacred ceremony, the hunt. Small tribes must band together for this ceremony to allow the triumvirate to be formed.</p><p>The ceremony to summon an air elemental must be conducted at dawn and requires the oldest male and female to emit a highpitched keening whistle. The shaman conducts an intricate dance around them, simultaneously chanting an ancient summoning mantra.</p><p>The hunt is the final part of the initiation of adolescent aarakocra to adulthood and often takes the tribe far from their normal teritory. The target is always a <a href=\"/appendix/drakalsi\">silt drake</a>. The hunt is the only time the females leave the relative safety of the nest. Even an evil tribe will not interfere with a tribe on a hunt. An air elemental is often summoned to help find the drake, but never takes part in the actual combat. Although the adult members of the tribe take part in the initial phases of the combat, it is the initiates who deliver the final, killing blows to me drake. Scars from the hunt are considered a mark of pride among all aarakocra.</p><p>The females spend about eight months of the year incubating their eggs. Athasian aarakocra mate for life and a pair normally produces as many as 10 offspring. A female lays one egg a year. Constant incubation is not required because of the high daytime temperatures, so the females can maintain the nest and keep the tribe's treasure in order.</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Ecology:</b> Athasian aarakocra are high on the food chain and have no natural enemies other than <a href=\"/appendix/drakatha\">drakes</a>. Unless evil, aarakocra leave their own territory only to hunt the silt drake and return as soon as possible when the hunt is over. (Evil aarakocra attack others, as noted above.) Aarakocra eggs and hatchlings are sought after by wealthy land owners who wish to use the creatures as scouts and sentries. An egg can bring as much as 10 cp in Tyr's marketplace. Tribes that have had eggs or hatchlings stolen have long memories and sometimes take revenge against the thief at a later date. Captive aarakocra join any tribe they come in contact with.</p><p>Athasian aarakocra have a natural life span of 21-30 years.</p><p></p><br clear=\"all\" style=\"clear:both; height:0;\">\r\n","images":["<img src=\"grf/ds.gif\" width=\"150\" height=\"75\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Dark Sun\" title=\"Dark Sun\" align=\"right\">","<img src=\"img/aarakath.gif\" alt=\"Aarakocra (Athas)\" title=\"Aarakocra (Athas)\" border=\"0\" width=\"300\" height=\"360\" style=\"text-align:right;\" align=\"right\">","<img src=\"grf/add2_01.gif\" width=\"200\" height=\"56\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Advanced Dungeons & Dragons 2nd Edition\">"],"setting":"Dark Sun","statblock":{"Aarakocra (Athas)":{"Activity Cycle":"Day","Alignment":"Any","Armor Class":"7","Climate/Terrain":"Deep desert","Damage/Attack":"1d3/1d3 or by weapon","Diet":"Carnivore","Frequency":"Rare","Hit Dice":"2+2","Intelligence":"Average (8-10)","Magic Resistance":"Nil","Morale":"Steady (11)","Movement":"6, Fl 36 (C)","No. Appearing":"1d10","No. of Attacks":"2","Organization":"Tribal","Size":"M (20'+ wingspan)","Special Attacks":"Nil","Special Defenses":"Nil","THAC0":"17","Treasure":"Varies","XP Value":"65"}},"title":"Aarakocra (Athas)"},"sources":["2433"],"statblock_names":[],"title":"Aarakocra (Athas)","prev_key":"zygraat","next_key":"aarakocr","monster_path":"/appendix/aarakath"}}},"pageContext":{"monster_key":"dracohyd","monster_data":{"TSR":["9547","9297"],"fullBody":"  <table cellspacing=\"0\" cellpadding=\"0\"><tr><th>Climate/Terrain:</th><td>Temperate/mountains or barrens</td></tr><tr><th>Frequency:</th><td>Very rare</td></tr><tr><th>Organization:</th><td>Solitary</td></tr><tr><th>Activity Cycle:</th><td>Night</td></tr><tr><th>Diet:</th><td>Carnivore</td></tr><tr><th>Intelligence:</th><td>Low (5-7)</td></tr><tr><th>Treasure:</th><td>Special</td></tr><tr><th>Alignment:</th><td>Chaotic evil</td></tr><tr><th>No. Appearing:</th><td>1 (1d4)</td></tr><tr><th>Armor Class:</th><td>2 (base)</td></tr><tr><th>Movement:</th><td>6, Fl 21 (D)</td></tr><tr><th>Hit Dice:</th><td>12 (base)</td></tr><tr><th>THAC0:</th><td>9 (base)</td></tr><tr><th>No. of Attacks:</th><td>4 to 7  (depending on number of heads) + special</td></tr><tr><th>Damage/Attack:</th><td>1d8 (claw)/1d8 (claw)/2d8 (bite, per head.at least 2 bites possible)</td></tr><tr><th>Special Attacks:</th><td>See below</td></tr><tr><th>Special Defenses:</th><td>See below</td></tr><tr><th>Magic Resistance:</th><td>Varies</td></tr><tr><th>Size:</th><td>G (45' base)</td></tr><tr><th>Morale:</th><td>Steady (11-12)</td></tr><tr><th>XP Value:</th><td>Varies</td></tr></table><p class=\"f\">Dracohydras are hideous multiheaded winged monsters that combine the worst features of <a href=\"/appendix/dragon\">dragons</a> and <a href=\"/appendix/hydra\">hydras</a>. Some sages believe they are ancient offshoots of the pre-dragons that have been hibernating for millions of years; others believe they are the next step in the evolution of dragons. Still others think that they are the result of tampering by supernatural beings, such as Tiamat the Chromatic Dragon or other deities. Cult members propose that they are the result of Sammaster's researches into draconic life. In order to better understand how draconic life forms existed, Sammaster created many draco-crossbreeds. Many of these are still in use by Cult cells today. The dracohydra is one such creature.</p><p>Dracohydras have been reported with two to five heads. Twenty-five percent of dracohydras have two heads, 50% have three heads, 15% have four heads, and 10% have five heads.The creatures are a muddy brown color, ranging to a lighter brown, almost a cream, on their bellies. Their eyes are red.Dracohydras speak their own tongue, a derivative of the language of evil dragons. Dracohydras can understand about half of what evil dragons say, and vice versa. Dracohydras know no other languages, but can be taught to understand common by Cult mages.</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Combat:</b> Dracohydras share the same attack routines as standard dragons (including special attacks such as the snatch, plummet, kick, wing buffet, tail slap, and stall described under &ldquo;<a href=\"/appendix/dragon\">Dragon, General</a>&rdquo;). Each round, each of the creature's heads can either bite or use its breath weapon. Heads inflict 2d8 points of damage per bite. The creature's claw attacks inflicts 1d8 points of damage per claw.</p><p>A dracohydra's total hit points are divided as follows: Half the points are assigned to the body (including the wings), and the other half are split evenly between the heads. (For example, say that a three-headed dracohydra has a total of 72 hit points. Its body has 36 hit points, while each of its heads has 12.) When a dracohydra head has been reduced to 0 hit points, the head &ldquo;dies&rdquo; and becomes useless. As soon as all heads are destroyed or the body is reduced to 0 hit points, the dracohydra is dead.</p><p>In combat, 80% of successful frontal attacks against a dracohydra damage a head (random selection); only 20% hit the body. For foes attacking from the side, the odds are reversed: 80% of hits damage the body, while 20% hit a randomly selected head. Foes attacking from the rear always inflict damage to the body.</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Breath Weapon/Special Abilities:</b> Dracohydras spit sprays of concentrated acid similar to the breath weapon of a <a href=\"/appendix/dragcbla\">black dragon</a>. The acid stream is 3 feet wide and extends 40 feet in a straight line from the creature's head. All creatures caught in this stream must roll successful saving throws vs. breath weapon for half damage.</p><p>Each head is able to use its breath weapon independently, dividing the total allowable damage between as many uses as the creature desires. This means that a five-headed great wyrm is an incredibly daunting foe, since each of its five heads can inflict 12d2+12 points of damage. Dracohydras use their special abilities at 8th level, plus their combat modifier. Dracohydras are born with an innate immunity to acid. As they age, they gain the following powers:</p><ul><li><b>Young adult:</b> <i>Wall of fog</i> twice per day.</li><li><b>Adult:</b> <i>Darkness</i> three times per day</li><li><b>Old:</b> <i>Stinking cloud</i> twice per day.</li><li><b>Wyrm:</b> <i>Cloudkill</i> once per day</li></ul><p class=\"f\"><b>Habitat/Society:</b> Wild dracohydras are found in remote mountainous regions far from civilization. They prefer snow-covered peaks around which violent storms often play. Dracohydras are most like white dragons in their outlook: rapacious, selfish, and ferocious. Their low Intelligence makes it difficult for them to plan or think in an abstract manner, so their behavior is most often direct.</p><p>Basically, these beasts are bullies, killing any intruders into their territories even if they are not hungry at the moment. If faced by a strong foe that will not back down, they often run away. Conversely, they enjoy playing with a weaker foe before killing it. This easily manipulated predilection makes them excellent tools of the Cult for those cells &ldquo;lucky&rdquo; enough to have access to them. These cells most commonly use dracohydras as stationary guards of sites important to the Cult. These include secret passageways, treasure or magical item caches, or the ruling member.s (or members.) inner sanctum.</p><p>Dracohydras are by preference solitary, associating with others of their kind only to mate. Offspring remain with the parents only until they reach the young age category. They then either head out on their own or - rarely - challenge one of their parents for its hoard. Parents protect their offspring, but not at the cost of their own lives. Should it look as though continued defense might mean death, the parents flee. Any encounter with more than one dracohydra is with a mated pair with one or two offspring of age category hatchling (60%) or very young (40%).</p><p>Dracohydras hate all other dracoforms. If they think they can get away with it, they will attack other dracoforms on sight. Dracohydras also have no love for humans, demihumans, and humanoids. They sometimes enslave these smaller creatures, but the period of servitude never lasts long before the dracohydra gets hungry and eats its slaves. The Cult works hard to curb these tendencies in those dracohydras it makes use of, since having a dracohydra attack its members and other draconic and dracohybrid servants would be counterproductive. The same strategies of bribery, subterfuge, mental manipulation, and magical charming or domination that the Cult uses on its other servants are employed to good effect to keep its dracohydra &ldquo;allies&rdquo; in line.</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Ecology:</b> Like all draconic creatures, dracohydras can consume almost anything, including nonliving materials such as rocks or gems. They have a rapidly mounting, voracious hunger that they prefer to satisfy with fresh meat. This is the greatest hindrance to the Cult's use of these creatures. The dracohydra must be kept near a large food supply such as a herd of grazing animals or other large, easily tractable beings.</p><p>Like the <a href=\"/appendix/basilisk\">dracolisk</a>, the dracohydra is a distinct species, not a variety of hybrid creature such as the <a href=\"/appendix/dracimer\">dracimera</a>, <a href=\"/appendix/mantidra\">mantidrake</a>, or <a href=\"/appendix/wyvedrak\">wyvern drake</a>. (Its statistics remain stable for its species and do not vary according to its parentage.) The main enemies of dracohydras are <a href=\"/appendix/gianstor\">storm giants</a>, <a href=\"/appendix/gianston\">stone giants</a>, and <a href=\"/appendix/dragcred\">red dragons</a> - who consider the flesh of the creatures' young to be a delicacy.</p><br><table><tr class=\"cn\"><th>Age</th><th>Body (in Feet)</th><th>Tail (in Feet)</th><th>AC</th><th>Breath</th><th>MR</th><th>Treasure</th><th>XP Value</th></tr><tr class=\"cn\"><td style=\"text-align:left; font-weight:bold;\">1 Hatchling</td><td>5-14</td><td>2-6</td><td>5</td><td>1d2+1</td><td>Nil</td><td>Nil</td><td>1,400</td></tr><tr class=\"cn\"><td style=\"text-align:left; font-weight:bold;\">2 Very young</td><td>14-23</td><td>6-12</td><td>4</td><td>2d2+2</td><td>Nil</td><td>Nil</td><td>2,000</td></tr><tr class=\"cn\"><td style=\"text-align:left; font-weight:bold;\">3 Young</td><td>23-32</td><td>12-20</td><td>3</td><td>3d2+3</td><td>Nil</td><td>Nil</td><td>4,000</td></tr><tr class=\"cn\"><td style=\"text-align:left; font-weight:bold;\">4 Juvenile</td><td>32-42</td><td>20-30</td><td>2</td><td>4d2+4</td><td>Nil</td><td>E</td><td>7,000</td></tr><tr class=\"cn\"><td style=\"text-align:left; font-weight:bold;\">5 Young adult</td><td>42-52</td><td>30-40</td><td>1</td><td>5d2+5</td><td>5%</td><td>E,O,S</td><td>9,000</td></tr><tr class=\"cn\"><td style=\"text-align:left; font-weight:bold;\">6 Adult</td><td>52-63</td><td>40-50</td><td>0</td><td>6d2+6</td><td>10%</td><td>E,O,S</td><td>10,000</td></tr><tr class=\"cn\"><td style=\"text-align:left; font-weight:bold;\">7 Mature adult</td><td>63-74</td><td>50-60</td><td>-1</td><td>7d2+7</td><td>15%</td><td>E,O,S</td><td>11,000</td></tr><tr class=\"cn\"><td style=\"text-align:left; font-weight:bold;\">8 Old</td><td>74-85</td><td>60-70</td><td>-2</td><td>8d2+8</td><td>20%</td><td>E,O,S&times;2</td><td>13,000</td></tr><tr class=\"cn\"><td style=\"text-align:left; font-weight:bold;\">9 Very old</td><td>85-96</td><td>70-80</td><td>-3</td><td>9d2+9</td><td>20%</td><td>E,O,S&times;2</td><td>14,000</td></tr><tr class=\"cn\"><td style=\"text-align:left; font-weight:bold;\">10 Venerable</td><td>96-108</td><td>80-90</td><td>-4</td><td>10d2+10</td><td>20%</td><td>E,O,S&times;2</td><td>15,000</td></tr><tr class=\"cn\"><td style=\"text-align:left; font-weight:bold;\">11 Wyrm</td><td>108-120</td><td>90-100</td><td>-5</td><td>11d2+11</td><td>20%</td><td>E,O,S&times;3</td><td>16,000</td></tr><tr class=\"cn\"><td style=\"text-align:left; font-weight:bold;\">12 Great Wyrm</td><td>120-125</td><td>100-105</td><td>-6</td><td>12d2+12</td><td>20%</td><td>E,O,S&times;3</td><td>17,000</td></tr></table><br clear=\"all\" style=\"clear:both; height:0;\">\r\n","images":["<img src=\"grf/fr.gif\" width=\"150\" height=\"75\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Forgotten Realms\" title=\"Forgotten Realms\" align=\"right\">","<img src=\"img/dracohyd.gif\" alt=\"Dracohydra\" title=\"Dracohydra\" border=\"0\" width=\"300\" height=\"360\" style=\"text-align:right;\" align=\"right\">","<img src=\"grf/add2_01.gif\" width=\"200\" height=\"56\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Advanced Dungeons & Dragons 2nd Edition\">"],"setting":"Forgotten Realms","statblock":{"Dracohydra":{"Activity Cycle":"Night","Alignment":"Chaotic evil","Armor Class":"2 (base)","Climate/Terrain":"Temperate/mountains or barrens","Damage/Attack":"1d8 (claw)/1d8 (claw)/2d8 (bite, per head.at least 2 bites possible)","Diet":"Carnivore","Frequency":"Very rare","Hit Dice":"12 (base)","Intelligence":"Low (5-7)","Magic Resistance":"Varies","Morale":"Steady (11-12)","Movement":"6, Fl 21 (D)","No. Appearing":"1 (1d4)","No. of Attacks":"4 to 7  (depending on number of heads) + special","Organization":"Solitary","Size":"G (45' base)","Special Attacks":"See below","Special Defenses":"See below","THAC0":"9 (base)","Treasure":"Special","XP Value":"Varies"}},"title":"Dracohydra"},"sources":["9547","9297"],"statblock_names":[],"title":"Dracohydra","prev_key":"drackapa","next_key":"dracolic","monster_path":"/appendix/dracohyd"}},"staticQueryHashes":[],"slicesMap":{}}
