While the powers listed above are the most common, some aarakocra have different or additional powers.</p><p class=\"f\">A race of intelligent, birdlike creatures living in the deepest deserts of Athas, the rare Athasian <a href=\"/appendix/aarakocr\">aarakocra</a> spends its time soaring on thermals in search of food.</p><p>The aarakocra is 7 to 8 feet tall with a wingspan of 20 feet or more. Because of its large wingspan, an aarakocra can carry as much as 75% of its own body weight and still fly easily. An aarakocra can fly a short distance carrying a burden equaling 125% of its own body weight. The average body weight of a full grown male is 100 pounds and a female is 85 pounds.</p><p>Each wing has a &ldquo;hand&rdquo; at its midpoint, consisting of three fingers and an opposable thumb. The fourth finger forms the rigid leading edge of the wing. In flight the hands cannot be used, but on the ground the aarakocra can use its hands almost as a human would. The aarakocra's body is protected by a thin bony plate on the chest, much like a solid rib cage. Talons on its legs can be used as claws and can be retracted to reveal a second set of hands, also with three fingers and an opposable thumb. Except for the chest plate, the entire skeleton is hollow and extremely fragile.</p><p>From a distance, the Athasian aarakocra resembles a huge <a href=\"/appendix/bird\">vulture</a>. Its black eyes, set in the front of the head, provide excellent vision over a long range. The plumage is generally black with a white collar for adult males and black or brown with a smaller white collar for females. Adolescents are a mixture of brown and black. The beak is large and covers most of the head. Plumage begins at the crown of the head and is darker near the head, except for the collar. Athasian aarakocra speak their own language and the languages of vultures and other large birds. Some speak the common tongue (5% to 10% chance depending on how deep in the wastelands a tribe lives).</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Combat:</b> Aarakocra can fight in the air or on the ground. They prefer aerial combat since their bones are too fragile to withstand a solid blow from a human-sized opponent. In combat against creatures on the ground, they prefer to fly over their victim and drop weighted nets. Some aarakocra use darts to harass ground-based opponents.</p><p>If their opponents can fly, the aarakocra generally forgo the use of the net, although large groups sometimes use nets on flying creatures. Normally, aarakocra attack flying creatures with long spears, diving from above and allowing the momentum to carry the spear through the target. Such an attack doubles the damage if the aarakocra have been able to dive at least 50 feet. Only the very largest aarakocra can carry more than one of these spears, they can attack with both at once with no penalty, causing double damage on each strike. All diving attacks are made at +4 and should be treated as a charge attack. All other penalties and restrictions of charge attacks apply.</p><p>The effect of the aarakocra's nets depends on if the opponent is flying at the time it becomes entangled. Creatures on the ground that are hit by a net are entangled and unable to participate in any combat until they make a successful Strength check to get free of the net. Flying creatures hit by a net can no longer fly and immediately begin falling. If they cannot escape the net or use some magical means to arrest the fall, normal falling damage applies.</p><p>Unless victims are entangled in nets, aarakocra are cautious in ground combat. If the aarakocra outnumber their opponents they advance in a straight line and thrust with their spears. If outnumbered, or the opponents are particularly tough, the aarakocra withdraw. Victims entangled in nets are killed or incapacitated for use as food or ransom.</p><p>Athasian aarakocra are mindful of their physical limitations as well as their comparatively low psionic abilities. They do not normally initiate psionic combat. At the first sign of psionic powers from any of their victims, however, all aarakocra that have some ability will use whatever attack and defense modes they can in an attempt to destroy the threat. Large groups of is or more aarakocra may initiate psionic combat if their leaders feel they can win quickly and avoid physical combat.</p><p>In desperation, an aarakocra can attempt to bite an opponent in combat. Because of the unwieldiness of its beak, the aarakocra has a THAC0 of 18 if attacking with this appendage. Further, the birdman causes only 1d2 points of damage with the beak.</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Habitat/Society:</b> Athasian aarakocra live in tribes with 6-20 (2d8+4) members, depending on the prestige of the leader. The largest tribe ever recorded had 50 members. The tribal hunting territory depends on the size of the tribe, usually about 500 square miles for a tribe of 10 members. There are no rigid boundaries between tribes and border disputes are not uncommon.</p><p>Alignments of tribe members are similar to the alignment of the leader. A tribe that has a leader who is neutral good may have neutral good, chaotic good, lawful good, and true neutral members. A predominantly evil tribe does not recognize boundaries with other tribes and treats other tribes as inferior beings to be eliminated.</p><p>Athasian aarakocra aren't happy in enclosed spaces, but they they take refuge in a cave or building if necessary.</p><p>Nonevil tribes live in rocky aeries in the highest peaks they can find. Evil tribes are normally nomadic and use an aerie made by another tribe if they need to remain in an area for a long time, even if they have to evict the tribe that made the nest.</p><p>Aarakocra aren't friendly toward intruders in their territory, especially caravans. They try to extract a toll from the caravan for passage through the desert. Good-aligned tribes allow unhindered passage of caravans that pay a tribute. If someone refuses to pay the tribute, the aarakocra try to capture scouts or outriders from the party and hold them until an even larger tribute is paid. The payment may be either livestock or shiny objects. Aarakocra are smart enough not to be taken in by glass baubles instead of gems, although they cannot tell the difference between the more common gems and the rare ones.</p><p>Evil tribes ask for tribute and often attack a caravan whether it pays or not. Aarakocra always demand shiny objects such as stones. These tribes find humans and demihumans to be quite tasty and prefer them to other food.</p><p>Good-aligned tribes of aarakocra sometimes return a lost traveler to the edge of the desert after first removing any valuables the traveler may be carrying. On very rare occasions a tribe might return a lost group of travelers to the more frequently traveled parts of the desert, again after first taking any valuables as payment.</p><p>The oldest male is the leader of the tribal hunting party and has 4+4 Hit Dice. The oldest female is in charge of the tribal aerie and has 3+3 HD. In tribes that have more than 15 members, the next oldest aarakocra serves as shaman and has 3+3 HD; the shaman completes the triumvirate necessary for proper worship and the summoning of elementals. (Interestingly, no magic-using aarakocra has ever been recorded.) Tribes without a shaman cannot summon <a href=\"/appendix/element1\">air elementals</a>, which is an important part of aarakocra culture.</p><p>The shaman is the leader of the daily sun worship. Aarakocra worship the sun because it provides them with the thermals they need to soar in search of food. The shaman also leads the mystic rituals used to summon an air elemental. Summoning an air elemental is usually done only in preparation for the tribe's most sacred ceremony, the hunt. Small tribes must band together for this ceremony to allow the triumvirate to be formed.</p><p>The ceremony to summon an air elemental must be conducted at dawn and requires the oldest male and female to emit a highpitched keening whistle. The shaman conducts an intricate dance around them, simultaneously chanting an ancient summoning mantra.</p><p>The hunt is the final part of the initiation of adolescent aarakocra to adulthood and often takes the tribe far from their normal teritory. The target is always a <a href=\"/appendix/drakalsi\">silt drake</a>. The hunt is the only time the females leave the relative safety of the nest. Even an evil tribe will not interfere with a tribe on a hunt. An air elemental is often summoned to help find the drake, but never takes part in the actual combat. Although the adult members of the tribe take part in the initial phases of the combat, it is the initiates who deliver the final, killing blows to me drake. Scars from the hunt are considered a mark of pride among all aarakocra.</p><p>The females spend about eight months of the year incubating their eggs. Athasian aarakocra mate for life and a pair normally produces as many as 10 offspring. A female lays one egg a year. Constant incubation is not required because of the high daytime temperatures, so the females can maintain the nest and keep the tribe's treasure in order.</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Ecology:</b> Athasian aarakocra are high on the food chain and have no natural enemies other than <a href=\"/appendix/drakatha\">drakes</a>. Unless evil, aarakocra leave their own territory only to hunt the silt drake and return as soon as possible when the hunt is over. (Evil aarakocra attack others, as noted above.) Aarakocra eggs and hatchlings are sought after by wealthy land owners who wish to use the creatures as scouts and sentries. An egg can bring as much as 10 cp in Tyr's marketplace. Tribes that have had eggs or hatchlings stolen have long memories and sometimes take revenge against the thief at a later date. Captive aarakocra join any tribe they come in contact with.</p><p>Athasian aarakocra have a natural life span of 21-30 years.</p><p></p><br clear=\"all\" style=\"clear:both; height:0;\">\r\n","images":["<img src=\"grf/ds.gif\" width=\"150\" height=\"75\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Dark Sun\" title=\"Dark Sun\" align=\"right\">","<img src=\"img/aarakath.gif\" alt=\"Aarakocra (Athas)\" title=\"Aarakocra (Athas)\" border=\"0\" width=\"300\" height=\"360\" style=\"text-align:right;\" align=\"right\">","<img src=\"grf/add2_01.gif\" width=\"200\" height=\"56\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Advanced Dungeons & Dragons 2nd Edition\">"],"setting":"Dark Sun","statblock":{"Aarakocra (Athas)":{"Activity Cycle":"Day","Alignment":"Any","Armor Class":"7","Climate/Terrain":"Deep desert","Damage/Attack":"1d3/1d3 or by weapon","Diet":"Carnivore","Frequency":"Rare","Hit Dice":"2+2","Intelligence":"Average (8-10)","Magic Resistance":"Nil","Morale":"Steady (11)","Movement":"6, Fl 36 (C)","No. Appearing":"1d10","No. of Attacks":"2","Organization":"Tribal","Size":"M (20'+ wingspan)","Special Attacks":"Nil","Special Defenses":"Nil","THAC0":"17","Treasure":"Varies","XP Value":"65"}},"title":"Aarakocra (Athas)"},"sources":["2433"],"statblock_names":[],"title":"Aarakocra (Athas)","prev_key":"zygraat","next_key":"aarakocr","monster_path":"/appendix/aarakath"}}},"pageContext":{"monster_key":"clwohorr","monster_data":{"TSR":["2109","2173"],"fullBody":"  <table cellspacing=\"0\" cellpadding=\"0\"><tr class=\"bk\"><th> </th><th class=\"cn\">Copper</th><th class=\"cn\">Silver</th><th class=\"cn\">Electrum</th><th class=\"cn\">Gold</th><th class=\"cn\">Platinum</th><th class=\"cn\">Adamantite</th></tr><tr><th>Climate/Terrain:</th><td>Any nonaquatic</td><td>Any nonaquatic</td><td>Any nonaquatic</td><td>Any nonaquatic</td><td>Any nonaquatic</td><td>Any nonaquatic</td></tr><tr><th>Frequency:</th><td>Uncommon</td><td>Rare</td><td>Rare</td><td>Very rare</td><td>Unique</td><td>Unique</td></tr><tr><th>Organization:</th><td>Race</td><td>Race</td><td>Race</td><td>Race</td><td>Race</td><td>Race</td></tr><tr><th>Activity Cycle:</th><td>Any</td><td>Any</td><td>Any</td><td>Any</td><td>Any</td><td>Any</td></tr><tr><th>Diet:</th><td>None</td><td>None</td><td>None</td><td>None</td><td>None</td><td>None</td></tr><tr><th>Intelligence:</th><td>Low (5-7)</td><td>Average (8-10)</td><td>Very (11-12)</td><td>High (13-14)</td><td>Exceptional (15-16)</td><td>Genius (17-18)</td></tr><tr><th>Treasure:</th><td>Nil</td><td>Nil</td><td>Nil</td><td>Nil</td><td>Nil</td><td>Nil</td></tr><tr><th>Alignment:</th><td>Lawful evil</td><td>Lawful evil</td><td>Lawful evil</td><td>Lawful evil</td><td>Lawful evil</td><td>Lawful evil</td></tr><tr><th>No. Appearing:</th><td>2-20</td><td>1-10</td><td>1-6</td><td>1</td><td>1</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><th>Armor Class:</th><td>4</td><td>2</td><td>0</td><td>-2</td><td>-4</td><td>-6</td></tr><tr><th>Movement:</th><td>9</td><td>9</td><td>9</td><td>9</td><td>9</td><td>9</td></tr><tr><th>Hit Dice:</th><td>2</td><td>3</td><td>4</td><td>5</td><td>6</td><td>7</td></tr><tr><th>THAC0:</th><td>19</td><td>17</td><td>17</td><td>15</td><td>15</td><td>13</td></tr><tr><th>No. of Attacks:</th><td>1</td><td>1</td><td>1</td><td>1</td><td>1</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><th>Damage/Attack:</th><td>1d4</td><td>1d6</td><td>1d8</td><td>1d10</td><td>1d12</td><td>1d20</td></tr><tr><th>Special Attacks:</th><td>Nil</td><td>Spring caster</td><td>Steam caster</td><td>Lightning rod</td><td>Lightning rod</td><td>Disintegrate</td></tr><tr><th>Special Defenses:</th><td>See below</td><td>See below</td><td>See below</td><td>See below</td><td>See below</td><td>See below</td></tr><tr><th>Magic Resistance:</th><td>10%</td><td>20%</td><td>30%</td><td>50%</td><td>70%</td><td>90%</td></tr><tr><th>Size:</th><td>S (2' dia.)</td><td>S (2' dia.)</td><td>S (2' dia.)</td><td>S (2' dia.)</td><td>S (2' dia.)</td><td>S (2' dia.)</td></tr><tr><th>Morale:</th><td>Fearless (20)</td><td>Fearless (20)</td><td>Fearless (20)</td><td>Fearless (20)</td><td>Fearless (20)</td><td>Fearless (20)</td></tr><tr><th>XP Value:</th><td>65</td><td>120</td><td>175</td><td>975</td><td>1,400</td><td>6,000</td></tr></table><p class=\"f\"><img src=\"/img/spc/clwohorr.gif\" width=\"300\" height=\"360\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Clockwork Horror\" style=\"float:right;\">If one thinks of campaign worlds as single cells in the body of the cosmos, then one must certainly think of clockwork horrors as viruses that have come to destroy that body.</p><p>Clockwork horrors are a form of arcane apparatus. They look something like a mechanical <a href=\"/appendix/spider\">spider</a> (though they have only four legs). While the body of the horror is only about two feet in diameter, the legs give the creature an overall diameter of about four feet. In the front of the body is a crystal that enables the horror to see. Two depressions, one on each side of this lens, serve the horror as hearing organs. Two limbs, located roughly below the hearing dishes, serve a number of purposes described later.</p><p>The body of a clockwork horror is always cast as a single piece from some type of metal. The most common type of horror is created from copper, but others may be cast from silver, electrum, gold, platinum or even adamantite. The surface of the body is always highly polished and covered with pulsating runes of mystical power.</p><p>Clockwork horrors communicate with each other by means of clicks, whirs, and similar mechanical sounds. The exact nature of their language is unknown. It is believed, however, that the horrors use a type of dot-and-dash code similar to that employed by sailors when they signal each other with lights.</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Combat:</b> All clockwork horrors share the same special defenses. They are immune to all spells that depend on biological functions for their effects. Examples of these include <i>cure</i> or <i>cause wounds</i>, <i>feign death</i>, <i>polymorph other</i>, and <i>cloudkill</i>. In addition all mind-affecting spells, such as <i>charm</i>, <i>hypnotize</i>, or <i>fear</i>, have no effect on them; nor do psionic attack modes. They can be affected only by attacks that have some power over nonliving objects. A <i>shatter</i> spell directed at the horror's seeing crystal will blind it for one round per level of the caster. Similarly, a <i>dispel magic</i> spell focused on a single horror paralyzes the horror for a like duration.</p><p>In addition, all horrors are immune to electricity-based attacks of any type. Heat and cold affect them normally, as do all other types of spells not specifically excluded.</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Habitat/Society:</b> The wisest sages tell of an ancient humanoid race, known only as the &ldquo;Lost Ones&rdquo;. Records of their origin have long since faded, but frightening tales are told of their demise.</p><p>The Lost Ones were fond of mechanisms. The more subtle and clever their devices, the better they liked them. In the end, however, their own love of such toys brought them down. One of their most brilliant artificers built a magnificent adamantite machine with workings so advanced that none but he could fathom its operation. In addition, he wove powerful spells about the contraption, bestowing on it intelligence and mystical abilities. In gratitude for its creation, the adamantite machine destroyed him.</p><p>Over the course of the next few decades, the adamantite horror built an army of mechanical followers, each in its own image, but of lesser quality. As the horrors rose to power in their sphere, they eliminated all biological life in it. In the end, they tore apart the worlds in their sphere and used the raw materials thus obtained to build more and more horrors.</p><p>Centuries passed for the horrors contained in the sphere of the Lost Ones. They would have been forever doomed to remain there had they not been visited by a fleet of <a href=\"/appendix/neogi\">neogi</a> deathspiders. The neogi had come seeking slaves and &ldquo;cattle&rdquo; to feast upon. Instead, they found death. One by one, their ships were taken from them. In the end the neogi and their slaves found themselves forced into <i>lifejammers</i> (spelljamming ships powered by life energy instead of magic).</p><p>Now able to journey between crystal spheres, the clockwork horrors began to spread. Each crystal sphere they entered was violated and the worlds within were plundered. For those living in these doomed spheres, there was no escape.</p><p>The society of clockwork horrors, if one can call it that, is a rigid, almost military one. Horrors have no individual identities. Rather, they have a mission: the race must survive.</p><p>Once the clockwork horrors have established a foothold on a world, they see all living things on that world as a threat. Logically, to the horrors, such cultures must be removed - and removal of living things is one thing at which the clockwork horrors are expert.</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Ecology:</b> The clockwork horrors are not natural creatures, but make radical changes in the worlds they visit. They sometimes temporarily enslave intelligent races, keeping hopes of some  accommodation alive until they have total control. They also take occasional prisoners to study and analyze species weaknesses.</p><p>A clockwork horror fleet, which nearly always consists of 10d10 captured neogi ships, leaves the worlds it visits stripped of their natural resources. Metals are strip-mined, living things are removed as useless and troublesome, and everything that can be exploited is drained away. This process takes only two or three centuries.</p><p>The powerful weapons of the clockwork horrors are highly prized by most artificers. While they do not retain their powers after removal from the horrors, they are nonetheless interesting to study.</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Copper Horror</b></p><p class=\"ni\">The copper horror is the most commonly encountered horror. While all of the other horrors have a built-in weapon of some type, the copper horror is not so equipped. Copper horrors serve as the menial workers of the race. The special appendages that they use in their daily labors, however, can often be used in combat with some success. When a copper horror is forced to engage in melee, the mechanism can be used to make one attack that inflicts 1d4 points of damage. The exact nature of the attack may vary (S, P, or B), depending on the task to which the copper horror was assigned.</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Silver Horror</b></p><p class=\"ni\">The silver horror is somewhat less common that its copper kin, but is far more dangerous. The silver horror is the warrior of the race. It is most often encountered as a patrol or guard at work sites or in horror-dominated regions.</p><p>The right manipulator arm of the silver horror is fashioned to serve a dual purpose. Besides enabling the silver horror to grasp and handle items in the manner of a human hand, it can present sharp blades for combat. Once extended, these spin at high speed, turning the manipulator into a deadly rotating saw that strikes for 1d6 points of damage.</p><p>The silver horror has a missile weapon as well. Where the copper horror has a secondary manipulating arm, the silver horror has a hollow black tube. This weapon, a <i>spring caster</i>, is a clockwork-driven device that ejects a barbed dart at high veltocity. The dart has ranges of 10/20/40 yards and inflicts 1d3 points of damage. The spring caster can fire once per round.</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Electrum Horror</b></p><p class=\"ni\">The electrum horror fills the role of commanding officer or overseer. It often leads patrols of silver horros or directs the operations of large numbers of copper horrors.</p><p>The electrum horror is equipped with the same combination manipulator/razor saw found on the silver horror. However, the electrum razor saw is sharper and more dangerous, inflicting 1d8 points of damage with a successful hit.</p><p>Where the silver horror has a spring caster, however, the electrum horror is armed with a <i>steam caster</i>. The steam caster uses a jet of high pressure steam to fire its missiles. As with the spring caster, the rate of fire is but one per round. The range of the steam caster is 20/40/80 yards, and the damage inflicted by a hit is 2d4 points.</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Gold Horror</b></p><p class=\"ni\">The gold horror is a high-ranking member of the clockwork horror social structure. As a rule, there is only one gold horror to a planet, and its task is the direction of all horror operations on that world. Besides its keen intelligence, the gold horror's combat abilities make it more than able to carry out its mission.</p><p>The gold horror's razor saw is one of the sharpest cutting devices known. In combat, it inflicts 1d10 points of damage. The gold horror's second arm is a black tube known as a <i>lightning rod</i>. Once every other combat round, the rod can unleash a stroke of lightning that functions just as the 3rd-level wizard spell, <i>lightning bolt</i>, but inflicting 3d6 points of damage. A saving throw vs. spell is allowed for half damage.</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Platinum Horror</b></p><p class=\"ni\">Seldom will more that one platinum horror be found in a given crystal sphere (campaign universe). Where gold horrors direct the actions of the lesser clockwork horrors, the platinum horror directs the gold horrors.</p><p>The weapons of the platinum horror are the same as those of the gold horror: the razor saw and lightning rod. However, the platinum razor saw inflicts 1d12 points of damage and the lightning rod can fire every round for 4d8 points of damage. A saving throw vs. spell is allowed for half damage.</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Adamantite Horror</b></p><p class=\"ni\">The so-called &ldquo;father&rdquo; of the clockwork horror race, only one adamantite horror is known to exist. A cold and calculating entity, the adamantite horror is fond of intricate strategies and devious planning.</p><p>When drawn into actual combat, a rare occurrence, the adamantite horror is far from helpless. Its first line of defense is its trusty razor saw. More dangerous than the saw of the platinum horror, the adamantite razor saw inflicts 1d20 damage with a successful attack.</p><p>The adamantite horror has no lightning rod, but wields a weapon known as the <i>nightmare stick</i>. Each round, the nightmare stick functions as the 6th-level wizard spell, <i>disintegrate</i>, with a 50-yard range. A saving throw vs. spell is allowed to avoid the deadly effect.</p><p></p><br clear=\"all\" style=\"clear:both; height:0;\">\r\n","images":["<img src=\"grf/sj.gif\" width=\"150\" height=\"75\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Spelljammer\" title=\"Spelljammer\" align=\"right\">","<img src=\"/img/spc/clwohorr.gif\" width=\"300\" height=\"360\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Clockwork Horror\" style=\"float:right;\">","<img src=\"grf/add2_01.gif\" width=\"200\" height=\"56\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Advanced Dungeons & Dragons 2nd Edition\">"],"setting":"Spelljammer","statblock":{"Adamantite":{"Activity Cycle":"Any","Alignment":"Lawful evil","Armor Class":"-6","Climate/Terrain":"Any nonaquatic","Damage/Attack":"1d20","Diet":"None","Frequency":"Unique","Hit Dice":"7","Intelligence":"Genius (17-18)","Magic Resistance":"90%","Morale":"Fearless (20)","Movement":"9","No. Appearing":"1","No. of Attacks":"1","Organization":"Race","Size":"S (2' dia.)","Special Attacks":"Disintegrate","Special Defenses":"See below","THAC0":"13","Treasure":"Nil","XP Value":"6,000"},"Copper":{"Activity Cycle":"Any","Alignment":"Lawful evil","Armor Class":"4","Climate/Terrain":"Any nonaquatic","Damage/Attack":"1d4","Diet":"None","Frequency":"Uncommon","Hit Dice":"2","Intelligence":"Low (5-7)","Magic Resistance":"10%","Morale":"Fearless (20)","Movement":"9","No. Appearing":"2-20","No. of Attacks":"1","Organization":"Race","Size":"S (2' dia.)","Special Attacks":"Nil","Special Defenses":"See below","THAC0":"19","Treasure":"Nil","XP Value":"65"},"Electrum":{"Activity Cycle":"Any","Alignment":"Lawful evil","Armor Class":"0","Climate/Terrain":"Any nonaquatic","Damage/Attack":"1d8","Diet":"None","Frequency":"Rare","Hit Dice":"4","Intelligence":"Very (11-12)","Magic Resistance":"30%","Morale":"Fearless (20)","Movement":"9","No. Appearing":"1-6","No. of Attacks":"1","Organization":"Race","Size":"S (2' dia.)","Special Attacks":"Steam caster","Special Defenses":"See below","THAC0":"17","Treasure":"Nil","XP Value":"175"},"Gold":{"Activity Cycle":"Any","Alignment":"Lawful evil","Armor Class":"-2","Climate/Terrain":"Any nonaquatic","Damage/Attack":"1d10","Diet":"None","Frequency":"Very rare","Hit Dice":"5","Intelligence":"High (13-14)","Magic Resistance":"50%","Morale":"Fearless (20)","Movement":"9","No. Appearing":"1","No. of Attacks":"1","Organization":"Race","Size":"S (2' dia.)","Special Attacks":"Lightning rod","Special Defenses":"See below","THAC0":"15","Treasure":"Nil","XP Value":"975"},"Platinum":{"Activity Cycle":"Any","Alignment":"Lawful evil","Armor Class":"-4","Climate/Terrain":"Any nonaquatic","Damage/Attack":"1d12","Diet":"None","Frequency":"Unique","Hit Dice":"6","Intelligence":"Exceptional (15-16)","Magic Resistance":"70%","Morale":"Fearless (20)","Movement":"9","No. Appearing":"1","No. of Attacks":"1","Organization":"Race","Size":"S (2' dia.)","Special Attacks":"Lightning rod","Special Defenses":"See below","THAC0":"15","Treasure":"Nil","XP Value":"1,400"},"Silver":{"Activity Cycle":"Any","Alignment":"Lawful evil","Armor Class":"2","Climate/Terrain":"Any nonaquatic","Damage/Attack":"1d6","Diet":"None","Frequency":"Rare","Hit Dice":"3","Intelligence":"Average (8-10)","Magic Resistance":"20%","Morale":"Fearless (20)","Movement":"9","No. Appearing":"1-10","No. of Attacks":"1","Organization":"Race","Size":"S (2' dia.)","Special Attacks":"Spring caster","Special Defenses":"See below","THAC0":"17","Treasure":"Nil","XP Value":"120"}},"title":"Clockwork Horror"},"sources":["2109","2173"],"statblock_names":[],"title":"Clockwork Horror","prev_key":"cluricha","next_key":"clwoswma","monster_path":"/appendix/clwohorr"}},"staticQueryHashes":[],"slicesMap":{}}
