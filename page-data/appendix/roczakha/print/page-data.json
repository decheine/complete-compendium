While the powers listed above are the most common, some aarakocra have different or additional powers.</p><p class=\"f\">A race of intelligent, birdlike creatures living in the deepest deserts of Athas, the rare Athasian <a href=\"/appendix/aarakocr\">aarakocra</a> spends its time soaring on thermals in search of food.</p><p>The aarakocra is 7 to 8 feet tall with a wingspan of 20 feet or more. Because of its large wingspan, an aarakocra can carry as much as 75% of its own body weight and still fly easily. An aarakocra can fly a short distance carrying a burden equaling 125% of its own body weight. The average body weight of a full grown male is 100 pounds and a female is 85 pounds.</p><p>Each wing has a &ldquo;hand&rdquo; at its midpoint, consisting of three fingers and an opposable thumb. The fourth finger forms the rigid leading edge of the wing. In flight the hands cannot be used, but on the ground the aarakocra can use its hands almost as a human would. The aarakocra's body is protected by a thin bony plate on the chest, much like a solid rib cage. Talons on its legs can be used as claws and can be retracted to reveal a second set of hands, also with three fingers and an opposable thumb. Except for the chest plate, the entire skeleton is hollow and extremely fragile.</p><p>From a distance, the Athasian aarakocra resembles a huge <a href=\"/appendix/bird\">vulture</a>. Its black eyes, set in the front of the head, provide excellent vision over a long range. The plumage is generally black with a white collar for adult males and black or brown with a smaller white collar for females. Adolescents are a mixture of brown and black. The beak is large and covers most of the head. Plumage begins at the crown of the head and is darker near the head, except for the collar. Athasian aarakocra speak their own language and the languages of vultures and other large birds. Some speak the common tongue (5% to 10% chance depending on how deep in the wastelands a tribe lives).</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Combat:</b> Aarakocra can fight in the air or on the ground. They prefer aerial combat since their bones are too fragile to withstand a solid blow from a human-sized opponent. In combat against creatures on the ground, they prefer to fly over their victim and drop weighted nets. Some aarakocra use darts to harass ground-based opponents.</p><p>If their opponents can fly, the aarakocra generally forgo the use of the net, although large groups sometimes use nets on flying creatures. Normally, aarakocra attack flying creatures with long spears, diving from above and allowing the momentum to carry the spear through the target. Such an attack doubles the damage if the aarakocra have been able to dive at least 50 feet. Only the very largest aarakocra can carry more than one of these spears, they can attack with both at once with no penalty, causing double damage on each strike. All diving attacks are made at +4 and should be treated as a charge attack. All other penalties and restrictions of charge attacks apply.</p><p>The effect of the aarakocra's nets depends on if the opponent is flying at the time it becomes entangled. Creatures on the ground that are hit by a net are entangled and unable to participate in any combat until they make a successful Strength check to get free of the net. Flying creatures hit by a net can no longer fly and immediately begin falling. If they cannot escape the net or use some magical means to arrest the fall, normal falling damage applies.</p><p>Unless victims are entangled in nets, aarakocra are cautious in ground combat. If the aarakocra outnumber their opponents they advance in a straight line and thrust with their spears. If outnumbered, or the opponents are particularly tough, the aarakocra withdraw. Victims entangled in nets are killed or incapacitated for use as food or ransom.</p><p>Athasian aarakocra are mindful of their physical limitations as well as their comparatively low psionic abilities. They do not normally initiate psionic combat. At the first sign of psionic powers from any of their victims, however, all aarakocra that have some ability will use whatever attack and defense modes they can in an attempt to destroy the threat. Large groups of is or more aarakocra may initiate psionic combat if their leaders feel they can win quickly and avoid physical combat.</p><p>In desperation, an aarakocra can attempt to bite an opponent in combat. Because of the unwieldiness of its beak, the aarakocra has a THAC0 of 18 if attacking with this appendage. Further, the birdman causes only 1d2 points of damage with the beak.</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Habitat/Society:</b> Athasian aarakocra live in tribes with 6-20 (2d8+4) members, depending on the prestige of the leader. The largest tribe ever recorded had 50 members. The tribal hunting territory depends on the size of the tribe, usually about 500 square miles for a tribe of 10 members. There are no rigid boundaries between tribes and border disputes are not uncommon.</p><p>Alignments of tribe members are similar to the alignment of the leader. A tribe that has a leader who is neutral good may have neutral good, chaotic good, lawful good, and true neutral members. A predominantly evil tribe does not recognize boundaries with other tribes and treats other tribes as inferior beings to be eliminated.</p><p>Athasian aarakocra aren't happy in enclosed spaces, but they they take refuge in a cave or building if necessary.</p><p>Nonevil tribes live in rocky aeries in the highest peaks they can find. Evil tribes are normally nomadic and use an aerie made by another tribe if they need to remain in an area for a long time, even if they have to evict the tribe that made the nest.</p><p>Aarakocra aren't friendly toward intruders in their territory, especially caravans. They try to extract a toll from the caravan for passage through the desert. Good-aligned tribes allow unhindered passage of caravans that pay a tribute. If someone refuses to pay the tribute, the aarakocra try to capture scouts or outriders from the party and hold them until an even larger tribute is paid. The payment may be either livestock or shiny objects. Aarakocra are smart enough not to be taken in by glass baubles instead of gems, although they cannot tell the difference between the more common gems and the rare ones.</p><p>Evil tribes ask for tribute and often attack a caravan whether it pays or not. Aarakocra always demand shiny objects such as stones. These tribes find humans and demihumans to be quite tasty and prefer them to other food.</p><p>Good-aligned tribes of aarakocra sometimes return a lost traveler to the edge of the desert after first removing any valuables the traveler may be carrying. On very rare occasions a tribe might return a lost group of travelers to the more frequently traveled parts of the desert, again after first taking any valuables as payment.</p><p>The oldest male is the leader of the tribal hunting party and has 4+4 Hit Dice. The oldest female is in charge of the tribal aerie and has 3+3 HD. In tribes that have more than 15 members, the next oldest aarakocra serves as shaman and has 3+3 HD; the shaman completes the triumvirate necessary for proper worship and the summoning of elementals. (Interestingly, no magic-using aarakocra has ever been recorded.) Tribes without a shaman cannot summon <a href=\"/appendix/element1\">air elementals</a>, which is an important part of aarakocra culture.</p><p>The shaman is the leader of the daily sun worship. Aarakocra worship the sun because it provides them with the thermals they need to soar in search of food. The shaman also leads the mystic rituals used to summon an air elemental. Summoning an air elemental is usually done only in preparation for the tribe's most sacred ceremony, the hunt. Small tribes must band together for this ceremony to allow the triumvirate to be formed.</p><p>The ceremony to summon an air elemental must be conducted at dawn and requires the oldest male and female to emit a highpitched keening whistle. The shaman conducts an intricate dance around them, simultaneously chanting an ancient summoning mantra.</p><p>The hunt is the final part of the initiation of adolescent aarakocra to adulthood and often takes the tribe far from their normal teritory. The target is always a <a href=\"/appendix/drakalsi\">silt drake</a>. The hunt is the only time the females leave the relative safety of the nest. Even an evil tribe will not interfere with a tribe on a hunt. An air elemental is often summoned to help find the drake, but never takes part in the actual combat. Although the adult members of the tribe take part in the initial phases of the combat, it is the initiates who deliver the final, killing blows to me drake. Scars from the hunt are considered a mark of pride among all aarakocra.</p><p>The females spend about eight months of the year incubating their eggs. Athasian aarakocra mate for life and a pair normally produces as many as 10 offspring. A female lays one egg a year. Constant incubation is not required because of the high daytime temperatures, so the females can maintain the nest and keep the tribe's treasure in order.</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Ecology:</b> Athasian aarakocra are high on the food chain and have no natural enemies other than <a href=\"/appendix/drakatha\">drakes</a>. Unless evil, aarakocra leave their own territory only to hunt the silt drake and return as soon as possible when the hunt is over. (Evil aarakocra attack others, as noted above.) Aarakocra eggs and hatchlings are sought after by wealthy land owners who wish to use the creatures as scouts and sentries. An egg can bring as much as 10 cp in Tyr's marketplace. Tribes that have had eggs or hatchlings stolen have long memories and sometimes take revenge against the thief at a later date. Captive aarakocra join any tribe they come in contact with.</p><p>Athasian aarakocra have a natural life span of 21-30 years.</p>\n","images":["<img src=\"grf/ds.gif\" width=\"150\" height=\"75\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Dark Sun\" title=\"Dark Sun\" align=\"right\">","<img src=\"img/aarakath.gif\" alt=\"Aarakocra (Athas)\" title=\"Aarakocra (Athas)\" border=\"0\" width=\"300\" height=\"360\" style=\"text-align:right;\" align=\"right\">","<img src=\"grf/add2_01.gif\" width=\"200\" height=\"56\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Advanced Dungeons & Dragons 2nd Edition\">"],"setting":"Dark Sun","statblock":{"Aarakocra (Athas)":{"Activity Cycle":"Day","Alignment":"Any","Armor Class":"7","Climate/Terrain":"Deep desert","Damage/Attack":"1d3/1d3 or by weapon","Diet":"Carnivore","Frequency":"Rare","Hit Dice":"2+2","Intelligence":"Average (8-10)","Magic Resistance":"Nil","Morale":"Steady (11)","Movement":"6, Fl 36 (C)","No. Appearing":"1d10","No. of Attacks":"2","Organization":"Tribal","Size":"M (20'+ wingspan)","Special Attacks":"Nil","Special Defenses":"Nil","THAC0":"17","Treasure":"Varies","XP Value":"65"}},"title":"Aarakocra (Athas)"},"sources":["2433"],"statblock_names":[],"title":"Aarakocra (Athas)","prev_key":"zygraat","next_key":"aarakocr","monster_path":"/appendix/aarakath"}}},"pageContext":{"monster_key":"roczakha","monster_data":{"TSR":["1077"],"fullBody":"  <table cellspacing=\"0\" cellpadding=\"0\"><tr class=\"bk\"><th> </th><th class=\"cn\">Common Roc</th><th class=\"cn\">Great Roc</th><th class=\"cn\">Two-headed Roc</th></tr><tr><th>Climate/Terrain:</th><td>Semitropical/mountains/ocean</td><td>Semitropical/mountains/ocean</td><td>Semitropical/mountains/ocean</td></tr><tr><th>Frequency:</th><td>Rare</td><td>Very rare</td><td>Very rare</td></tr><tr><th>Organization:</th><td>Solitary</td><td>Solitary</td><td>Solitary</td></tr><tr><th>Activity Cycle:</th><td>Day</td><td>Day</td><td>Day</td></tr><tr><th>Diet:</th><td>Omnivore</td><td>Omnivore</td><td>Omnivore</td></tr><tr><th>Intelligence:</th><td>Animal (1)</td><td>Low (5-7)</td><td>Low (5-7)</td></tr><tr><th>Treasure:</th><td>C</td><td>D</td><td>D</td></tr><tr><th>Alignment:</th><td>Neutral</td><td>Neutral</td><td>Chaotic evil</td></tr><tr><th>No. Appearing:</th><td>1-2</td><td>1</td><td>1-2</td></tr><tr><th>Armor Class:</th><td>4</td><td>2</td><td></td></tr><tr><th>Movement:</th><td>3, Fl 30 (C)</td><td>3, Fl 24 (C)</td><td>34, FL 24 (C)</td></tr><tr><th>Hit Dice:</th><td>18</td><td>24</td><td>16</td></tr><tr><th>THAC0:</th><td>5</td><td>5</td><td>5</td></tr><tr><th>No. of Attacks:</th><td>2 claw or 1 bite</td><td>2 claw or 1 bite</td><td>2 claw or 1 bite</td></tr><tr><th>Damage/Attack:</th><td>3-18/3-18 or 4-24 (3d6/3d6 or 4d6)</td><td>4-24/4-24 or 6-36 (4d6/4d6 or 6d6)</td><td>3-18/3-18 or 4-24/4-24 (3d6/3d6 or 4d6/4d6)</td></tr><tr><th>Special Attacks:</th><td>Swoop with -5 to opponent's surprise; snare (95% chance or better)</td><td>Boulder attack (3d10)</td><td>Boulder attack (3d10/3d10)</td></tr><tr><th>Special Defenses:</th><td>Nil</td><td>Nil</td><td>Nil</td></tr><tr><th>Magic Resistance:</th><td>Nil</td><td>Nil</td><td>Nil</td></tr><tr><th>Size:</th><td>G (60 ft. long, 120.ft. wingspan)</td><td>G (120 ft. long, 270-ft. wingspan)</td><td>G (60 ft. long, 120.ft. wingspan)</td></tr><tr><th>Morale:</th><td>Steady (11)</td><td>Elite (13)</td><td>Elite (13)</td></tr><tr><th>XP Value:</th><td>12,000</td><td>18,000</td><td>14,000</td></tr></table><p class=\"f\">Rocs are huge raptors that dwell in Zakharan mountains and on rocky, secluded islands. They frequent regions in which they can readily find large prey, such as the mountains bounding the Ruined Kingdoms and the island of Afyal. A few, for whom pickings are slim, have been seen soaring over desert wastes and open expanses of ocean.</p>\n<p class=\"f\">In the Land of Fate, these birds have brilliant, multicolored plumage. Their wings and backs are typically a shade of green or gold, and females have snowy breasts. Their heavy, powerful beaks range from pale ivory to a rich shade of brass. The color of a roc's wing tips (the forward edge) distinguishes it from other species: crimson, common roc; azure, great roc; jet, two-headed roc. Males of each species have matching crests. Some adventurers claim to have seen rocs that are purely white, black, or red, but such creatures are so rare as to be legendary.</p>\n<p class=\"f\"> Size also distinguishes the species. The common roc, still magnificent, measures roughly 60 feet from its beak to the tip of its tail. It has a wingspan of about 120 feet. In contrast, the great roc measures up to 120 feet from beak to tail and has a wingspan of 270 feet. Except for its black-tipped wings, the rare two-headed roc is the same general size and color as the common roc. However, its two heads—characterized by an evil disposition and increased intelligence - are an obvious distinguishing feature.</p>\n<p class=\"f\"> Intelligent rocs speak their own language as well as Midani. In addition, they can communicate their wishes to lesser rocs (as in \"we wish you to leave the area immediately\").</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Combat:</b>The roc usually fights for two reasons: to feed or to protect its nest. If caught unaware and not hungry (a rare case), it uses its great speed to evade an equal or stronger opponent. Even on a full stomach, however, it may hold its ground and fight a pest who seems easy to destroy.</p><p class=\"f\">While hunting, rocs usually soar at a height of 300 to 500 feet, using their extremely sharp eyesight to spot prey on the ground. A roc's vision can penetrate ground fog, spray, dust storms, and shallow water. They can swoop down to seemingly \"appear out of nowhere\" and then disappear just as quickly, with little more than a gust of wind to mark their passage.</p>\n<p class=\"f\"> All roc species share this hunting tactic: (1) swoop and attack with claws; (2) seize prey in claws, attempting to pin arms if necessary (65 percent chance, prevents spellcasting); and (3) carry prey to nest, using bites as needed to subdue victim. Victims of a sudden swoop attack suffer a -5 penalty to their surprise rolls. If the roc must swoop at the same target more than once to seize it, the penalty does not apply. Damage and snaring success vary with the roc species:</p>\n<p class=\"f\"> A common or two-headed roc inflicts 3 to 18 (3d6) points of damage per claw. If both claws hit, the roc has a 95 percent chance to carry off its prey, which can be size Huge (up to 25 feet tall or long) or smaller.</p>\n<p class=\"f\"> A great roc inflicts 4 to 24 (4d6) points of damage per claw. If either claw hits a target that is size Large or smaller, the roc can carry it off automatically (if desired). If both claws strike a Gigantic creature, the great roc has a 95 percent chance of carrying it off.</p>\n<p class=\"f\"> If a seized victim attempts a counterattack, the bird will maintain its hold while punishing the quarry with bites (4d6 damage per strike). Regardless of its size, a roc won't release its prey until the roc suffers damage equaling 25 percent of its hit points (based on its total when combat began). Sufficient damage convinces the roc that the meal at hand isn't worth the effort. A morale check determines whether the roc flees.</p>\n<p class=\"f\"> Given a choice of two succulent or easy targets, rocs usually select the larger (a camel instead of its rider, for example). However, any roc can seize two different targets with its claws, provided the targets are within 10 feet of one another. The twoheaded roc can also attack two targets within 10 feet - choosing either two bite attacks or two claw attacks.</p>\n<p class=\"f\"> Given their intelligence, the great roc and two-headed roc may use rather sophisticated combat tactics. To prevent annoyances, for example, a great roc may scatter or destroy pesky shepherds before settling down to dine upon livestock.</p>\n<p class=\"f\"> The more intelligent species also use large boulders as \"nutcrackers,\" dropping the stones from the air to sink ships or demolish structures, exposing the \"softer meat\" inside. Such boulders inflict 3 to 30 (3d10) points of damage normally, and require ships, walls, and towers to make saving throws vs. crushing blow or be destroyed. A two-headed roc can make two boulder attacks per round.</p>\n<img src=\"/img/spc/roczakha1.gif\" width=\"300\" height=\"360\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Fiersome Zakharan Roc barring down a human victim one tenth its size.\" title=\"Roc, Zakharan\" style=\"float:left;\">\n<p class=\"f\"><b>Habitat/Society:</b>All roc species share a number of traits. They build their nests upon the tallest mountain, rocky outcrop, or perch in their territory, using branches and even whole trees in the construction. They are not social creatures. Each is highly territorial, especially against invasions by other rocs (excluding a suitable mate) and other large, flying creatures (such as the occasional dragon). A typical roc territory is a circle with a 10- mile radius, placing at least 20 miles between two nests.</p>\n<p class=\"f\">If a roc nest is found, there is a 15 percent chance that it contains either 1d4 +1 eggs or 1d4 +1 hatchlings. (Roll 1d100; 01-50 indicates eggs, and 51-00 indicates hatchlings.) Hatchlings are 4 HD each, but relatively helpless, with an AC of 10 and no attacks. Adults will fight to the death (morale of fearless, 18) to protect their eggs or young, gaining a +1 bonus to attacks. After six months in the nest, a roc has grown enough to leave it, and the roc gains the combat statistics of an adult.</p>\n<p class=\"f\"> All rocs feed at least three times daily: just after sunrise, at midday, and an hour before sunset. If there are young in the nest, there will be a midafternoon feeding flight as well. Heroes accustomed to being raised from the dead after mischances in the wilderness should beware: like many other birds, rocs partially digest their prey for their chicks, grinding it in a stone-filled gullet before they regurgitate it. While this has no effect on their chances of being raised, adventurers should plan on a long (and unpleasant) recovery period thereafter.</p>\n<p class=\"f\"> When dealing with humans or humanoids, great rocs tend to imperious, quickly becoming bored and hungry. Two-headed are more sly and (given their own evil bent) may be persuade aid in some villainy if the result will be a lot of dead herd animals.</p>\n<p class=\"f\"> Rocs do not value treasure except for its value as a shiny bauble. Male two-headed rocs build nests and festoon them with such treasure in hopes of attracting mates. A cheap but gleaming gem appeals to these males more than a dull but priceless ore. Common and great rocs have no such compulsion; they leave their riches strewn carelessly about their nests like trash. Most of their treasures are the inedible remains of pack animals-tack and harness, rugs, silks, tapestries, clothing, spices, perfume, caravan bells, and the occasional bar of metal or gemstone.</p>\n<p class=\"f\"><b>Ecology:</b> All rocs are difficult to raise, given their independent nature and huge appetites. Individual adventurers have been known to train roc chicks. Some sorcerers have ensnared rocs magically. According to legend, a tribe of jann near the World Pillars has even used rocs as mounts, but the story's veracity is questionable.</p>\n<p class=\"f\"> Rocs prey on the largest surmountable creatures they can find in their area. On land, they attack elephants, camels, purple worm ankhegs, and giants, and few rocs will pass up a light snack of undefended humans. At sea, they hunt like ospreys, snagging dolphins, elephant seals, and sharks from the water. The great rocs will even carry off kraken, giant squid, sea serpents, and whales, in addition to attacking ships. Even mated pairs of common rocs have been known to attack a sailing vessel or a dragon.</p>\n<p class=\"f\"> Roc eggs are valued as an exotic item or curiosity, and as a component for magical potions and oils. The egg of a common roc is the color of ivory. A great roc's stunning eggs are dappled with shades of turquoise and indigo, while a two-headed roc's are jet black. A merchant will pay 2d6 x 100 gp for the egg of an ordinary roc, twice that for the egg of a two-headed roc, and twice that again (2d6 x 400) for the egg of a great roc. Such eggs must be kept continually warm if they are to hatch, for the unborn chicks are sensitive to cold, and without the protection of their parent on the nest would soon perish. The inability to hatch does not diminish an egg's value as a curiosity, however.</p>\n","images":["<img src=\"grf/aq.gif\" width=\"150\" height=\"75\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Advanced Dungeons & Dragons 2nd Edition\" title=\"Al-Qadim (Forgotten Realms)\" align=\"right\">","<img src=\"/img/spc/roczakha1.gif\" width=\"300\" height=\"360\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Fiersome Zakharan Roc barring down a human victim one tenth its size.\" title=\"Roc, Zakharan\" style=\"float:left;\">"],"setting":"Al-Qadim (Forgotten Realms)","statblock":{"Common Roc":{"Activity Cycle":"Day","Alignment":"Neutral","Armor Class":"4","Climate/Terrain":"Semitropical/mountains/ocean","Damage/Attack":"3-18/3-18 or 4-24 (3d6/3d6 or 4d6)","Diet":"Omnivore","Frequency":"Rare","Hit Dice":"18","Intelligence":"Animal (1)","Magic Resistance":"Nil","Morale":"Steady (11)","Movement":"3, Fl 30 (C)","No. Appearing":"1-2","No. of Attacks":"2 claw or 1 bite","Organization":"Solitary","Size":"G (60 ft. long, 120.ft. wingspan)","Special Attacks":"Swoop with -5 to opponent's surprise; snare (95% chance or better)","Special Defenses":"Nil","THAC0":"5","Treasure":"C","XP Value":"12,000"},"Great Roc":{"Activity Cycle":"Day","Alignment":"Neutral","Armor Class":"2","Climate/Terrain":"Semitropical/mountains/ocean","Damage/Attack":"4-24/4-24 or 6-36 (4d6/4d6 or 6d6)","Diet":"Omnivore","Frequency":"Very rare","Hit Dice":"24","Intelligence":"Low (5-7)","Magic Resistance":"Nil","Morale":"Elite (13)","Movement":"3, Fl 24 (C)","No. Appearing":"1","No. of Attacks":"2 claw or 1 bite","Organization":"Solitary","Size":"G (120 ft. long, 270-ft. wingspan)","Special Attacks":"Boulder attack (3d10)","Special Defenses":"Nil","THAC0":"5","Treasure":"D","XP Value":"18,000"},"Two-headed Roc":{"Activity Cycle":"Day","Alignment":"Chaotic evil","Armor Class":"","Climate/Terrain":"Semitropical/mountains/ocean","Damage/Attack":"3-18/3-18 or 4-24/4-24 (3d6/3d6 or 4d6/4d6)","Diet":"Omnivore","Frequency":"Very rare","Hit Dice":"16","Intelligence":"Low (5-7)","Magic Resistance":"Nil","Morale":"Elite (13)","Movement":"34, FL 24 (C)","No. Appearing":"1-2","No. of Attacks":"2 claw or 1 bite","Organization":"Solitary","Size":"G (60 ft. long, 120.ft. wingspan)","Special Attacks":"Boulder attack (3d10/3d10)","Special Defenses":"Nil","THAC0":"5","Treasure":"D","XP Value":"14,000"}},"title":"Roc, Zakharan"},"sources":["1077"],"statblock_names":[],"title":"Roc, Zakharan","prev_key":"rockman","next_key":"roguhero","monster_path":"/appendix/roczakha"}},"staticQueryHashes":[],"slicesMap":{}}
