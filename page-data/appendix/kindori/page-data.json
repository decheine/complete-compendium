While the powers listed above are the most common, some aarakocra have different or additional powers.</p><p class=\"f\">A race of intelligent, birdlike creatures living in the deepest deserts of Athas, the rare Athasian <a href=\"/appendix/aarakocr\">aarakocra</a> spends its time soaring on thermals in search of food.</p><p>The aarakocra is 7 to 8 feet tall with a wingspan of 20 feet or more. Because of its large wingspan, an aarakocra can carry as much as 75% of its own body weight and still fly easily. An aarakocra can fly a short distance carrying a burden equaling 125% of its own body weight. The average body weight of a full grown male is 100 pounds and a female is 85 pounds.</p><p>Each wing has a &ldquo;hand&rdquo; at its midpoint, consisting of three fingers and an opposable thumb. The fourth finger forms the rigid leading edge of the wing. In flight the hands cannot be used, but on the ground the aarakocra can use its hands almost as a human would. The aarakocra's body is protected by a thin bony plate on the chest, much like a solid rib cage. Talons on its legs can be used as claws and can be retracted to reveal a second set of hands, also with three fingers and an opposable thumb. Except for the chest plate, the entire skeleton is hollow and extremely fragile.</p><p>From a distance, the Athasian aarakocra resembles a huge <a href=\"/appendix/bird\">vulture</a>. Its black eyes, set in the front of the head, provide excellent vision over a long range. The plumage is generally black with a white collar for adult males and black or brown with a smaller white collar for females. Adolescents are a mixture of brown and black. The beak is large and covers most of the head. Plumage begins at the crown of the head and is darker near the head, except for the collar. Athasian aarakocra speak their own language and the languages of vultures and other large birds. Some speak the common tongue (5% to 10% chance depending on how deep in the wastelands a tribe lives).</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Combat:</b> Aarakocra can fight in the air or on the ground. They prefer aerial combat since their bones are too fragile to withstand a solid blow from a human-sized opponent. In combat against creatures on the ground, they prefer to fly over their victim and drop weighted nets. Some aarakocra use darts to harass ground-based opponents.</p><p>If their opponents can fly, the aarakocra generally forgo the use of the net, although large groups sometimes use nets on flying creatures. Normally, aarakocra attack flying creatures with long spears, diving from above and allowing the momentum to carry the spear through the target. Such an attack doubles the damage if the aarakocra have been able to dive at least 50 feet. Only the very largest aarakocra can carry more than one of these spears, they can attack with both at once with no penalty, causing double damage on each strike. All diving attacks are made at +4 and should be treated as a charge attack. All other penalties and restrictions of charge attacks apply.</p><p>The effect of the aarakocra's nets depends on if the opponent is flying at the time it becomes entangled. Creatures on the ground that are hit by a net are entangled and unable to participate in any combat until they make a successful Strength check to get free of the net. Flying creatures hit by a net can no longer fly and immediately begin falling. If they cannot escape the net or use some magical means to arrest the fall, normal falling damage applies.</p><p>Unless victims are entangled in nets, aarakocra are cautious in ground combat. If the aarakocra outnumber their opponents they advance in a straight line and thrust with their spears. If outnumbered, or the opponents are particularly tough, the aarakocra withdraw. Victims entangled in nets are killed or incapacitated for use as food or ransom.</p><p>Athasian aarakocra are mindful of their physical limitations as well as their comparatively low psionic abilities. They do not normally initiate psionic combat. At the first sign of psionic powers from any of their victims, however, all aarakocra that have some ability will use whatever attack and defense modes they can in an attempt to destroy the threat. Large groups of is or more aarakocra may initiate psionic combat if their leaders feel they can win quickly and avoid physical combat.</p><p>In desperation, an aarakocra can attempt to bite an opponent in combat. Because of the unwieldiness of its beak, the aarakocra has a THAC0 of 18 if attacking with this appendage. Further, the birdman causes only 1d2 points of damage with the beak.</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Habitat/Society:</b> Athasian aarakocra live in tribes with 6-20 (2d8+4) members, depending on the prestige of the leader. The largest tribe ever recorded had 50 members. The tribal hunting territory depends on the size of the tribe, usually about 500 square miles for a tribe of 10 members. There are no rigid boundaries between tribes and border disputes are not uncommon.</p><p>Alignments of tribe members are similar to the alignment of the leader. A tribe that has a leader who is neutral good may have neutral good, chaotic good, lawful good, and true neutral members. A predominantly evil tribe does not recognize boundaries with other tribes and treats other tribes as inferior beings to be eliminated.</p><p>Athasian aarakocra aren't happy in enclosed spaces, but they they take refuge in a cave or building if necessary.</p><p>Nonevil tribes live in rocky aeries in the highest peaks they can find. Evil tribes are normally nomadic and use an aerie made by another tribe if they need to remain in an area for a long time, even if they have to evict the tribe that made the nest.</p><p>Aarakocra aren't friendly toward intruders in their territory, especially caravans. They try to extract a toll from the caravan for passage through the desert. Good-aligned tribes allow unhindered passage of caravans that pay a tribute. If someone refuses to pay the tribute, the aarakocra try to capture scouts or outriders from the party and hold them until an even larger tribute is paid. The payment may be either livestock or shiny objects. Aarakocra are smart enough not to be taken in by glass baubles instead of gems, although they cannot tell the difference between the more common gems and the rare ones.</p><p>Evil tribes ask for tribute and often attack a caravan whether it pays or not. Aarakocra always demand shiny objects such as stones. These tribes find humans and demihumans to be quite tasty and prefer them to other food.</p><p>Good-aligned tribes of aarakocra sometimes return a lost traveler to the edge of the desert after first removing any valuables the traveler may be carrying. On very rare occasions a tribe might return a lost group of travelers to the more frequently traveled parts of the desert, again after first taking any valuables as payment.</p><p>The oldest male is the leader of the tribal hunting party and has 4+4 Hit Dice. The oldest female is in charge of the tribal aerie and has 3+3 HD. In tribes that have more than 15 members, the next oldest aarakocra serves as shaman and has 3+3 HD; the shaman completes the triumvirate necessary for proper worship and the summoning of elementals. (Interestingly, no magic-using aarakocra has ever been recorded.) Tribes without a shaman cannot summon <a href=\"/appendix/element1\">air elementals</a>, which is an important part of aarakocra culture.</p><p>The shaman is the leader of the daily sun worship. Aarakocra worship the sun because it provides them with the thermals they need to soar in search of food. The shaman also leads the mystic rituals used to summon an air elemental. Summoning an air elemental is usually done only in preparation for the tribe's most sacred ceremony, the hunt. Small tribes must band together for this ceremony to allow the triumvirate to be formed.</p><p>The ceremony to summon an air elemental must be conducted at dawn and requires the oldest male and female to emit a highpitched keening whistle. The shaman conducts an intricate dance around them, simultaneously chanting an ancient summoning mantra.</p><p>The hunt is the final part of the initiation of adolescent aarakocra to adulthood and often takes the tribe far from their normal teritory. The target is always a <a href=\"/appendix/drakalsi\">silt drake</a>. The hunt is the only time the females leave the relative safety of the nest. Even an evil tribe will not interfere with a tribe on a hunt. An air elemental is often summoned to help find the drake, but never takes part in the actual combat. Although the adult members of the tribe take part in the initial phases of the combat, it is the initiates who deliver the final, killing blows to me drake. Scars from the hunt are considered a mark of pride among all aarakocra.</p><p>The females spend about eight months of the year incubating their eggs. Athasian aarakocra mate for life and a pair normally produces as many as 10 offspring. A female lays one egg a year. Constant incubation is not required because of the high daytime temperatures, so the females can maintain the nest and keep the tribe's treasure in order.</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Ecology:</b> Athasian aarakocra are high on the food chain and have no natural enemies other than <a href=\"/appendix/drakatha\">drakes</a>. Unless evil, aarakocra leave their own territory only to hunt the silt drake and return as soon as possible when the hunt is over. (Evil aarakocra attack others, as noted above.) Aarakocra eggs and hatchlings are sought after by wealthy land owners who wish to use the creatures as scouts and sentries. An egg can bring as much as 10 cp in Tyr's marketplace. Tribes that have had eggs or hatchlings stolen have long memories and sometimes take revenge against the thief at a later date. Captive aarakocra join any tribe they come in contact with.</p><p>Athasian aarakocra have a natural life span of 21-30 years.</p>\n","images":["<img src=\"grf/ds.gif\" width=\"150\" height=\"75\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Dark Sun\" title=\"Dark Sun\" align=\"right\">","<img src=\"img/aarakath.gif\" alt=\"Aarakocra (Athas)\" title=\"Aarakocra (Athas)\" border=\"0\" width=\"300\" height=\"360\" style=\"text-align:right;\" align=\"right\">","<img src=\"grf/add2_01.gif\" width=\"200\" height=\"56\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Advanced Dungeons & Dragons 2nd Edition\">"],"setting":"Dark Sun","statblock":{"Aarakocra (Athas)":{"Activity Cycle":"Day","Alignment":"Any","Armor Class":"7","Climate/Terrain":"Deep desert","Damage/Attack":"1d3/1d3 or by weapon","Diet":"Carnivore","Frequency":"Rare","Hit Dice":"2+2","Intelligence":"Average (8-10)","Magic Resistance":"Nil","Morale":"Steady (11)","Movement":"6, Fl 36 (C)","No. Appearing":"1d10","No. of Attacks":"2","Organization":"Tribal","Size":"M (20'+ wingspan)","Special Attacks":"Nil","Special Defenses":"Nil","THAC0":"17","Treasure":"Varies","XP Value":"65"}},"title":"Aarakocra (Athas)"},"sources":["2433"],"statblock_names":[],"title":"Aarakocra (Athas)","prev_key":"zygraat","next_key":"aarakocr","monster_path":"/appendix/aarakath"}}},"pageContext":{"monster_key":"kindori","monster_data":{"TSR":["1049"],"fullBody":"  <table cellspacing=\"0\" cellpadding=\"0\"><tr><th>Climate/Terrain:</th><td>Any space</td></tr><tr><th>Frequency:</th><td>Uncommon</td></tr><tr><th>Organization:</th><td>Pod</td></tr><tr><th>Activity Cycle:</th><td>Any</td></tr><tr><th>Diet:</th><td>Light</td></tr><tr><th>Intelligence:</th><td>Low (6)</td></tr><tr><th>Treasure:</th><td>Nil</td></tr><tr><th>Alignment:</th><td>Lawful neutral</td></tr><tr><th>No. Appearing:</th><td>2-8</td></tr><tr><th>Armor Class:</th><td>5</td></tr><tr><th>Movement:</th><td>18</td></tr><tr><th>Hit Dice:</th><td>20</td></tr><tr><th>THAC0:</th><td>3</td></tr><tr><th>No. of Attacks:</th><td>1 (tail)</td></tr><tr><th>Damage/Attack:</th><td>3-30</td></tr><tr><th>Special Attacks:</th><td>Blinding</td></tr><tr><th>Special Defenses:</th><td>Nil</td></tr><tr><th>Magic Resistance:</th><td>5%</td></tr><tr><th>Size:</th><td>G (80')</td></tr><tr><th>Morale:</th><td>Elite (13)</td></tr><tr><th>XP Value:</th><td>11,000</td></tr></table><p class=\"f\">Kindori are called <i>space whales</i>, and they are among the largest living creatures found in space. They resemble aquatic <a href=\"/appendix/whale\">whales</a> in general shape and are mammals as well. However, they lack any noticeable mouth, and the leading edge of their fishlike bodies is dotted with small eyes.</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Combat:</b> The kindori tend to be peaceful except when threatened. In normal conditions, this usually means a direct attack, but during herding periods (see below), any individual approaching the herd is seen as a danger.</p><p>The kindori's main physical weapon is its massive tail flukes, which it uses to batter its opponents. While kindori recognize the presence of humans, <a href=\"/appendix/beholde1\">beholders</a>, and other small creatures, they direct such attacks first and foremost against the ships that are a1most their size. The kindori work together to batter a single attacker to bits, then go to the next one. until all assailants are defeated.</p><p>The leading eyes of the kindori can emit a concentrated blast of light. This light is projected as a cone in the direction of the kindori's choice, with a 500-yard range and a base of 400 yards. All those within the cone must save vs. breath weapon or be blinded for 4-16 rounds. The kindori will use this form of attack against individuals they cannot beat, using the confusion it creates to escape.</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Habitat/Society:</b> The kindori travel in small groups, called pods, of 2-8 members. For large (7-8 member) pods, there will be a bull of maximum hit points present. This bull will be the forward line of defense if the pod is attacked.</p><p>Every so often (roughly annually, depending on the sphere), several pods will gather together into a larger herd of 3-30 members. There will be 3-6 bulls present in such a herd, and during this time, any ships that pass near the herds will be attacked. During herding the male kindori are particularly violent, engaging in tail-slapping contests with other young males (and often with ships that come too close). These tail-slappings create a pecking order within the herd, which in turn determines the mating rights of the various members. The oldest bulls always have first rights among the females, followed by the more powerful young.</p><p>The kindori young gestate for six months and are born live in space. A herd will be extremely protective during this time, since the young are prey to <a href=\"/appendix/scavver\">scavvers</a> and other attackers.</p><p>With these exceptions, kindori are generally peaceful and have been domesticated by a number of spaceborne barbarians. Such groups either travel short distances, such as within an asteroid belt, cluster, or ring; or are far-ranging space nomads making long voyages. The kindori is large enough to maintain its own gravity plane and air envelope, and has no need for air of its own.</p><p>The size of the kindori is such that mosses, molds, and other parasites nest on their large backs, which in turn brings other predators to clean them off. A kindori might (20% chance) have 3-18 gray or brown scavvers working over the growing population on their sides.</p><p>Some kindori that have been domesticated (see below) later go feral as their masters die or let them loose. These kindori sometimes have the ruins of old buildings (generally called howdahs) on their backs, along with more terrestrial plant and animal life. Such structures and life survive only on the back and sides of the kindori.</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Ecology:</b> A kindori does not eat as do most other creatures of space. It instead soaks in the rays of the sun, stars, and other shining bodies in its area of space. The &ldquo;belly&rdquo; of the kindori is dotted with tiny white patches, each of which sends energy deep within the creature, to be stored within its large mass.</p><p>Keeping this belly clean of parasites is a common act of herd be havior, as the great creatures rub each other to flake off old skin and parasites. They are less concerned with their backs, which is why small islands of life often spring up there.</p><p>An extremely old or sick kindori can be spotted by the overgrowth of vine and vegetation on it. Such creatures are near death, and often fall prey to the larger scavvers and other creatures.</p><p>Even in death kindori are powerful creatures, as their skeletons do not break up when parasites destroy their flesh. Undead creatures such as <a href=\"/appendix/lich\">liches</a> and <a href=\"/appendix/vampire\">vampires</a> often use skeletal kindori as their ships for slow, leisurely invasions of new lands (the undead have forever). Such dead kindori have 15 hull points, plus whatever modifications (weapons, etc) are made to them.</p><p>There have been stories of hitching a spelljamming helm to a kindori. It is generally agreed that the action of moving at spelljamming speeds spooks them, and even domesticated kindori will head off for parts unknown, seeking to scrape the irritating helm from their flesh. Some skeletal kindori have been fitted with such helms by undead marauders and used as warships.</p><p>The kindori have many natural enemies, including the <a href=\"/appendix/krajen\">krajen</a>, the <a href=\"/appendix/dragradi\">radiant dragons</a>, and the various humaniform races. Beholders and <a href=\"/appendix/mindflay\">mind flayers</a>, sensitive to the creature's light-emitting eyes, have a particular dislike of them. The former will avoid kindori whenever possible, while the latter will engage in wholesale slaughter of them, massing armadas to take out whole pods that lie too close to their outposts.</p><p>The flesh of the kindori can be rendered into oil, much like the aquatic whale, and it is this kindori flesh that is the source of most greek fire for various races. The <a href=\"/appendix/lizarman\">lizard men</a>, who use greek fire regularly, often put together whaling parties to hunt kindori, and are working on a mobile base, towed in pieces by multiple wasp-class ships, that can render the flesh of the creature in the field.</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Domesticated Kindori</b></p>  <p class=\"ni\">Savage races in space will often use the kindori for short-range travel, usually in the period before they gain enough savvy and trading goods to deal with the <a href=\"/appendix/arcane\">arcane</a> on a regular basis. The &ldquo;savage races&rdquo; vary from empires ruled by philosopher kings, to degenerate standard races, to savage marauders who will attack everything in sight.</p><p>The kindori can be domesticated, but the savage races will operate in them in pod or herd groups, and will not split the kindori family groups. Only old solitary bulls will be found on their own, and then usually on exploration duty.</p><p>The savage races (which can be human, dwarf, elf, gnome, or even halfling) do not cut into the flesh of the kindori, but rather secure buildings, weapon platforms, and the like with short hooks that lightly snag the thick hide of the beast. The savage races will often maintain farms and herd terrestrial beasts on the backs of such creatures, since the kindori have no need of the atmosphere around them.</p><p>A typical kindori/savage race group will number some 2-8 kindori, each with a crew of 10-20 warriors. Dress and weapons vary from place to place, from bone spears to bronze armor and short swords. There will be at most one light catapult per kindori, save for the bulls, which can carry heavy catapults. The crew arrangements will be an extension of the savage's native group, with a captain or shaman or chieftain leading the herd.</p><p>The savages will trade with spaceborne races (if they are peaceful), but do not like or trust spelljammer helms, which make their mounts mad.</p>\n","images":["<img src=\"grf/sj.gif\" width=\"150\" height=\"75\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Spelljammer\" title=\"Spelljammer\" align=\"right\">","<img src=\"img/kindori.gif\" alt=\"Kindori\" title=\"Kindori\" border=\"0\" width=\"300\" height=\"360\" style=\"text-align:right;\" align=\"right\">","<img src=\"grf/add2_01.gif\" width=\"200\" height=\"56\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Advanced Dungeons & Dragons 2nd Edition\">"],"setting":"Spelljammer","statblock":{"Kindori":{"Activity Cycle":"Any","Alignment":"Lawful neutral","Armor Class":"5","Climate/Terrain":"Any space","Damage/Attack":"3-30","Diet":"Light","Frequency":"Uncommon","Hit Dice":"20","Intelligence":"Low (6)","Magic Resistance":"5%","Morale":"Elite (13)","Movement":"18","No. Appearing":"2-8","No. of Attacks":"1 (tail)","Organization":"Pod","Size":"G (80')","Special Attacks":"Blinding","Special Defenses":"Nil","THAC0":"3","Treasure":"Nil","XP Value":"11,000"}},"title":"Kindori"},"sources":["1049"],"statblock_names":[],"title":"Kindori","prev_key":"killspru","next_key":"kirin","monster_path":"/appendix/kindori"}},"staticQueryHashes":[],"slicesMap":{}}
