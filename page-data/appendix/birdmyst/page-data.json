While the powers listed above are the most common, some aarakocra have different or additional powers.</p><p class=\"f\">A race of intelligent, birdlike creatures living in the deepest deserts of Athas, the rare Athasian <a href=\"/appendix/aarakocr\">aarakocra</a> spends its time soaring on thermals in search of food.</p><p>The aarakocra is 7 to 8 feet tall with a wingspan of 20 feet or more. Because of its large wingspan, an aarakocra can carry as much as 75% of its own body weight and still fly easily. An aarakocra can fly a short distance carrying a burden equaling 125% of its own body weight. The average body weight of a full grown male is 100 pounds and a female is 85 pounds.</p><p>Each wing has a &ldquo;hand&rdquo; at its midpoint, consisting of three fingers and an opposable thumb. The fourth finger forms the rigid leading edge of the wing. In flight the hands cannot be used, but on the ground the aarakocra can use its hands almost as a human would. The aarakocra's body is protected by a thin bony plate on the chest, much like a solid rib cage. Talons on its legs can be used as claws and can be retracted to reveal a second set of hands, also with three fingers and an opposable thumb. Except for the chest plate, the entire skeleton is hollow and extremely fragile.</p><p>From a distance, the Athasian aarakocra resembles a huge <a href=\"/appendix/bird\">vulture</a>. Its black eyes, set in the front of the head, provide excellent vision over a long range. The plumage is generally black with a white collar for adult males and black or brown with a smaller white collar for females. Adolescents are a mixture of brown and black. The beak is large and covers most of the head. Plumage begins at the crown of the head and is darker near the head, except for the collar. Athasian aarakocra speak their own language and the languages of vultures and other large birds. Some speak the common tongue (5% to 10% chance depending on how deep in the wastelands a tribe lives).</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Combat:</b> Aarakocra can fight in the air or on the ground. They prefer aerial combat since their bones are too fragile to withstand a solid blow from a human-sized opponent. In combat against creatures on the ground, they prefer to fly over their victim and drop weighted nets. Some aarakocra use darts to harass ground-based opponents.</p><p>If their opponents can fly, the aarakocra generally forgo the use of the net, although large groups sometimes use nets on flying creatures. Normally, aarakocra attack flying creatures with long spears, diving from above and allowing the momentum to carry the spear through the target. Such an attack doubles the damage if the aarakocra have been able to dive at least 50 feet. Only the very largest aarakocra can carry more than one of these spears, they can attack with both at once with no penalty, causing double damage on each strike. All diving attacks are made at +4 and should be treated as a charge attack. All other penalties and restrictions of charge attacks apply.</p><p>The effect of the aarakocra's nets depends on if the opponent is flying at the time it becomes entangled. Creatures on the ground that are hit by a net are entangled and unable to participate in any combat until they make a successful Strength check to get free of the net. Flying creatures hit by a net can no longer fly and immediately begin falling. If they cannot escape the net or use some magical means to arrest the fall, normal falling damage applies.</p><p>Unless victims are entangled in nets, aarakocra are cautious in ground combat. If the aarakocra outnumber their opponents they advance in a straight line and thrust with their spears. If outnumbered, or the opponents are particularly tough, the aarakocra withdraw. Victims entangled in nets are killed or incapacitated for use as food or ransom.</p><p>Athasian aarakocra are mindful of their physical limitations as well as their comparatively low psionic abilities. They do not normally initiate psionic combat. At the first sign of psionic powers from any of their victims, however, all aarakocra that have some ability will use whatever attack and defense modes they can in an attempt to destroy the threat. Large groups of is or more aarakocra may initiate psionic combat if their leaders feel they can win quickly and avoid physical combat.</p><p>In desperation, an aarakocra can attempt to bite an opponent in combat. Because of the unwieldiness of its beak, the aarakocra has a THAC0 of 18 if attacking with this appendage. Further, the birdman causes only 1d2 points of damage with the beak.</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Habitat/Society:</b> Athasian aarakocra live in tribes with 6-20 (2d8+4) members, depending on the prestige of the leader. The largest tribe ever recorded had 50 members. The tribal hunting territory depends on the size of the tribe, usually about 500 square miles for a tribe of 10 members. There are no rigid boundaries between tribes and border disputes are not uncommon.</p><p>Alignments of tribe members are similar to the alignment of the leader. A tribe that has a leader who is neutral good may have neutral good, chaotic good, lawful good, and true neutral members. A predominantly evil tribe does not recognize boundaries with other tribes and treats other tribes as inferior beings to be eliminated.</p><p>Athasian aarakocra aren't happy in enclosed spaces, but they they take refuge in a cave or building if necessary.</p><p>Nonevil tribes live in rocky aeries in the highest peaks they can find. Evil tribes are normally nomadic and use an aerie made by another tribe if they need to remain in an area for a long time, even if they have to evict the tribe that made the nest.</p><p>Aarakocra aren't friendly toward intruders in their territory, especially caravans. They try to extract a toll from the caravan for passage through the desert. Good-aligned tribes allow unhindered passage of caravans that pay a tribute. If someone refuses to pay the tribute, the aarakocra try to capture scouts or outriders from the party and hold them until an even larger tribute is paid. The payment may be either livestock or shiny objects. Aarakocra are smart enough not to be taken in by glass baubles instead of gems, although they cannot tell the difference between the more common gems and the rare ones.</p><p>Evil tribes ask for tribute and often attack a caravan whether it pays or not. Aarakocra always demand shiny objects such as stones. These tribes find humans and demihumans to be quite tasty and prefer them to other food.</p><p>Good-aligned tribes of aarakocra sometimes return a lost traveler to the edge of the desert after first removing any valuables the traveler may be carrying. On very rare occasions a tribe might return a lost group of travelers to the more frequently traveled parts of the desert, again after first taking any valuables as payment.</p><p>The oldest male is the leader of the tribal hunting party and has 4+4 Hit Dice. The oldest female is in charge of the tribal aerie and has 3+3 HD. In tribes that have more than 15 members, the next oldest aarakocra serves as shaman and has 3+3 HD; the shaman completes the triumvirate necessary for proper worship and the summoning of elementals. (Interestingly, no magic-using aarakocra has ever been recorded.) Tribes without a shaman cannot summon <a href=\"/appendix/element1\">air elementals</a>, which is an important part of aarakocra culture.</p><p>The shaman is the leader of the daily sun worship. Aarakocra worship the sun because it provides them with the thermals they need to soar in search of food. The shaman also leads the mystic rituals used to summon an air elemental. Summoning an air elemental is usually done only in preparation for the tribe's most sacred ceremony, the hunt. Small tribes must band together for this ceremony to allow the triumvirate to be formed.</p><p>The ceremony to summon an air elemental must be conducted at dawn and requires the oldest male and female to emit a highpitched keening whistle. The shaman conducts an intricate dance around them, simultaneously chanting an ancient summoning mantra.</p><p>The hunt is the final part of the initiation of adolescent aarakocra to adulthood and often takes the tribe far from their normal teritory. The target is always a <a href=\"/appendix/drakalsi\">silt drake</a>. The hunt is the only time the females leave the relative safety of the nest. Even an evil tribe will not interfere with a tribe on a hunt. An air elemental is often summoned to help find the drake, but never takes part in the actual combat. Although the adult members of the tribe take part in the initial phases of the combat, it is the initiates who deliver the final, killing blows to me drake. Scars from the hunt are considered a mark of pride among all aarakocra.</p><p>The females spend about eight months of the year incubating their eggs. Athasian aarakocra mate for life and a pair normally produces as many as 10 offspring. A female lays one egg a year. Constant incubation is not required because of the high daytime temperatures, so the females can maintain the nest and keep the tribe's treasure in order.</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Ecology:</b> Athasian aarakocra are high on the food chain and have no natural enemies other than <a href=\"/appendix/drakatha\">drakes</a>. Unless evil, aarakocra leave their own territory only to hunt the silt drake and return as soon as possible when the hunt is over. (Evil aarakocra attack others, as noted above.) Aarakocra eggs and hatchlings are sought after by wealthy land owners who wish to use the creatures as scouts and sentries. An egg can bring as much as 10 cp in Tyr's marketplace. Tribes that have had eggs or hatchlings stolen have long memories and sometimes take revenge against the thief at a later date. Captive aarakocra join any tribe they come in contact with.</p><p>Athasian aarakocra have a natural life span of 21-30 years.</p><p></p><br clear=\"all\" style=\"clear:both; height:0;\">\r\n","images":["<img src=\"grf/ds.gif\" width=\"150\" height=\"75\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Dark Sun\" title=\"Dark Sun\" align=\"right\">","<img src=\"img/aarakath.gif\" alt=\"Aarakocra (Athas)\" title=\"Aarakocra (Athas)\" border=\"0\" width=\"300\" height=\"360\" style=\"text-align:right;\" align=\"right\">","<img src=\"grf/add2_01.gif\" width=\"200\" height=\"56\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Advanced Dungeons & Dragons 2nd Edition\">"],"setting":"Dark Sun","statblock":{"Aarakocra (Athas)":{"Activity Cycle":"Day","Alignment":"Any","Armor Class":"7","Climate/Terrain":"Deep desert","Damage/Attack":"1d3/1d3 or by weapon","Diet":"Carnivore","Frequency":"Rare","Hit Dice":"2+2","Intelligence":"Average (8-10)","Magic Resistance":"Nil","Morale":"Steady (11)","Movement":"6, Fl 36 (C)","No. Appearing":"1d10","No. of Attacks":"2","Organization":"Tribal","Size":"M (20'+ wingspan)","Special Attacks":"Nil","Special Defenses":"Nil","THAC0":"17","Treasure":"Varies","XP Value":"65"}},"title":"Aarakocra (Athas)"},"sources":["2433"],"statblock_names":[],"title":"Aarakocra (Athas)","prev_key":"zygraat","next_key":"aarakocr","monster_path":"/appendix/aarakath"}}},"pageContext":{"monster_key":"birdmyst","monster_data":{"TSR":["2501"],"fullBody":"  <table cellspacing=\"0\" cellpadding=\"0\"><tr class=\"bk\"><th> </th><th class=\"cn\">Magpie<br>(common)</th><th class=\"cn\">Magpie<br>(giant)</th><th class=\"cn\">Piranhabird<br>(lesser)</th><th class=\"cn\">Piranhabird<br>(greater)</th><th class=\"cn\">Sprackle<br>(lesser)</th><th class=\"cn\">Sprackle<br>(greater)</th></tr><tr><th>Climate/Terrain:</th><td>Any temperate</td><td>Any temperate</td><td>Nonarctic forest</td><td>Nonarctic forest</td><td>Temperate mountains</td><td>Temperate mountains</td></tr><tr><th>Frequency:</th><td>Common</td><td>Rare</td><td>Rare</td><td>Very rare</td><td>Very rare</td><td>Very rare</td></tr><tr><th>Organization:</th><td>Solitary</td><td>Solitary</td><td>Flock</td><td>Flock</td><td>Rook</td><td>Rook</td></tr><tr><th>Activity Cycle:</th><td>Day</td><td>Day</td><td>Night</td><td>Night</td><td>Day</td><td>Day</td></tr><tr><th>Diet:</th><td>Insectivore</td><td>Insectivore</td><td>Carnivore</td><td>Carnivore</td><td>Insectivore</td><td>Carnivore</td></tr><tr><th>Intelligence:</th><td>Semi- (2)</td><td>Semi- (4)</td><td>Semi- (2)</td><td>Semi- (2)</td><td>Animal (1)</td><td>Semi- (2)</td></tr><tr><th>Treasure:</th><td>See below</td><td>See below</td><td>Nil</td><td>Nil</td><td>See below</td><td>See below</td></tr><tr><th>Alignment:</th><td>Neutral</td><td>Neutral</td><td>Chaotic neutral</td><td>Chaotic neutral</td><td>Neutral</td><td>Neutral</td></tr><tr><th>No. Appearing:</th><td>1d6</td><td>1d4</td><td>1d4 wings of 1d4+2 birds</td><td>2d6</td><td>2d6</td><td>2d6</td></tr><tr><th>Armor Class:</th><td>7</td><td>6</td><td>7</td><td>6</td><td>7</td><td>6</td></tr><tr><th>Movement:</th><td>1, Fl 36 (B)</td><td>3, Fl 33 (B)</td><td>Fl 36 (A)</td><td>Fl 36 (A)</td><td>1, Fl 36 (B)</td><td>3, Fl 36 (B)</td></tr><tr><th>Hit Dice:</th><td>1-2 hp</td><td>1+1</td><td>1-4 hp</td><td>2</td><td>1-4 hp</td><td>2</td></tr><tr><th>THAC0:</th><td>20</td><td>19</td><td>20</td><td>19</td><td>20</td><td>19</td></tr><tr><th>No. of Attacks:</th><td>1</td><td>1</td><td>1 (per wing)</td><td>1</td><td>1</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><th>Damage/Attack:</th><td>1 (beak)</td><td>1d4 (beak)</td><td>1d4 (bite)</td><td>1d6 (bite)</td><td>1d3 (beak)</td><td>1d6 (beak)</td></tr><tr><th>Special Attacks:</th><td>Nil</td><td>Nil</td><td>+2 to attacks</td><td>Blood frenzy</td><td>Electricity, armor penetration</td><td>Electricity, armor penetration</td></tr><tr><th>Special Defenses:</th><td>Nil</td><td>Nil</td><td>Nil</td><td>Nil</td><td>Electricity</td><td>Electricity</td></tr><tr><th>Magic Resistance:</th><td>Nil</td><td>Nil</td><td>Nil</td><td>Nil</td><td>Nil</td><td>Nil</td></tr><tr><th>Size:</th><td>T (2' long)</td><td>S-M (3-5' long)</td><td>T (1' long)</td><td>S (2&#189;' long)</td><td>T (2' long)</td><td>S (4' long)</td></tr><tr><th>Morale:</th><td>Unsteady (6)</td><td>Average (8)</td><td>Average (8)</td><td>Average (10)</td><td>Average (8)</td><td>Average (10)</td></tr><tr><th>XP Value:</th><td>15</td><td>65</td><td>15</td><td>65</td><td>65</td><td>175</td></tr></table><p class=\"f\">A wealth of <a href=\"/appendix/bird\">birds</a> inhabit the world of Mystara. This section offers a brief sampling, from the mundane but troublesome magpie to the electrifying sprackle.</p><h2><img src=\"/img/spc/magpie.gif\" width=\"150\" height=\"180\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Magpie\" style=\"float:right;\">Magpie</h2><p class=\"f\">Magpies are notorious for stealing bright objects. Two varieties make their home in Mystara: common and giant. The common magpie is 14 to 18 inches long from its head to the tip of its tail. The body and tail are mostly black (often shot with metallic blue, green and lavender), and the shoulders and belly are white. The giant magpie sports similar colors, but measures 3 to 5 feet from beak to tail.</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Combat:</b> Common magpies fight aggressively if provoked, causing 1 point of damace with each peck. Since they are able flyers, though, it is usually easy for them to escape danger.</p><p>The beak of the giant magpie inflicts 1d4 points of damage</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Habitat/Society:</b> Magpies have a well-deserved reputation as thieves, and may attempt to steal any shiny or brightly colored object that's unsecured. A common magpie can steal objects weighing up to 3 or 4 ounces (for example, a coin, gem or ring), while the giant magpie can manage objects up to 2 pounds (for example, a piece of jewehy, a dagger, a wand, or a potion bottle).</p><p>If people are nearby, a magpie may swoop down to take an object without landing, and has a 30% chance of picking it up cleanly and making off without dropping it. If the bird can land unseen, however, its overall chance of success increases to 60% Stolen objects are taken to the bird's nest.</p><p>Finding the nest in order to retrieve a lost item may be a difficult task, perhaps even perilous if the search leads to the territories of dangerous creatures. The search may also be rewarding, however, since the nest might also contain 1d6 coins (30%), 1d2 small gems (3%), a piece of jewelry/art object (3% - giant magpie only), or even a small magical item (1% - giant magpie only).</p><p>The magpie's nest is woven of sticks, straw, and mud. Magpies often weave thorny twigs into the roof of the nest to keep predators from attacking the abode. The nest is fairly large and round,with only one entrance. A typical clutch contains 5 to 6 greenish blue or yellowish eggs.</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Ecology:</b> Both common and giant magpies prefer to live in cool or temperate habitats, making their homes in woodlands, agricultural land, and even towns. Occansionally a magpie serves as a wizard's familiar.</p><p>Magpies eat insects and grain. Those dwelling in settled areas often make their nests near granaries, which offer plentiful meals of spilled grain.</p><p>According to folklore and common superstition, the number of magpies one sees at a time can help foretell the future. Seven magpies are a portent of great evil.</p><h2><img src=\"/img/spc/birdpira.gif\" width=\"360\" height=\"300\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Piranha Bird\" style=\"float:left;\">Piranha Bird</h2><p class=\"f\">This vicious creature gathers in flocks that rapidly tear apart prey, much like the <a href=\"/appendix/piranha\">fish</a> after which the piranha bird is named.</p><p>Both varietes of piranha bird (lesser and greater) are garishly colored. Individual birds may have green, blue, red, brown, black, or occasionally purple feathers - the entire spectrum of colors is usually displayed in a single flock.</p><p>Lesser piranha birds grow to a maximum of 1 foot long. Greater piranha birds, on the other hand, average over twice that length. The whistles of greater piranha birds are lower and more melodic than those of lesser piranha birds.</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Combat:</b> Piranha birds have gaping mouths full of slashing teeth. These are razor-sharp, so that the bird can easily bite into flesh and rip away a mouthful while on the wing.</p><p>These creatures can fly with hummingbirdlike maneuverability. They can make sudden changes in direction, or even hover in midair. When one catches sight of a potential meal, it utters a high-pitched whistle, alerting the whole flock. These birds only attack warm-blooded creatures.</p><p>Lesser piranha birds attack in groups. A flock divides itself into one or more &ldquo;attack wings&rdquo; of 3 to 6 individuals (1d4+2). Each &ldquo;wing&rdquo; attacks as though it were a single monster, attacking with a +2 bonus and inflicting 1d4 points of damage per hit. If a flock is reduced to fewer than three piranha birds, they lose their attack bonus and must make a successful morale check or scatter.</p><p>The greater piranha birds, on the other hand, attack individually, each bite inflicting 1d6 points of damage. If half of their flock has been killed or incapacitated, they must pass a morale check or flee. If they pass, they go into a blood frenzy that gives them a +2 to all attacks.</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Habitat/Society:</b> Piranha birds do not like bright sunlight, but may he found in warm climates, except areas barren of any shade. They live in regions of dense forest. Underground varieties have developed limited infravision (up to 30 feet). At night or on overcast or foggy days, piranha birds may fly far from their nests in search of prey.</p><p>Piranha birds reproduce every spring. Each female lays 2 to 5 eggs. She warms them until hatching, and then rejoins the hunt to feed the young. Piranha birds are especially voracious at this time - first the males, which must bring hack enough food to the nests to feed the females; then male and female alike, as they strive to feed their offspring.</p><p>A flock of piranha birds has no leader as such, hut does have a pecking order that dictates which bird gets first pick of fallen prey for itself, its mate and its young.</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Ecology:</b> Piranha birds, both lesser and greater, are always hungry for fresh meat. They have no interest in treasure; in fact, they tend to avoid shiny objects.</p><h2>Sprackle</h2><p class=\"f\">These creatures look verv similar to grackles, the common blackbirds from which they are descended. However, sprackles are larger and colored differently: Their feathers are coppery or reddish-brown. Moreover, these birds constantly shed little electrical sparks that make them glow in the dark. Their name is a blend of the words &ldquo;spark&rdquo; and &ldquo;grackle&rdquo;.</p><p>There are two varieties of sprackle: lesser and greater. The difference between them is simply one of size. The lesser sprackle averages 20 inches in length, while the greater sprackle grows as long as 4 feet.</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Combat:</b> The sprackles' beaks are very long and sharp and can penetrate armor, giving them a +2 attack bonus against foes in plate mail (bronze or normal), ring mail, or chain mail. Further, sprackles can launch lightning attacks at creatures within 30 feet (60 feet for the greater sprackle); a small charge of electricity shoots out from their beaks and, with a successful attack roll, causes 1d3 points of damage (1d6 for the greater sprackle).</p><p>An electrical charge constantly surrounds a sprackle. Even if not directed as a lightning blast, it still inflicts 1d3 (or 1d6 for greater sprackles) points of damage upon any creature that comes into contact with it. Conductive materials (such as metal swords) also carry damage to a wielder.</p><p>Sprackles fly directly toward their prey in combat, shooting their lightning blasts until they get within melee range. At that point they attack with their beaks (1d3 or 1d6 damage from the sharp beak, plus 1d3 or 1d6 electrical damage). They continue to fight until half the flock is killed or wounded, at which time they must pass a morale check or flee.</p><p>All sprackles have infravision with a range of 60 feet.</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Habitat/Society:</b> Sprackles are very territorial and will fearlessly attack creatures larger than themselves. They avoid undead creatures and those larger than man-sized, but will attack other creatures to drive them out of their territory.</p><p>Sprackles first appeared in a place called Corran Keep, in the mountains of Mystara. Powerful magic there seems to have transformed ordinary birds into these creatures. Since their creation, sprackles have been spreading rapidly, aggressively pushing more common predatory birds out of their temtories.</p><p>Sprackles may he most commonly encountered on the forested lower slopes of mountains. As the species spreads, however, they may soon he found in many other areas.</p><p>A group of Sprackles is called a rook. They gather in extended families of two to a dozen birds, which share a large, communal nesting area (called a rookery). Rookeries are located in sheltered areas, such as the eaves of an abandoned building or under a rocky overhang. They are built of sticks and mud, and lined with downy feathers shed by the birds.</p><p>Like magpies, sprackles are attracted to shiny objects which may he valuable. Their nests might contain 2d6 coins (30%), 1d4 small gems (5%, 30% - giant sprackle), a piece of jewelry/art object (5% - giant sprackle only), or even a small magical item (2%-giant sprackle only). Also, their treasure reflects the chance that they dwell in a ruin or similar place that may contain abandoned valuables.</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Ecology:</b> Because of their sparks, sprackles do most of their hunting in the daytime, when they are slightly less obvious. (Glowing predators have a tendency to frighten off their prey.)</p><p>Lesser sprackles are insectivores, preying chiefly on larger insects and arthropods such as butterflies, <a href=\"/appendix/centiped\">centipedes</a>, moths, <a href=\"/appendix/spider\">spiders</a>, and <a href=\"/appendix/drgnfly\">dragonflies</a>. Greater sprackles are carnivores who more frequently dine on mice, <a href=\"/appendix/rat\">rats</a>, smaller birds, and sometimes <a href=\"/appendix/insect\">giant insects</a>, such as <a href=\"/appendix/drgnflgi\">giant dragonflies</a>, robber flies, and giant centipedes and spiders.</p><p></p><br clear=\"all\" style=\"clear:both; height:0;\">\r\n","images":["<img src=\"grf/ms.gif\" width=\"150\" height=\"75\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Mystara\" title=\"Mystara\" align=\"right\">","<img src=\"/img/spc/magpie.gif\" width=\"150\" height=\"180\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Magpie\" style=\"float:right;\">","<img src=\"/img/spc/birdpira.gif\" width=\"360\" height=\"300\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Piranha Bird\" style=\"float:left;\">","<img src=\"grf/add2_01.gif\" width=\"200\" height=\"56\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Advanced Dungeons & Dragons 2nd Edition\">"],"setting":"Mystara","statblock":{"Magpie<br>(common)":{"Activity Cycle":"Day","Alignment":"Neutral","Armor Class":"7","Climate/Terrain":"Any temperate","Damage/Attack":"1 (beak)","Diet":"Insectivore","Frequency":"Common","Hit Dice":"1-2 hp","Intelligence":"Semi- (2)","Magic Resistance":"Nil","Morale":"Unsteady (6)","Movement":"1, Fl 36 (B)","No. Appearing":"1d6","No. of Attacks":"1","Organization":"Solitary","Size":"T (2' long)","Special Attacks":"Nil","Special Defenses":"Nil","THAC0":"20","Treasure":"See below","XP Value":"15"},"Magpie<br>(giant)":{"Activity Cycle":"Day","Alignment":"Neutral","Armor Class":"6","Climate/Terrain":"Any temperate","Damage/Attack":"1d4 (beak)","Diet":"Insectivore","Frequency":"Rare","Hit Dice":"1+1","Intelligence":"Semi- (4)","Magic Resistance":"Nil","Morale":"Average (8)","Movement":"3, Fl 33 (B)","No. Appearing":"1d4","No. of Attacks":"1","Organization":"Solitary","Size":"S-M (3-5' long)","Special Attacks":"Nil","Special Defenses":"Nil","THAC0":"19","Treasure":"See below","XP Value":"65"},"Piranhabird<br>(greater)":{"Activity Cycle":"Night","Alignment":"Chaotic neutral","Armor Class":"6","Climate/Terrain":"Nonarctic forest","Damage/Attack":"1d6 (bite)","Diet":"Carnivore","Frequency":"Very rare","Hit Dice":"2","Intelligence":"Semi- (2)","Magic Resistance":"Nil","Morale":"Average (10)","Movement":"Fl 36 (A)","No. Appearing":"2d6","No. of Attacks":"1","Organization":"Flock","Size":"S (2&#189;' long)","Special Attacks":"Blood frenzy","Special Defenses":"Nil","THAC0":"19","Treasure":"Nil","XP Value":"65"},"Piranhabird<br>(lesser)":{"Activity Cycle":"Night","Alignment":"Chaotic neutral","Armor Class":"7","Climate/Terrain":"Nonarctic forest","Damage/Attack":"1d4 (bite)","Diet":"Carnivore","Frequency":"Rare","Hit Dice":"1-4 hp","Intelligence":"Semi- (2)","Magic Resistance":"Nil","Morale":"Average (8)","Movement":"Fl 36 (A)","No. Appearing":"1d4 wings of 1d4+2 birds","No. of Attacks":"1 (per wing)","Organization":"Flock","Size":"T (1' long)","Special Attacks":"+2 to attacks","Special Defenses":"Nil","THAC0":"20","Treasure":"Nil","XP Value":"15"},"Sprackle<br>(greater)":{"Activity Cycle":"Day","Alignment":"Neutral","Armor Class":"6","Climate/Terrain":"Temperate mountains","Damage/Attack":"1d6 (beak)","Diet":"Carnivore","Frequency":"Very rare","Hit Dice":"2","Intelligence":"Semi- (2)","Magic Resistance":"Nil","Morale":"Average (10)","Movement":"3, Fl 36 (B)","No. Appearing":"2d6","No. of Attacks":"1","Organization":"Rook","Size":"S (4' long)","Special Attacks":"Electricity, armor penetration","Special Defenses":"Electricity","THAC0":"19","Treasure":"See below","XP Value":"175"},"Sprackle<br>(lesser)":{"Activity Cycle":"Day","Alignment":"Neutral","Armor Class":"7","Climate/Terrain":"Temperate mountains","Damage/Attack":"1d3 (beak)","Diet":"Insectivore","Frequency":"Very rare","Hit Dice":"1-4 hp","Intelligence":"Animal (1)","Magic Resistance":"Nil","Morale":"Average (8)","Movement":"1, Fl 36 (B)","No. Appearing":"2d6","No. of Attacks":"1","Organization":"Rook","Size":"T (2' long)","Special Attacks":"Electricity, armor penetration","Special Defenses":"Electricity","THAC0":"20","Treasure":"See below","XP Value":"65"}},"title":"Bird (Mystara)"},"sources":["2501"],"statblock_names":[],"title":"Bird (Mystara)","prev_key":"birdkryn","next_key":"birdpias","monster_path":"/appendix/birdmyst"}},"staticQueryHashes":[],"slicesMap":{}}
