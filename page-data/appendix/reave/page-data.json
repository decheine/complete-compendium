While the powers listed above are the most common, some aarakocra have different or additional powers.</p><p class=\"f\">A race of intelligent, birdlike creatures living in the deepest deserts of Athas, the rare Athasian <a href=\"/appendix/aarakocr\">aarakocra</a> spends its time soaring on thermals in search of food.</p><p>The aarakocra is 7 to 8 feet tall with a wingspan of 20 feet or more. Because of its large wingspan, an aarakocra can carry as much as 75% of its own body weight and still fly easily. An aarakocra can fly a short distance carrying a burden equaling 125% of its own body weight. The average body weight of a full grown male is 100 pounds and a female is 85 pounds.</p><p>Each wing has a &ldquo;hand&rdquo; at its midpoint, consisting of three fingers and an opposable thumb. The fourth finger forms the rigid leading edge of the wing. In flight the hands cannot be used, but on the ground the aarakocra can use its hands almost as a human would. The aarakocra's body is protected by a thin bony plate on the chest, much like a solid rib cage. Talons on its legs can be used as claws and can be retracted to reveal a second set of hands, also with three fingers and an opposable thumb. Except for the chest plate, the entire skeleton is hollow and extremely fragile.</p><p>From a distance, the Athasian aarakocra resembles a huge <a href=\"/appendix/bird\">vulture</a>. Its black eyes, set in the front of the head, provide excellent vision over a long range. The plumage is generally black with a white collar for adult males and black or brown with a smaller white collar for females. Adolescents are a mixture of brown and black. The beak is large and covers most of the head. Plumage begins at the crown of the head and is darker near the head, except for the collar. Athasian aarakocra speak their own language and the languages of vultures and other large birds. Some speak the common tongue (5% to 10% chance depending on how deep in the wastelands a tribe lives).</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Combat:</b> Aarakocra can fight in the air or on the ground. They prefer aerial combat since their bones are too fragile to withstand a solid blow from a human-sized opponent. In combat against creatures on the ground, they prefer to fly over their victim and drop weighted nets. Some aarakocra use darts to harass ground-based opponents.</p><p>If their opponents can fly, the aarakocra generally forgo the use of the net, although large groups sometimes use nets on flying creatures. Normally, aarakocra attack flying creatures with long spears, diving from above and allowing the momentum to carry the spear through the target. Such an attack doubles the damage if the aarakocra have been able to dive at least 50 feet. Only the very largest aarakocra can carry more than one of these spears, they can attack with both at once with no penalty, causing double damage on each strike. All diving attacks are made at +4 and should be treated as a charge attack. All other penalties and restrictions of charge attacks apply.</p><p>The effect of the aarakocra's nets depends on if the opponent is flying at the time it becomes entangled. Creatures on the ground that are hit by a net are entangled and unable to participate in any combat until they make a successful Strength check to get free of the net. Flying creatures hit by a net can no longer fly and immediately begin falling. If they cannot escape the net or use some magical means to arrest the fall, normal falling damage applies.</p><p>Unless victims are entangled in nets, aarakocra are cautious in ground combat. If the aarakocra outnumber their opponents they advance in a straight line and thrust with their spears. If outnumbered, or the opponents are particularly tough, the aarakocra withdraw. Victims entangled in nets are killed or incapacitated for use as food or ransom.</p><p>Athasian aarakocra are mindful of their physical limitations as well as their comparatively low psionic abilities. They do not normally initiate psionic combat. At the first sign of psionic powers from any of their victims, however, all aarakocra that have some ability will use whatever attack and defense modes they can in an attempt to destroy the threat. Large groups of is or more aarakocra may initiate psionic combat if their leaders feel they can win quickly and avoid physical combat.</p><p>In desperation, an aarakocra can attempt to bite an opponent in combat. Because of the unwieldiness of its beak, the aarakocra has a THAC0 of 18 if attacking with this appendage. Further, the birdman causes only 1d2 points of damage with the beak.</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Habitat/Society:</b> Athasian aarakocra live in tribes with 6-20 (2d8+4) members, depending on the prestige of the leader. The largest tribe ever recorded had 50 members. The tribal hunting territory depends on the size of the tribe, usually about 500 square miles for a tribe of 10 members. There are no rigid boundaries between tribes and border disputes are not uncommon.</p><p>Alignments of tribe members are similar to the alignment of the leader. A tribe that has a leader who is neutral good may have neutral good, chaotic good, lawful good, and true neutral members. A predominantly evil tribe does not recognize boundaries with other tribes and treats other tribes as inferior beings to be eliminated.</p><p>Athasian aarakocra aren't happy in enclosed spaces, but they they take refuge in a cave or building if necessary.</p><p>Nonevil tribes live in rocky aeries in the highest peaks they can find. Evil tribes are normally nomadic and use an aerie made by another tribe if they need to remain in an area for a long time, even if they have to evict the tribe that made the nest.</p><p>Aarakocra aren't friendly toward intruders in their territory, especially caravans. They try to extract a toll from the caravan for passage through the desert. Good-aligned tribes allow unhindered passage of caravans that pay a tribute. If someone refuses to pay the tribute, the aarakocra try to capture scouts or outriders from the party and hold them until an even larger tribute is paid. The payment may be either livestock or shiny objects. Aarakocra are smart enough not to be taken in by glass baubles instead of gems, although they cannot tell the difference between the more common gems and the rare ones.</p><p>Evil tribes ask for tribute and often attack a caravan whether it pays or not. Aarakocra always demand shiny objects such as stones. These tribes find humans and demihumans to be quite tasty and prefer them to other food.</p><p>Good-aligned tribes of aarakocra sometimes return a lost traveler to the edge of the desert after first removing any valuables the traveler may be carrying. On very rare occasions a tribe might return a lost group of travelers to the more frequently traveled parts of the desert, again after first taking any valuables as payment.</p><p>The oldest male is the leader of the tribal hunting party and has 4+4 Hit Dice. The oldest female is in charge of the tribal aerie and has 3+3 HD. In tribes that have more than 15 members, the next oldest aarakocra serves as shaman and has 3+3 HD; the shaman completes the triumvirate necessary for proper worship and the summoning of elementals. (Interestingly, no magic-using aarakocra has ever been recorded.) Tribes without a shaman cannot summon <a href=\"/appendix/element1\">air elementals</a>, which is an important part of aarakocra culture.</p><p>The shaman is the leader of the daily sun worship. Aarakocra worship the sun because it provides them with the thermals they need to soar in search of food. The shaman also leads the mystic rituals used to summon an air elemental. Summoning an air elemental is usually done only in preparation for the tribe's most sacred ceremony, the hunt. Small tribes must band together for this ceremony to allow the triumvirate to be formed.</p><p>The ceremony to summon an air elemental must be conducted at dawn and requires the oldest male and female to emit a highpitched keening whistle. The shaman conducts an intricate dance around them, simultaneously chanting an ancient summoning mantra.</p><p>The hunt is the final part of the initiation of adolescent aarakocra to adulthood and often takes the tribe far from their normal teritory. The target is always a <a href=\"/appendix/drakalsi\">silt drake</a>. The hunt is the only time the females leave the relative safety of the nest. Even an evil tribe will not interfere with a tribe on a hunt. An air elemental is often summoned to help find the drake, but never takes part in the actual combat. Although the adult members of the tribe take part in the initial phases of the combat, it is the initiates who deliver the final, killing blows to me drake. Scars from the hunt are considered a mark of pride among all aarakocra.</p><p>The females spend about eight months of the year incubating their eggs. Athasian aarakocra mate for life and a pair normally produces as many as 10 offspring. A female lays one egg a year. Constant incubation is not required because of the high daytime temperatures, so the females can maintain the nest and keep the tribe's treasure in order.</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Ecology:</b> Athasian aarakocra are high on the food chain and have no natural enemies other than <a href=\"/appendix/drakatha\">drakes</a>. Unless evil, aarakocra leave their own territory only to hunt the silt drake and return as soon as possible when the hunt is over. (Evil aarakocra attack others, as noted above.) Aarakocra eggs and hatchlings are sought after by wealthy land owners who wish to use the creatures as scouts and sentries. An egg can bring as much as 10 cp in Tyr's marketplace. Tribes that have had eggs or hatchlings stolen have long memories and sometimes take revenge against the thief at a later date. Captive aarakocra join any tribe they come in contact with.</p><p>Athasian aarakocra have a natural life span of 21-30 years.</p><br clear=\"all\" style=\"clear:both; height:0;\">\r\n","images":["<img src=\"grf/ds.gif\" width=\"150\" height=\"75\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Dark Sun\" title=\"Dark Sun\" align=\"right\">","<img src=\"img/aarakath.gif\" alt=\"Aarakocra (Athas)\" title=\"Aarakocra (Athas)\" border=\"0\" width=\"300\" height=\"360\" style=\"text-align:right;\" align=\"right\">","<img src=\"grf/add2_01.gif\" width=\"200\" height=\"56\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Advanced Dungeons & Dragons 2nd Edition\">"],"setting":"Dark Sun","statblock":{"Aarakocra (Athas)":{"Activity Cycle":"Day","Alignment":"Any","Armor Class":"7","Climate/Terrain":"Deep desert","Damage/Attack":"1d3/1d3 or by weapon","Diet":"Carnivore","Frequency":"Rare","Hit Dice":"2+2","Intelligence":"Average (8-10)","Magic Resistance":"Nil","Morale":"Steady (11)","Movement":"6, Fl 36 (C)","No. Appearing":"1d10","No. of Attacks":"2","Organization":"Tribal","Size":"M (20'+ wingspan)","Special Attacks":"Nil","Special Defenses":"Nil","THAC0":"17","Treasure":"Varies","XP Value":"65"}},"title":"Aarakocra (Athas)"},"sources":["2433"],"statblock_names":[],"title":"Aarakocra (Athas)","prev_key":"zygraat","next_key":"aarakocr","monster_path":"/appendix/aarakath"}}},"pageContext":{"monster_key":"reave","monster_data":{"TSR":["2613"],"fullBody":"  <table cellspacing=\"0\" cellpadding=\"0\"><tr><th>Climate/Terrain:</th><td>Any</td></tr><tr><th>Frequency:</th><td>Uncommon</td></tr><tr><th>Organization:</th><td>Band</td></tr><tr><th>Activity Cycle:</th><td>Carnivore</td></tr><tr><th>Diet:</th><td>Average (8-10)</td></tr><tr><th>Intelligence:</th><td>B, individuals J,K,M</td></tr><tr><th>Treasure:</th><td>Lawful evil</td></tr><tr><th>Alignment:</th><td>Day</td></tr><tr><th>No. Appearing:</th><td>3-24</td></tr><tr><th>Armor Class:</th><td>3 (8)</td></tr><tr><th>Movement:</th><td>9</td></tr><tr><th>Hit Dice:</th><td>2+4</td></tr><tr><th>THAC0:</th><td>19</td></tr><tr><th>No. of Attacks:</th><td>2</td></tr><tr><th>Damage/Attack:</th><td>By weapon +2</td></tr><tr><th>Special Attacks:</th><td>None</td></tr><tr><th>Special Defenses:</th><td>Fading</td></tr><tr><th>Magic Resistance:</th><td>None</td></tr><tr><th>Size:</th><td>M (6-7' tall]</td></tr><tr><th>Morale:</th><td>Steady (11-12)</td></tr><tr><th>XP Value:</th><td>175</td></tr></table><p class=\"f\">The reaves are a race of violent marauders and plunderers who live for battle and pillage. They've been wandering the planes for centuries now, preying on the weak and defenseless wherever they find them. Bands of reaves like to hire on with any blood who has the jink for their services, as long as the job involves leg-breaking, arson, and general mayhem. When a reave can't call himself a mercenary, he'll &ldquo;freelance&rdquo; for a living until he finds &ldquo;employment&rdquo; again. Since there's always a basher who needs some extra muscle, reaves're fairly common anywhere there's a need for enforcers or professional highwaymen and brigands.</p><p>Reaves're true planewalkers, like fiends or <a href=\"/appendix/aasideva\">devas</a>. They can travel to the Astral by willing themselves there, and enter the top layer of any plane the Astral touches. This means that they're capable of hit-and-run tactics that most of their enemies can't respond to. Especially brazen reaves've even raided into Mount Celestia, Bytopia, and Arcadia, retreating to the Astral before the defenders of these planes muster their response. This natural ability makes reaves valuable to anyone who needs violence done in another plane.</p><p>The chant is the reaves're natives of Acheron, but this isn't strictly true. A thousand years ago or more, a great general brought 100.000 reave warriors to one of Acheron's wars from some unknown prime-material world. The First-comers were largely exterminated in the genocidal war, but enough survived to prosper and continue their race. It didn't take the reaves long to figure out that Acheron's opportunities were limited, and bands of reaves've been setting out from there to find their fortune elsewhere ever since.</p><p>Reaves are large, powerful humanoids equal in size to a mighty human warrior. They've got four arms, hut the secondary arms are behind the primary ones, not below them like an insect's extra limbs. Reaves aren't covered in skin, hut instead have a leathery, pebbled hide that gives them a natural AC of 8. However, they favor suits of garishly-decorated plate mail with flaring shoulder-plates and long chain skirts.</p><p>Reaves normally conceal their features beneath their helms, but if they're encountered without their armor they almost always wear great dark cloaks with heavy cowls over their faces. They have a powerful aversion to revealing their faces to any other creatures, including other reaves. Should a basher happen to see a reave's face, the reave'll make it a lifequest to find that basher and kill him. The reave's face is generally humanoid in appearance, but with four eyes spaced evenly across the front of its head and a series of convoluted, bony ridges in place of hair.</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Combat:</b> Reaves can use all of their arms as well as a human'd use his or her primary arm. Typically, a reave wields two weapons. If the weapons require only one hand each to use, the reave carries a pair of shields in his off-hands, improving his Armor Class to 1. A reave's arrangement of arms doesn't accommodate archery, so most prefer melee weapons. A group of reaves is normally equipped as shown below:</p><p>l 30%: Two polearms|25%: Two broad swords and two shields|15%: Two two-handed swords|20%: Javelin, short sword, and two shields|10%: Two morning stars, flails, or maces and two shields</p><p>A reave's powerfully muscled, and receives a +2 damage bonus to his attacks with band-held weapons. His odd symmetry permits a reave to attack foes on his flank as easily as a human'd attack someone in front of him, and turns any rear attacks into flank attacks. He receives a +1 bonus to surprise checks due to his increased range of vision.</p><p>Reaves've developed an unusual ability called fading, which they use to stack the odds in their favor during a fight. Basically, the reave becomes astral in order to surprise or escape his enemies. This ability works only when the reave can reach the Astral Plane - in other words, in the topmost layer of any of the Outer Planes, but not in the deeper layers. By fading, the reave can leave his current plane and return 1 to 6 rounds later to any chosen point within 100 yards of the place he left. The reave remains aware of what's happening on the plane he's fading away from, and doesn't have to come hack if he doesn't want to.</p><p>Fading takes two full rounds (besides the 1d6 rounds spent elsewhere): one to leave, and one to rematerialize. During this time, the reave can he damaged only by magic or enchanted weapons, since he's partially astral.</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Habitat/Society:</b> A band of reaves is organized along semi-military lines, with a clear chain of command and iron discipline within their own ranks. The most powerful male is the band's war-leader; he's the cutter responsible for commanding the reaves in battle and maintaining discipline. The most powerful female is the band's guide. She decides who they'll serve and under what kind of cohtract, and if they've got no employer, she decides where they'll raid next and when they'll move on.</p><p>Reaves can be extraordinarily violent bashers, but their violence is controlled by a strong commitment to their war-band and a sacred respect for their word. Once a reave's sworn to something, he'll never break his oath, no matter what the cost may be. 'Course, he'll seek any loophole possible and turn stag given half a chance, but as long as his word's bound him, he'll stick to it.</p><p>Between their sense of duty and love of battle, the reaves've evolved a complicated system of ritual challenge and honor. They're always on the lookout for possible insults, slights, or missteps on the part of any bashers around them, and they're quick to answer any slight, real or imagined. This also means that a cutter who knows the dark of the reaves' code can deal with an entire band of the creatures at once by challenging the band's champion or war leader and fighting one battle instead of dozens. He'll want to be real peery of how he words the challenge, though - wouldn't want to invite more trouble than he's already in for by giving them more fuel for their fire, imaginary or otherwise.</p><p>When a reave's free-lancing or between jobs, he's most dangerous, since he'll start a war if he can't find one that's already going. When they've got an assignment, reaves can be touchy, but they keep a tighter handle on their natural bloodthirst. It's not uncommon to find a handful of reave bodyguards having a drink in some Lower Ward alehouse, minding their own business and not trying to kill anyone. A cutter'd better be on his guard around those same reaves when he meets 'em in a lonely place on the Outlands, however.</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Ecology:</b> Reaves like red meat and lots of it. They're carnivores through and through, and sneer at anything that doesn't care for a bloody hunk of fresh meat. Like some other predators, reaves follow a cycle of gorging themselves and then fasting for days or weeks. This makes it possible for a band of reaves to move quickly, carrying few supplies.</p><p>On Acheron, their &ldquo;native&rdquo; plane, reaves can be found serving in the warring armies as mercenary contingents. Life'sexciting bur short there, so more and more reaves're leaving to try their luck elsewhere on the Great Wheel.</p><br clear=\"all\" style=\"clear:both; height:0;\">\r\n","images":["<img src=\"grf/ps.gif\" width=\"150\" height=\"75\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Planescape\" title=\"Planescape\" align=\"right\">","<img src=\"img/reave.gif\" alt=\"Reave\" title=\"Reave\" border=\"0\" width=\"300\" height=\"360\" style=\"text-align:right;\" align=\"right\">","<img src=\"grf/add2_01.gif\" width=\"200\" height=\"56\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Advanced Dungeons & Dragons 2nd Edition\">"],"setting":"Planescape","statblock":{"Reave":{"Activity Cycle":"Carnivore","Alignment":"Day","Armor Class":"3 (8)","Climate/Terrain":"Any","Damage/Attack":"By weapon +2","Diet":"Average (8-10)","Frequency":"Uncommon","Hit Dice":"2+4","Intelligence":"B, individuals J,K,M","Magic Resistance":"None","Morale":"Steady (11-12)","Movement":"9","No. Appearing":"3-24","No. of Attacks":"2","Organization":"Band","Size":"M (6-7' tall]","Special Attacks":"None","Special Defenses":"Fading","THAC0":"19","Treasure":"Lawful evil","XP Value":"175"}},"title":"Reave"},"sources":["2613"],"statblock_names":[],"title":"Reave","prev_key":"razowing","next_key":"reaver","monster_path":"/appendix/reave"}},"staticQueryHashes":[],"slicesMap":{}}
