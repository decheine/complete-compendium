While the powers listed above are the most common, some aarakocra have different or additional powers.</p><p class=\"f\">A race of intelligent, birdlike creatures living in the deepest deserts of Athas, the rare Athasian <a href=\"/appendix/aarakocr\">aarakocra</a> spends its time soaring on thermals in search of food.</p><p>The aarakocra is 7 to 8 feet tall with a wingspan of 20 feet or more. Because of its large wingspan, an aarakocra can carry as much as 75% of its own body weight and still fly easily. An aarakocra can fly a short distance carrying a burden equaling 125% of its own body weight. The average body weight of a full grown male is 100 pounds and a female is 85 pounds.</p><p>Each wing has a &ldquo;hand&rdquo; at its midpoint, consisting of three fingers and an opposable thumb. The fourth finger forms the rigid leading edge of the wing. In flight the hands cannot be used, but on the ground the aarakocra can use its hands almost as a human would. The aarakocra's body is protected by a thin bony plate on the chest, much like a solid rib cage. Talons on its legs can be used as claws and can be retracted to reveal a second set of hands, also with three fingers and an opposable thumb. Except for the chest plate, the entire skeleton is hollow and extremely fragile.</p><p>From a distance, the Athasian aarakocra resembles a huge <a href=\"/appendix/bird\">vulture</a>. Its black eyes, set in the front of the head, provide excellent vision over a long range. The plumage is generally black with a white collar for adult males and black or brown with a smaller white collar for females. Adolescents are a mixture of brown and black. The beak is large and covers most of the head. Plumage begins at the crown of the head and is darker near the head, except for the collar. Athasian aarakocra speak their own language and the languages of vultures and other large birds. Some speak the common tongue (5% to 10% chance depending on how deep in the wastelands a tribe lives).</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Combat:</b> Aarakocra can fight in the air or on the ground. They prefer aerial combat since their bones are too fragile to withstand a solid blow from a human-sized opponent. In combat against creatures on the ground, they prefer to fly over their victim and drop weighted nets. Some aarakocra use darts to harass ground-based opponents.</p><p>If their opponents can fly, the aarakocra generally forgo the use of the net, although large groups sometimes use nets on flying creatures. Normally, aarakocra attack flying creatures with long spears, diving from above and allowing the momentum to carry the spear through the target. Such an attack doubles the damage if the aarakocra have been able to dive at least 50 feet. Only the very largest aarakocra can carry more than one of these spears, they can attack with both at once with no penalty, causing double damage on each strike. All diving attacks are made at +4 and should be treated as a charge attack. All other penalties and restrictions of charge attacks apply.</p><p>The effect of the aarakocra's nets depends on if the opponent is flying at the time it becomes entangled. Creatures on the ground that are hit by a net are entangled and unable to participate in any combat until they make a successful Strength check to get free of the net. Flying creatures hit by a net can no longer fly and immediately begin falling. If they cannot escape the net or use some magical means to arrest the fall, normal falling damage applies.</p><p>Unless victims are entangled in nets, aarakocra are cautious in ground combat. If the aarakocra outnumber their opponents they advance in a straight line and thrust with their spears. If outnumbered, or the opponents are particularly tough, the aarakocra withdraw. Victims entangled in nets are killed or incapacitated for use as food or ransom.</p><p>Athasian aarakocra are mindful of their physical limitations as well as their comparatively low psionic abilities. They do not normally initiate psionic combat. At the first sign of psionic powers from any of their victims, however, all aarakocra that have some ability will use whatever attack and defense modes they can in an attempt to destroy the threat. Large groups of is or more aarakocra may initiate psionic combat if their leaders feel they can win quickly and avoid physical combat.</p><p>In desperation, an aarakocra can attempt to bite an opponent in combat. Because of the unwieldiness of its beak, the aarakocra has a THAC0 of 18 if attacking with this appendage. Further, the birdman causes only 1d2 points of damage with the beak.</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Habitat/Society:</b> Athasian aarakocra live in tribes with 6-20 (2d8+4) members, depending on the prestige of the leader. The largest tribe ever recorded had 50 members. The tribal hunting territory depends on the size of the tribe, usually about 500 square miles for a tribe of 10 members. There are no rigid boundaries between tribes and border disputes are not uncommon.</p><p>Alignments of tribe members are similar to the alignment of the leader. A tribe that has a leader who is neutral good may have neutral good, chaotic good, lawful good, and true neutral members. A predominantly evil tribe does not recognize boundaries with other tribes and treats other tribes as inferior beings to be eliminated.</p><p>Athasian aarakocra aren't happy in enclosed spaces, but they they take refuge in a cave or building if necessary.</p><p>Nonevil tribes live in rocky aeries in the highest peaks they can find. Evil tribes are normally nomadic and use an aerie made by another tribe if they need to remain in an area for a long time, even if they have to evict the tribe that made the nest.</p><p>Aarakocra aren't friendly toward intruders in their territory, especially caravans. They try to extract a toll from the caravan for passage through the desert. Good-aligned tribes allow unhindered passage of caravans that pay a tribute. If someone refuses to pay the tribute, the aarakocra try to capture scouts or outriders from the party and hold them until an even larger tribute is paid. The payment may be either livestock or shiny objects. Aarakocra are smart enough not to be taken in by glass baubles instead of gems, although they cannot tell the difference between the more common gems and the rare ones.</p><p>Evil tribes ask for tribute and often attack a caravan whether it pays or not. Aarakocra always demand shiny objects such as stones. These tribes find humans and demihumans to be quite tasty and prefer them to other food.</p><p>Good-aligned tribes of aarakocra sometimes return a lost traveler to the edge of the desert after first removing any valuables the traveler may be carrying. On very rare occasions a tribe might return a lost group of travelers to the more frequently traveled parts of the desert, again after first taking any valuables as payment.</p><p>The oldest male is the leader of the tribal hunting party and has 4+4 Hit Dice. The oldest female is in charge of the tribal aerie and has 3+3 HD. In tribes that have more than 15 members, the next oldest aarakocra serves as shaman and has 3+3 HD; the shaman completes the triumvirate necessary for proper worship and the summoning of elementals. (Interestingly, no magic-using aarakocra has ever been recorded.) Tribes without a shaman cannot summon <a href=\"/appendix/element1\">air elementals</a>, which is an important part of aarakocra culture.</p><p>The shaman is the leader of the daily sun worship. Aarakocra worship the sun because it provides them with the thermals they need to soar in search of food. The shaman also leads the mystic rituals used to summon an air elemental. Summoning an air elemental is usually done only in preparation for the tribe's most sacred ceremony, the hunt. Small tribes must band together for this ceremony to allow the triumvirate to be formed.</p><p>The ceremony to summon an air elemental must be conducted at dawn and requires the oldest male and female to emit a highpitched keening whistle. The shaman conducts an intricate dance around them, simultaneously chanting an ancient summoning mantra.</p><p>The hunt is the final part of the initiation of adolescent aarakocra to adulthood and often takes the tribe far from their normal teritory. The target is always a <a href=\"/appendix/drakalsi\">silt drake</a>. The hunt is the only time the females leave the relative safety of the nest. Even an evil tribe will not interfere with a tribe on a hunt. An air elemental is often summoned to help find the drake, but never takes part in the actual combat. Although the adult members of the tribe take part in the initial phases of the combat, it is the initiates who deliver the final, killing blows to me drake. Scars from the hunt are considered a mark of pride among all aarakocra.</p><p>The females spend about eight months of the year incubating their eggs. Athasian aarakocra mate for life and a pair normally produces as many as 10 offspring. A female lays one egg a year. Constant incubation is not required because of the high daytime temperatures, so the females can maintain the nest and keep the tribe's treasure in order.</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Ecology:</b> Athasian aarakocra are high on the food chain and have no natural enemies other than <a href=\"/appendix/drakatha\">drakes</a>. Unless evil, aarakocra leave their own territory only to hunt the silt drake and return as soon as possible when the hunt is over. (Evil aarakocra attack others, as noted above.) Aarakocra eggs and hatchlings are sought after by wealthy land owners who wish to use the creatures as scouts and sentries. An egg can bring as much as 10 cp in Tyr's marketplace. Tribes that have had eggs or hatchlings stolen have long memories and sometimes take revenge against the thief at a later date. Captive aarakocra join any tribe they come in contact with.</p><p>Athasian aarakocra have a natural life span of 21-30 years.</p>\n","images":["<img src=\"grf/ds.gif\" width=\"150\" height=\"75\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Dark Sun\" title=\"Dark Sun\" align=\"right\">","<img src=\"img/aarakath.gif\" alt=\"Aarakocra (Athas)\" title=\"Aarakocra (Athas)\" border=\"0\" width=\"300\" height=\"360\" style=\"text-align:right;\" align=\"right\">","<img src=\"grf/add2_01.gif\" width=\"200\" height=\"56\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Advanced Dungeons & Dragons 2nd Edition\">"],"setting":"Dark Sun","statblock":{"Aarakocra (Athas)":{"Activity Cycle":"Day","Alignment":"Any","Armor Class":"7","Climate/Terrain":"Deep desert","Damage/Attack":"1d3/1d3 or by weapon","Diet":"Carnivore","Frequency":"Rare","Hit Dice":"2+2","Intelligence":"Average (8-10)","Magic Resistance":"Nil","Morale":"Steady (11)","Movement":"6, Fl 36 (C)","No. Appearing":"1d10","No. of Attacks":"2","Organization":"Tribal","Size":"M (20'+ wingspan)","Special Attacks":"Nil","Special Defenses":"Nil","THAC0":"17","Treasure":"Varies","XP Value":"65"}},"title":"Aarakocra (Athas)"},"sources":["2433"],"statblock_names":[],"title":"Aarakocra (Athas)","prev_key":"zygraat","next_key":"aarakocr","monster_path":"/appendix/aarakath"}}},"pageContext":{"monster_key":"andeloid","monster_data":{"TSR":["Dragon159"],"fullBody":"  <table cellspacing=\"0\" cellpadding=\"0\"><tr><th>Climate/Terrain:</th><td>Any (as per hosts)</td></tr><tr><th>Frequency:</th><td>Very rare</td></tr><tr><th>Organization:</th><td>Solitary</td></tr><tr><th>Activity Cycle:</th><td>Any (any; never sleeps)</td></tr><tr><th>Diet:</th><td>Parasite (as per hosts)</td></tr><tr><th>Intelligence:</th><td>Animal - 1  (variable; as per hosts)</td></tr><tr><th>Treasure:</th><td>Nil (as carried by hosts)</td></tr><tr><th>Alignment:</th><td>Neutral (as per dominant host)</td></tr><tr><th>No. Appearing:</th><td>1</td></tr><tr><th>Armor Class:</th><td>10 (AC of individual hosts)</td></tr><tr><th>Movement:</th><td>1 (see text)</td></tr><tr><th>Hit Dice:</th><td>2-24 (plus sum of hosts' Hit Dice)</td></tr><tr><th>THAC0:</th><td>19 or better (as per hosts' THAC0s +1)</td></tr><tr><th>No. of Attacks:</th><td>1 (as per hosts)</td></tr><tr><th>Damage/Attack:</th><td>Special (as per hosts)</td></tr><tr><th>Special Attacks:</th><td>Controls victims (as per hosts)</td></tr><tr><th>Special Defenses:</th><td>Immune to weapons, cold, and most spells; saving-throw bonuses (as per hosts)</td></tr><tr><th>Magic Resistance:</th><td>20%</td></tr><tr><th>Size:</th><td>Spore T; ooze S (variable)</td></tr><tr><th>Morale:</th><td>Fearless - 20 (Fanatic - 18)</td></tr><tr><th>XP Value:</th><td>As per andeloid's Hit Dice with Hit Dice modifiers as appropriate (plus the XP value of each of the hosts); spores have no XP</td></tr></table><p class=\"f\">Initial statistics are for an active &ldquo;ooze&rdquo; (an andeloid without hosts); values in parentheses are for a composite (an andeloid with hosts).</p><p> </p><p>The andeloid is a <a href=\"/appendix/ooslje00\">slime</a>like creature that forms a symbiotic link between its victims (&ldquo;hosts&rdquo;), joining their flesh together to form a single creature. In all the crystal spheres, few creatures are as bizarre or horrifying as these andeloid composites, chimerical meldings of individual beings.</p><p>An andeloid may be encountered in its inert state as a round crystalline spore about the size of a fist (3&rdquo; across). This spore has a shimmering, shifting color and waxy texture, often being mistaken for an unusual gem (AC 0, hp 4). A spore becomes active, assuming a flat, oozelike shape 2' in diameter, once it has been exposed to at least one point of damage from heat or flame, or once it is left within 5' of a live potential host for 2d6 rounds. A spore takes no damage from fire, though an active andeloid is not so immune (see &ldquo;Combat&rdquo;).</p><p>An andeloid without hosts is nearly mindless and has only one driving purpose - to take over a host. However, an andeloid composite is a group personality based on its component parts, directed by the most intelligent being in the composite and modified by the strongest attitudes of the other hosts and by the needs of the andeloid itself to survive and grow. A composite of several intelligent beings acts as if governed by a committee.</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Combat:</b> An active andeloid without a host moves slowly and lies in wait for a potential host. Anyone touched by the ooze must make a save vs. poison to avoid infestation (unconscious vfctims awaken if the save succeeds). A conscious victim can repel or kill the andeloid with flame or with a few spells noted later (they are immune to all other spells). Once the andeloid succeeds in infesting a victim, it bonds with the host's psyche and cannot be driven off, though it can be slain by spells or fire. A host taken over by an andeloid appears to have been covered with a ½&rdquo;-thick translucent slime; useful tools and weapons are retained, as is clothing (though the latter becomes soaked).</p><p>When a victim is added to a composite, a limb or body part of the host is stuck as if by glue to another host. Within a month, the flesh of the two creatures merges, and the united creature (a composite) cannot be separated normally into component hosts. If the andeloid is slain before a host merges with the composite, the victim may make a System Shock roll once per round to pull free. Creatures that have been fully melded into a composite will die once the andeloid binding them dies; their bodies cannot be separated again except by using a <i>wish</i> or <i>heal,</i> but they may be raised normally.</p><p>An andeloid composite combines many benefits of its hosts. The number of Hit Dice and hit points of a composite equals the total of those of the andeloid and its hosts (Hit Dice are used in calculating saving throws only, not THAC0 scores). Any damage suffered is subtracted from that total and is shared by all hosts of the composite. (Note that though an andeloid is immune to many things, this is not necessarily true of its hosts.) Special immunities, resistances, and defenses of any one host are shared by all other hosts. A composite gains +4 on saves vs. poison. All of the hosts are simultaneously slain once the hit-point total of the andeloid and its hosts reaches zero. However, the andeloid itself is not slain if not attacked by fire or spells; it is instead rendered dormant for 2d8 turns, after which it re-forms into a 2 Hit Dice ooze again and must hunt for new hosts.</p><p>A composite retains its hosts' attack forms. If a host can make several attacks, it makes one less than normal if that limb has melded to the composite, A host attacks with a +1 bonus to its normal THAC0. Damage done is as normally done by each host. Special attacks must be directed by the host that possesses that ability, but these are lost if the body part with those abilities is melded with another creature in the composite. Conversely, weaknesses of component hosts are shared by the entire composite, though a natural ability or defense may cancel a weakness.</p><p>The following spells have special effects on the andeloid, in addition to any beneficial effects to hosts: <i>cure disease</i> causes 3d6 points of damage to the andeloid; <i>neutralize poison</i> causes 1d6 points of damage to the andeloid; <i>regeneration</i> causes 2d10 points of damage to the andeloid and forces it to save vs. death magic or become dormant for 2d8 turns; <i>restoration</i> causes 3d6 points of damage and forces the andeloid to save vs. death magic or be destroyed. In this way hosts may be rescued from a composite.</p><p>Composites cannot fly or swim. Their land movement rates equal those of their slowest moving hosts.</p><p>An andeloid's overriding purpose is to survive and grow. An intelligent composite always attempts to capture powerful beings, if it can do so safely, in order to add them to the composite. The size of a composite is limited by the andeloid's Hit Dice. Young andeloids have only 2 Hit Dice, but gain 1 Hit Dice per three months of growth to a maximum of 24 Hit Dice. The total of all hosts' Hit Dice and levels cannot exceed that of the andeloid binding them. If a composite tries to &ldquo;collect&rdquo; a victim that has too many Hit Dice to be controlled, all attempts to turn that being into a host will fail.</p><p>In an effort to improve the composite, the andeloid may decide to absorb an entire host as food to provide space for an addition. This requires the decision of the controlling ego, and a period of time equal to one weel per Hit Die of the host (see &ldquo;Ecology&rdquo;)- This intentional absorption results in the melding of the absorbed personality's ego, altering the dominant ego accordingly.</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Habitat/Society:</b> Generally, intelligent races do not tolerate andeloids, which are sought out and destroyed as quickly as possible to prevent infestation. However, chaotic species may accept a single composite that has reached its current size limits. Some chaotic-evil and insane races may view melding with an andeloid as tantamount to becoming a hero of legend.</p><p>Since andeloids are driven by their dominant personalities, they can be either good or evil in nature. However, because of the loathing felt for andeloids by many races, there is a greater tendency for them to be savage monsters instead of benign, helpful colonies. Due to this lack of acceptance, composites tend to inhabit remote regions or follow nomadic lives traveling wildspace (if one host of a composite has spelljamming powers) and crystal spheres, staying in no place for long. Any treasure found is converted to easily carried items or cached on remote asteroids or moons.</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Ecology:</b> As long as its hosts are able to feed, the andeloid draws sustenance from its hosts' feeding. An andeloid may survive without food for a week, converting its hosts' stores of fat into energy to provide its hosts's needs. After a week of such deprivation, the parasite must begin to convert its hosts' Hit Dice into food at the rate of 1 Hit Dice per week, starting with the Hit Dice of its weakest host. As the Hit Dice are absorbed, the body of the host losing the Hit Dice is absorbed and eliminated from the composite.</p><p>After the andeloid is forced to consume all of its available hosts' Hit Dice, it becomes dormant a week later, forming spores that can survive for cons without air or sustenance. As many such spores are created as the andeloid itself has Hit Dice.</p><p>Andeloids do not reproduce other than by creating spores. An andeloid newly created from a spore has no memories of any previous existence.</p>\n","images":["<img src=\"grf/dr.gif\" width=\"150\" height=\"75\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Dragon Magazine\" title=\"Dragon Magazine\" align=\"right\">","<img src=\"img/andeloid.gif\" alt=\"Andeloid\" title=\"Andeloid\" border=\"0\" width=\"300\" height=\"360\" style=\"text-align:right;\" align=\"right\">","<img src=\"grf/add2_01.gif\" width=\"200\" height=\"56\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Advanced Dungeons & Dragons 2nd Edition\">"],"setting":"Dragon Magazine","statblock":{"Andeloid":{"Activity Cycle":"Any (any; never sleeps)","Alignment":"Neutral (as per dominant host)","Armor Class":"10 (AC of individual hosts)","Climate/Terrain":"Any (as per hosts)","Damage/Attack":"Special (as per hosts)","Diet":"Parasite (as per hosts)","Frequency":"Very rare","Hit Dice":"2-24 (plus sum of hosts' Hit Dice)","Intelligence":"Animal - 1  (variable; as per hosts)","Magic Resistance":"20%","Morale":"Fearless - 20 (Fanatic - 18)","Movement":"1 (see text)","No. Appearing":"1","No. of Attacks":"1 (as per hosts)","Organization":"Solitary","Size":"Spore T; ooze S (variable)","Special Attacks":"Controls victims (as per hosts)","Special Defenses":"Immune to weapons, cold, and most spells; saving-throw bonuses (as per hosts)","THAC0":"19 or better (as per hosts' THAC0s +1)","Treasure":"Nil (as carried by hosts)","XP Value":"As per andeloid's Hit Dice with Hit Dice modifiers as appropriate (plus the XP value of each of the hosts); spores have no XP"}},"title":"Andeloid"},"sources":["Dragon159"],"statblock_names":[],"title":"Andeloid","prev_key":"ancimari","next_key":"anemongs","monster_path":"/appendix/andeloid"}},"staticQueryHashes":[],"slicesMap":{}}
