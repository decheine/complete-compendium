While the powers listed above are the most common, some aarakocra have different or additional powers.</p><p class=\"f\">A race of intelligent, birdlike creatures living in the deepest deserts of Athas, the rare Athasian <a href=\"/appendix/aarakocr\">aarakocra</a> spends its time soaring on thermals in search of food.</p><p>The aarakocra is 7 to 8 feet tall with a wingspan of 20 feet or more. Because of its large wingspan, an aarakocra can carry as much as 75% of its own body weight and still fly easily. An aarakocra can fly a short distance carrying a burden equaling 125% of its own body weight. The average body weight of a full grown male is 100 pounds and a female is 85 pounds.</p><p>Each wing has a &ldquo;hand&rdquo; at its midpoint, consisting of three fingers and an opposable thumb. The fourth finger forms the rigid leading edge of the wing. In flight the hands cannot be used, but on the ground the aarakocra can use its hands almost as a human would. The aarakocra's body is protected by a thin bony plate on the chest, much like a solid rib cage. Talons on its legs can be used as claws and can be retracted to reveal a second set of hands, also with three fingers and an opposable thumb. Except for the chest plate, the entire skeleton is hollow and extremely fragile.</p><p>From a distance, the Athasian aarakocra resembles a huge <a href=\"/appendix/bird\">vulture</a>. Its black eyes, set in the front of the head, provide excellent vision over a long range. The plumage is generally black with a white collar for adult males and black or brown with a smaller white collar for females. Adolescents are a mixture of brown and black. The beak is large and covers most of the head. Plumage begins at the crown of the head and is darker near the head, except for the collar. Athasian aarakocra speak their own language and the languages of vultures and other large birds. Some speak the common tongue (5% to 10% chance depending on how deep in the wastelands a tribe lives).</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Combat:</b> Aarakocra can fight in the air or on the ground. They prefer aerial combat since their bones are too fragile to withstand a solid blow from a human-sized opponent. In combat against creatures on the ground, they prefer to fly over their victim and drop weighted nets. Some aarakocra use darts to harass ground-based opponents.</p><p>If their opponents can fly, the aarakocra generally forgo the use of the net, although large groups sometimes use nets on flying creatures. Normally, aarakocra attack flying creatures with long spears, diving from above and allowing the momentum to carry the spear through the target. Such an attack doubles the damage if the aarakocra have been able to dive at least 50 feet. Only the very largest aarakocra can carry more than one of these spears, they can attack with both at once with no penalty, causing double damage on each strike. All diving attacks are made at +4 and should be treated as a charge attack. All other penalties and restrictions of charge attacks apply.</p><p>The effect of the aarakocra's nets depends on if the opponent is flying at the time it becomes entangled. Creatures on the ground that are hit by a net are entangled and unable to participate in any combat until they make a successful Strength check to get free of the net. Flying creatures hit by a net can no longer fly and immediately begin falling. If they cannot escape the net or use some magical means to arrest the fall, normal falling damage applies.</p><p>Unless victims are entangled in nets, aarakocra are cautious in ground combat. If the aarakocra outnumber their opponents they advance in a straight line and thrust with their spears. If outnumbered, or the opponents are particularly tough, the aarakocra withdraw. Victims entangled in nets are killed or incapacitated for use as food or ransom.</p><p>Athasian aarakocra are mindful of their physical limitations as well as their comparatively low psionic abilities. They do not normally initiate psionic combat. At the first sign of psionic powers from any of their victims, however, all aarakocra that have some ability will use whatever attack and defense modes they can in an attempt to destroy the threat. Large groups of is or more aarakocra may initiate psionic combat if their leaders feel they can win quickly and avoid physical combat.</p><p>In desperation, an aarakocra can attempt to bite an opponent in combat. Because of the unwieldiness of its beak, the aarakocra has a THAC0 of 18 if attacking with this appendage. Further, the birdman causes only 1d2 points of damage with the beak.</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Habitat/Society:</b> Athasian aarakocra live in tribes with 6-20 (2d8+4) members, depending on the prestige of the leader. The largest tribe ever recorded had 50 members. The tribal hunting territory depends on the size of the tribe, usually about 500 square miles for a tribe of 10 members. There are no rigid boundaries between tribes and border disputes are not uncommon.</p><p>Alignments of tribe members are similar to the alignment of the leader. A tribe that has a leader who is neutral good may have neutral good, chaotic good, lawful good, and true neutral members. A predominantly evil tribe does not recognize boundaries with other tribes and treats other tribes as inferior beings to be eliminated.</p><p>Athasian aarakocra aren't happy in enclosed spaces, but they they take refuge in a cave or building if necessary.</p><p>Nonevil tribes live in rocky aeries in the highest peaks they can find. Evil tribes are normally nomadic and use an aerie made by another tribe if they need to remain in an area for a long time, even if they have to evict the tribe that made the nest.</p><p>Aarakocra aren't friendly toward intruders in their territory, especially caravans. They try to extract a toll from the caravan for passage through the desert. Good-aligned tribes allow unhindered passage of caravans that pay a tribute. If someone refuses to pay the tribute, the aarakocra try to capture scouts or outriders from the party and hold them until an even larger tribute is paid. The payment may be either livestock or shiny objects. Aarakocra are smart enough not to be taken in by glass baubles instead of gems, although they cannot tell the difference between the more common gems and the rare ones.</p><p>Evil tribes ask for tribute and often attack a caravan whether it pays or not. Aarakocra always demand shiny objects such as stones. These tribes find humans and demihumans to be quite tasty and prefer them to other food.</p><p>Good-aligned tribes of aarakocra sometimes return a lost traveler to the edge of the desert after first removing any valuables the traveler may be carrying. On very rare occasions a tribe might return a lost group of travelers to the more frequently traveled parts of the desert, again after first taking any valuables as payment.</p><p>The oldest male is the leader of the tribal hunting party and has 4+4 Hit Dice. The oldest female is in charge of the tribal aerie and has 3+3 HD. In tribes that have more than 15 members, the next oldest aarakocra serves as shaman and has 3+3 HD; the shaman completes the triumvirate necessary for proper worship and the summoning of elementals. (Interestingly, no magic-using aarakocra has ever been recorded.) Tribes without a shaman cannot summon <a href=\"/appendix/element1\">air elementals</a>, which is an important part of aarakocra culture.</p><p>The shaman is the leader of the daily sun worship. Aarakocra worship the sun because it provides them with the thermals they need to soar in search of food. The shaman also leads the mystic rituals used to summon an air elemental. Summoning an air elemental is usually done only in preparation for the tribe's most sacred ceremony, the hunt. Small tribes must band together for this ceremony to allow the triumvirate to be formed.</p><p>The ceremony to summon an air elemental must be conducted at dawn and requires the oldest male and female to emit a highpitched keening whistle. The shaman conducts an intricate dance around them, simultaneously chanting an ancient summoning mantra.</p><p>The hunt is the final part of the initiation of adolescent aarakocra to adulthood and often takes the tribe far from their normal teritory. The target is always a <a href=\"/appendix/drakalsi\">silt drake</a>. The hunt is the only time the females leave the relative safety of the nest. Even an evil tribe will not interfere with a tribe on a hunt. An air elemental is often summoned to help find the drake, but never takes part in the actual combat. Although the adult members of the tribe take part in the initial phases of the combat, it is the initiates who deliver the final, killing blows to me drake. Scars from the hunt are considered a mark of pride among all aarakocra.</p><p>The females spend about eight months of the year incubating their eggs. Athasian aarakocra mate for life and a pair normally produces as many as 10 offspring. A female lays one egg a year. Constant incubation is not required because of the high daytime temperatures, so the females can maintain the nest and keep the tribe's treasure in order.</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Ecology:</b> Athasian aarakocra are high on the food chain and have no natural enemies other than <a href=\"/appendix/drakatha\">drakes</a>. Unless evil, aarakocra leave their own territory only to hunt the silt drake and return as soon as possible when the hunt is over. (Evil aarakocra attack others, as noted above.) Aarakocra eggs and hatchlings are sought after by wealthy land owners who wish to use the creatures as scouts and sentries. An egg can bring as much as 10 cp in Tyr's marketplace. Tribes that have had eggs or hatchlings stolen have long memories and sometimes take revenge against the thief at a later date. Captive aarakocra join any tribe they come in contact with.</p><p>Athasian aarakocra have a natural life span of 21-30 years.</p><p></p><br clear=\"all\" style=\"clear:both; height:0;\">\r\n","images":["<img src=\"grf/ds.gif\" width=\"150\" height=\"75\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Dark Sun\" title=\"Dark Sun\" align=\"right\">","<img src=\"img/aarakath.gif\" alt=\"Aarakocra (Athas)\" title=\"Aarakocra (Athas)\" border=\"0\" width=\"300\" height=\"360\" style=\"text-align:right;\" align=\"right\">","<img src=\"grf/add2_01.gif\" width=\"200\" height=\"56\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Advanced Dungeons & Dragons 2nd Edition\">"],"setting":"Dark Sun","statblock":{"Aarakocra (Athas)":{"Activity Cycle":"Day","Alignment":"Any","Armor Class":"7","Climate/Terrain":"Deep desert","Damage/Attack":"1d3/1d3 or by weapon","Diet":"Carnivore","Frequency":"Rare","Hit Dice":"2+2","Intelligence":"Average (8-10)","Magic Resistance":"Nil","Morale":"Steady (11)","Movement":"6, Fl 36 (C)","No. Appearing":"1d10","No. of Attacks":"2","Organization":"Tribal","Size":"M (20'+ wingspan)","Special Attacks":"Nil","Special Defenses":"Nil","THAC0":"17","Treasure":"Varies","XP Value":"65"}},"title":"Aarakocra (Athas)"},"sources":["2433"],"statblock_names":[],"title":"Aarakocra (Athas)","prev_key":"zygraat","next_key":"aarakocr","monster_path":"/appendix/aarakath"}}},"pageContext":{"monster_key":"mememori","monster_data":{"TSR":["Dragon186"],"fullBody":"  <table cellspacing=\"0\" cellpadding=\"0\"><tr><th>Climate/Terrain:</th><td>Any</td></tr><tr><th>Frequency:</th><td>Uncommon or very rare</td></tr><tr><th>Organization:</th><td>Solitary</td></tr><tr><th>Activity Cycle:</th><td>Any</td></tr><tr><th>Diet:</th><td>None</td></tr><tr><th>Intelligence:</th><td>Average (9)</td></tr><tr><th>Treasure:</th><td>See below</td></tr><tr><th>Alignment:</th><td>Neutral</td></tr><tr><th>No. Appearing:</th><td>1</td></tr><tr><th>Armor Class:</th><td>3</td></tr><tr><th>Movement:</th><td>18</td></tr><tr><th>Hit Dice:</th><td>4</td></tr><tr><th>THAC0:</th><td>17</td></tr><tr><th>No. of Attacks:</th><td>1</td></tr><tr><th>Damage/Attack:</th><td>See below</td></tr><tr><th>Special Attacks:</th><td>Nil</td></tr><tr><th>Special Defenses:</th><td>See below</td></tr><tr><th>Magic Resistance:</th><td>Nil</td></tr><tr><th>Size:</th><td>M</td></tr><tr><th>Morale:</th><td>Fearless (20)</td></tr><tr><th>XP Value:</th><td>10 per hit die of attacking energy when encountered</td></tr></table><p class=\"f\">While most undead are evil parodies of life, one type of undead has an entirely different origin and purpose. A memento mori is created by a priest's spell to serve as an everlasting remembrance of a dead person, and as an ever-vigilant guardian over its body.</p><p>A memento mori takes the form of a translucent image of the deceased as it appeared when the spell that created it was cast. In extreme circumstances, this could mean that the memento mori has the horrible appearance of a mangled and partially rotted corpse, but usually the creating spell is cast only after the body has been properly readied for internment, and so the memento mori will present the appearance of a person as fine and lifelike as the skill of the funeral arranger could ensure.</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Combat:</b> A memento mori has no material body and can be hit by only magical weapons, with these doing damage equal only to their applicable pluses on hits (e.g., a long sword +1, +2 against undead would do two points of damage to a memento mori on a successful hit). Most spells do not affect them, except for those specifically targeting undead (such as <i>invisibility to undead</i>), those that affect the dead (such as <i>raise dead</i>, which kills the memento mori if successful), and those that affect magical creatures (such as <i>dispel magic</i>, which causes damage equal to the caster's level).</p><p>As the memento mori is far from being the most powerful of undead, it uses intimidation to augment its combat abilities. When confronted by potential tombrobbers, the memento mori appears in front of the body it guards and warns the robbers away from their goal. If they do not immediately flee when confronted by the memento mori, it causes a strong static-electric charge to play over all standing within 20' of either the body or the memento mori. This charge is nondamaging, but makes the victims' hair stand on end and causes an unpleasant tingling to play across their skin. The memento mori, now surrounded by a blue nimbus of crackling electricity, then warns the intruders that worse effects are in store if they should persist.</p><p>If the thieves continue to advance, or if they attack either the memento mori or the body it protects (damaging the body won't harm its guardian, but will anger it), it attacks, being careful to avoid harming its body or treasure.</p><p>At the time of its creation, a memento mori is invested with a limited amount of energy that can be expended by touching a target with its hand. The effect is like that of the <i>shocking grasp</i> spell. For each attack, it decides how many dice of damage it will do; and upon a successful hit that amount of damage is done to the victim and is subtracted from the memento mori's total energy forever.</p><p>This energy total may be considerable. An average memento mori will have from 1-100 hit dice of energy remaining to it. Some few will have more than that, others will have used all they were provided with. As their energy level drops over time due to encounters, a memento mori tries to conserve energy wherever possible, giving opponents ample opportunity to flee and never attacking retreating robbers. Thus, while a particular memento mori might have a store of 50 hit dice of electrical energy, it would not expend this in one or two high-damage attacks. Instead, it would make a preliminary attack using only one or two dice of electricity, and after scoring a hit, would pull back and warn its opponents to leave or suffer worse. If this fails to dissuade the tomb-robbers, it will escalate the attacks while continually entreating its victims to withdraw.</p><p>As the memento mori has no purpose but to protect its body and treasures, it will not refrain from using every hit die left to it to prevent even a single attack if that is necessary. A memento mori with no remaining energy will still behave like one with damaging power, threatening potential robbers with its static charge and letting the charred remains of any previous robbers speak for themselves.</p><p>A memento mori does not differentiate between its body and its treasures, so deals threatening to endanger one in favor of preserving the other will not be accepted. If some part of the treasure is stolen, the memento mori will stay to protect the greater portion remaining.</p><p>If the majority of what it guards is destroyed, either by action of intelligent beings or by decay, the memento mori focuses its attention on whatever remains, even if that involves traveling to a distant land, unerringly seeking some small item of value that was stolen decades before. When it finds its treasure, it guards it wherever it happens to be, as it has no body with which to move the item.</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Habitat/Society:</b> Because of the preparations required for the ritual that creates a memento mori, they are almost never found in wilderness areas far from the place they called home in life. They are common in inhabited regions where ancestor worship, mummification, and other forms of preserving or remembering the dead are practiced, for &ldquo;memento mori&rdquo; means &ldquo;remembrance of the dead&rdquo;. In these areas, no memento mori roam the streets, but are found in tombs or shrines where their bodies have been laid to rest.</p><p>The body that a memento mori guards will usually be adorned in the finest funeral garb and funerary gifts the family could afford, and it is these things that make up its treasure: anything from a few art objects and gaudy trinkets (the spell creating the memento mori is itself an expensive gift to the memory of the deceased) to a princely sum such as treasure types B or E.</p><p>As a memento mori is formed from a part of the soul of the dead body it guards, it retains the memories it possessed in life. This provides mourners with an opportunity to be comforted by speaking with the departed, and in some cultures, new generations are introduced to the memento mori of revered ancestors who died before they were born, hearing the family history from the lips of those who actually lived it. A memento mori is perfectly willing to converse with anyone, even a nonrelative, who makes no attempt to disturb its treasures or body.</p><p>Unfortunately, the memento mori has no lasting memory of events that occur after its creation, nor does it have any more personality than a video-recording would have. Thus, each encounter it has with a person, whether loving relative or avaricious tomb-robber, is treated as if it were the first such, and even if a family's tomb complex contains more than one memento mori these shades will not conduct conversations among themselves, as none has any desire or ability to benefit from discussions with equally dead souls. As a corollary, if tomb-robbers threaten the treasures of one memento mori, but stay more than 20' from all the goods of another memento mori-protected body, the second undead will do nothing to assist its fellow, even if they were related in life.</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Ecology:</b> A memento mori eats nothing, produces no byproducts, and as does not actively hunt the living, and is even further divorced from the greater ecology of the world than most evil undead.</p><h3>Create memento mori</h3><table cellspacing=\"0\" cellpadding=\"0\"><tr><td>3rd-level Priest Spell</td></tr><tr><td>Sphere: Necromantic</td></tr><tr><td>Range: Touch</td></tr><tr><td>Components: V, S, M</td></tr><tr><td>Duration: Permanent</td></tr><tr><td>Casting Time: 2 hours, plus 1 hour for every die of energy imparted</td></tr><tr><td>Area of Effect: Body touched</td></tr><tr><td>Saving Throw: See below</td></tr></table><p>The casting of this spell on a dead body causes a sliver of the soul that once inhabited the body to return to the Prime Material plane and become a memento mori, standing guard over its body. Only one memento mori can be made from each persons soul, as a loss of a greater number of soul-slivers would be detrimental to the soul wherever it now rests. In addition, a memento mori cannot be created if the body of the deceased is not present, nor if the body or soul of the deceased has already been turned into some other form of undead. Unlike other spells that create undead, this use of <i>create memento mori</i> is not considered evil if, when he was alive, the person who becomes the memento mori was part of a culture believing in this practice as an accepted custom.</p> <p>Each memento mori is able to cause a mild, static-electric effect that they use to defend their bodies against cowardly pests, and most are also imbued with electrical energy they can use in combat.</p><p>The material component for this spell is a collection of herbs, spices, oils, and precious substances that are placed in or about the body as it is prepared for internment. The cost of these stuffs is 500 gp, with an additional 25 gp worth of these things being required for every hit die of electrical energy the memento mori is to be imbued with (e.g., a memento mori to be imbued with two hit dice worth of energy would cost 550 gp, while 1,000 gp would produce a memento mori with 20 hit dice available to it). These oils and such are all incorporated into the body when the spell is cast and are not recoverable.</p><p></p><br clear=\"all\" style=\"clear:both; height:0;\">\r\n","images":["<img src=\"grf/dr.gif\" width=\"150\" height=\"75\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Dragon Magazine\" title=\"Dragon Magazine\" align=\"right\">","<img src=\"img/mememori.gif\" alt=\"Memento Mori\" title=\"Memento Mori\" border=\"0\" width=\"300\" height=\"360\" style=\"text-align:right;\" align=\"right\">","<img src=\"grf/add2_01.gif\" width=\"200\" height=\"56\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Advanced Dungeons & Dragons 2nd Edition\">"],"setting":"Dragon Magazine","statblock":{"Memento Mori":{"Activity Cycle":"Any","Alignment":"Neutral","Armor Class":"3","Climate/Terrain":"Any","Damage/Attack":"See below","Diet":"None","Frequency":"Uncommon or very rare","Hit Dice":"4","Intelligence":"Average (9)","Magic Resistance":"Nil","Morale":"Fearless (20)","Movement":"18","No. Appearing":"1","No. of Attacks":"1","Organization":"Solitary","Size":"M","Special Attacks":"Nil","Special Defenses":"See below","THAC0":"17","Treasure":"See below","XP Value":"10 per hit die of attacking energy when encountered"}},"title":"Memento Mori"},"sources":["Dragon186"],"statblock_names":[],"title":"Memento Mori","prev_key":"memedi","next_key":"menglis","monster_path":"/appendix/mememori"}},"staticQueryHashes":[],"slicesMap":{}}
