While the powers listed above are the most common, some aarakocra have different or additional powers.</p><p class=\"f\">A race of intelligent, birdlike creatures living in the deepest deserts of Athas, the rare Athasian <a href=\"/appendix/aarakocr\">aarakocra</a> spends its time soaring on thermals in search of food.</p><p>The aarakocra is 7 to 8 feet tall with a wingspan of 20 feet or more. Because of its large wingspan, an aarakocra can carry as much as 75% of its own body weight and still fly easily. An aarakocra can fly a short distance carrying a burden equaling 125% of its own body weight. The average body weight of a full grown male is 100 pounds and a female is 85 pounds.</p><p>Each wing has a &ldquo;hand&rdquo; at its midpoint, consisting of three fingers and an opposable thumb. The fourth finger forms the rigid leading edge of the wing. In flight the hands cannot be used, but on the ground the aarakocra can use its hands almost as a human would. The aarakocra's body is protected by a thin bony plate on the chest, much like a solid rib cage. Talons on its legs can be used as claws and can be retracted to reveal a second set of hands, also with three fingers and an opposable thumb. Except for the chest plate, the entire skeleton is hollow and extremely fragile.</p><p>From a distance, the Athasian aarakocra resembles a huge <a href=\"/appendix/bird\">vulture</a>. Its black eyes, set in the front of the head, provide excellent vision over a long range. The plumage is generally black with a white collar for adult males and black or brown with a smaller white collar for females. Adolescents are a mixture of brown and black. The beak is large and covers most of the head. Plumage begins at the crown of the head and is darker near the head, except for the collar. Athasian aarakocra speak their own language and the languages of vultures and other large birds. Some speak the common tongue (5% to 10% chance depending on how deep in the wastelands a tribe lives).</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Combat:</b> Aarakocra can fight in the air or on the ground. They prefer aerial combat since their bones are too fragile to withstand a solid blow from a human-sized opponent. In combat against creatures on the ground, they prefer to fly over their victim and drop weighted nets. Some aarakocra use darts to harass ground-based opponents.</p><p>If their opponents can fly, the aarakocra generally forgo the use of the net, although large groups sometimes use nets on flying creatures. Normally, aarakocra attack flying creatures with long spears, diving from above and allowing the momentum to carry the spear through the target. Such an attack doubles the damage if the aarakocra have been able to dive at least 50 feet. Only the very largest aarakocra can carry more than one of these spears, they can attack with both at once with no penalty, causing double damage on each strike. All diving attacks are made at +4 and should be treated as a charge attack. All other penalties and restrictions of charge attacks apply.</p><p>The effect of the aarakocra's nets depends on if the opponent is flying at the time it becomes entangled. Creatures on the ground that are hit by a net are entangled and unable to participate in any combat until they make a successful Strength check to get free of the net. Flying creatures hit by a net can no longer fly and immediately begin falling. If they cannot escape the net or use some magical means to arrest the fall, normal falling damage applies.</p><p>Unless victims are entangled in nets, aarakocra are cautious in ground combat. If the aarakocra outnumber their opponents they advance in a straight line and thrust with their spears. If outnumbered, or the opponents are particularly tough, the aarakocra withdraw. Victims entangled in nets are killed or incapacitated for use as food or ransom.</p><p>Athasian aarakocra are mindful of their physical limitations as well as their comparatively low psionic abilities. They do not normally initiate psionic combat. At the first sign of psionic powers from any of their victims, however, all aarakocra that have some ability will use whatever attack and defense modes they can in an attempt to destroy the threat. Large groups of is or more aarakocra may initiate psionic combat if their leaders feel they can win quickly and avoid physical combat.</p><p>In desperation, an aarakocra can attempt to bite an opponent in combat. Because of the unwieldiness of its beak, the aarakocra has a THAC0 of 18 if attacking with this appendage. Further, the birdman causes only 1d2 points of damage with the beak.</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Habitat/Society:</b> Athasian aarakocra live in tribes with 6-20 (2d8+4) members, depending on the prestige of the leader. The largest tribe ever recorded had 50 members. The tribal hunting territory depends on the size of the tribe, usually about 500 square miles for a tribe of 10 members. There are no rigid boundaries between tribes and border disputes are not uncommon.</p><p>Alignments of tribe members are similar to the alignment of the leader. A tribe that has a leader who is neutral good may have neutral good, chaotic good, lawful good, and true neutral members. A predominantly evil tribe does not recognize boundaries with other tribes and treats other tribes as inferior beings to be eliminated.</p><p>Athasian aarakocra aren't happy in enclosed spaces, but they they take refuge in a cave or building if necessary.</p><p>Nonevil tribes live in rocky aeries in the highest peaks they can find. Evil tribes are normally nomadic and use an aerie made by another tribe if they need to remain in an area for a long time, even if they have to evict the tribe that made the nest.</p><p>Aarakocra aren't friendly toward intruders in their territory, especially caravans. They try to extract a toll from the caravan for passage through the desert. Good-aligned tribes allow unhindered passage of caravans that pay a tribute. If someone refuses to pay the tribute, the aarakocra try to capture scouts or outriders from the party and hold them until an even larger tribute is paid. The payment may be either livestock or shiny objects. Aarakocra are smart enough not to be taken in by glass baubles instead of gems, although they cannot tell the difference between the more common gems and the rare ones.</p><p>Evil tribes ask for tribute and often attack a caravan whether it pays or not. Aarakocra always demand shiny objects such as stones. These tribes find humans and demihumans to be quite tasty and prefer them to other food.</p><p>Good-aligned tribes of aarakocra sometimes return a lost traveler to the edge of the desert after first removing any valuables the traveler may be carrying. On very rare occasions a tribe might return a lost group of travelers to the more frequently traveled parts of the desert, again after first taking any valuables as payment.</p><p>The oldest male is the leader of the tribal hunting party and has 4+4 Hit Dice. The oldest female is in charge of the tribal aerie and has 3+3 HD. In tribes that have more than 15 members, the next oldest aarakocra serves as shaman and has 3+3 HD; the shaman completes the triumvirate necessary for proper worship and the summoning of elementals. (Interestingly, no magic-using aarakocra has ever been recorded.) Tribes without a shaman cannot summon <a href=\"/appendix/element1\">air elementals</a>, which is an important part of aarakocra culture.</p><p>The shaman is the leader of the daily sun worship. Aarakocra worship the sun because it provides them with the thermals they need to soar in search of food. The shaman also leads the mystic rituals used to summon an air elemental. Summoning an air elemental is usually done only in preparation for the tribe's most sacred ceremony, the hunt. Small tribes must band together for this ceremony to allow the triumvirate to be formed.</p><p>The ceremony to summon an air elemental must be conducted at dawn and requires the oldest male and female to emit a highpitched keening whistle. The shaman conducts an intricate dance around them, simultaneously chanting an ancient summoning mantra.</p><p>The hunt is the final part of the initiation of adolescent aarakocra to adulthood and often takes the tribe far from their normal teritory. The target is always a <a href=\"/appendix/drakalsi\">silt drake</a>. The hunt is the only time the females leave the relative safety of the nest. Even an evil tribe will not interfere with a tribe on a hunt. An air elemental is often summoned to help find the drake, but never takes part in the actual combat. Although the adult members of the tribe take part in the initial phases of the combat, it is the initiates who deliver the final, killing blows to me drake. Scars from the hunt are considered a mark of pride among all aarakocra.</p><p>The females spend about eight months of the year incubating their eggs. Athasian aarakocra mate for life and a pair normally produces as many as 10 offspring. A female lays one egg a year. Constant incubation is not required because of the high daytime temperatures, so the females can maintain the nest and keep the tribe's treasure in order.</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Ecology:</b> Athasian aarakocra are high on the food chain and have no natural enemies other than <a href=\"/appendix/drakatha\">drakes</a>. Unless evil, aarakocra leave their own territory only to hunt the silt drake and return as soon as possible when the hunt is over. (Evil aarakocra attack others, as noted above.) Aarakocra eggs and hatchlings are sought after by wealthy land owners who wish to use the creatures as scouts and sentries. An egg can bring as much as 10 cp in Tyr's marketplace. Tribes that have had eggs or hatchlings stolen have long memories and sometimes take revenge against the thief at a later date. Captive aarakocra join any tribe they come in contact with.</p><p>Athasian aarakocra have a natural life span of 21-30 years.</p>\n","images":["<img src=\"grf/ds.gif\" width=\"150\" height=\"75\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Dark Sun\" title=\"Dark Sun\" align=\"right\">","<img src=\"img/aarakath.gif\" alt=\"Aarakocra (Athas)\" title=\"Aarakocra (Athas)\" border=\"0\" width=\"300\" height=\"360\" style=\"text-align:right;\" align=\"right\">","<img src=\"grf/add2_01.gif\" width=\"200\" height=\"56\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Advanced Dungeons & Dragons 2nd Edition\">"],"setting":"Dark Sun","statblock":{"Aarakocra (Athas)":{"Activity Cycle":"Day","Alignment":"Any","Armor Class":"7","Climate/Terrain":"Deep desert","Damage/Attack":"1d3/1d3 or by weapon","Diet":"Carnivore","Frequency":"Rare","Hit Dice":"2+2","Intelligence":"Average (8-10)","Magic Resistance":"Nil","Morale":"Steady (11)","Movement":"6, Fl 36 (C)","No. Appearing":"1d10","No. of Attacks":"2","Organization":"Tribal","Size":"M (20'+ wingspan)","Special Attacks":"Nil","Special Defenses":"Nil","THAC0":"17","Treasure":"Varies","XP Value":"65"}},"title":"Aarakocra (Athas)"},"sources":["2433"],"statblock_names":[],"title":"Aarakocra (Athas)","prev_key":"zygraat","next_key":"aarakocr","monster_path":"/appendix/aarakath"}}},"pageContext":{"monster_key":"ogrekryn","monster_data":{"TSR":["2105"],"fullBody":"    <table cellspacing=\"0\" cellpadding=\"0\"><tr class=\"bk\"><th> </th><th class=\"cn\">Ogre</th><th class=\"cn\">Orughi</th></tr><tr><th>Climate/Terrain:</th><td>Tropical, subtropical, and temperate/Plain, swamp, forest, jungle, hill, mountain, subterranean</td><td>Tropical and subtropical/Forest, hill, and mountain</td></tr><tr><th>Frequency:</th><td>Common</td><td>Very rare</td></tr><tr><th>Organization:</th><td>Tribe</td><td>Tribe</td></tr><tr><th>Activity Cycle:</th><td>Any</td><td>Any</td></tr><tr><th>Diet:</th><td>Carnivore</td><td>Carnivore</td></tr><tr><th>Intelligence:</th><td>Low (5-7)</td><td>Low (5-7)</td></tr><tr><th>Treasure:</th><td>Individual: M&times;10; Tribe: Q,S,B</td><td>Individual: Q; Tribe Q&times;10</td></tr><tr><th>Alignment:</th><td>Chaotic evil</td><td>Chaotic evil</td></tr><tr><th>No. Appearing:</th><td>2-20</td><td>2-12</td></tr><tr><th>Armor Class:</th><td>5</td><td>5</td></tr><tr><th>Movement:</th><td>9</td><td>9, Sw 18</td></tr><tr><th>Hit Dice:</th><td>4+1</td><td>4+1</td></tr><tr><th>THAC0:</th><td>17</td><td>17</td></tr><tr><th>No. of Attacks:</th><td>1</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><th>Damage/Attack:</th><td>1-10 (weapon)</td><td>1-6 (weapon)</td></tr><tr><th>Special Attacks:</th><td>+2 to damage</td><td>+2 to damage</td></tr><tr><th>Special Defenses:</th><td>Nil</td><td>Nil</td></tr><tr><th>Magic Resistance:</th><td>Nil</td><td>Nil</td></tr><tr><th>Size:</th><td>L (7-9' tall)</td><td>M (4-5' tall)</td></tr><tr><th>Morale:</th><td>Steady (11)</td><td>Unsteady (7)</td></tr><tr><th>XP Value:</th><td>175</td><td>175</td></tr></table><p class=\"f\">The <a href=\"/appendix/ogre\">ogres</a> of Krynn are bloodthirsty, savage brutes. They are feared and despised by all intelligent races.</p><p>Krynn ogres physically resemble the ogres of other worlds. They are taller than most humanoids, with thick and solidly muscled bodies. They have large heads with blunt noses, pointed ears, and high foreheads. A bony ridge covers their beady eyes, which are colored dull gray or blood red. Long, greasy hair grows from their lice-ridden scalps, dangling over their shoulders in matted tangles. Their dry skin, whose color ranges from dark brown to orange-yellow, is crusted with scabs and filth, and often covered with hairy warts. Krynn ogres have rows of sharp brown teeth, caked with grime. Black claws grow from their fingers and toes. Females resemble the males, though they are shorter and less muscular.</p><p>Krynn ogres wear the skins and furs of animals they have killed. These are made into loose smocks, long breech cloths, and heavy capes. These skins are not tanned or otherwise treated before they are made into clothing, making them stink like rotting meat. Ogres do not wear gloves or shoes of any kind - their thickly calloused soles provide protection and traction. Some wear stone necklaces, others paint their bodies with crude pigments.</p><p>Few creatures are as violent and cruel as ogres. With their low intelligence and flaring tempers, murder, vandalism, and abuse are commonplace in their societies. Greedy and covetous, ogres love treasure almost as much as they do bloodshed.</p><p>Krynn ogres speak their own language. Ogre chieftains and leaders usually speak common; 10% of tribesmen other than chieftains and leaders also speak common.</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Combat:</b> Like the ogres of other worlds, Krynn ogres are extremely dangerous. Not only is violence their common response to most problems, they are perfectly willing to fight to the death over the most trivial conflicts. An ogre is too dull-witted to utilize complex tactics: instead, it engages in brutal melee until either it or its opponent is dead. So intense is their violence that ogres must be restrained from pummeling their opponents long after they have been killed. Strangers are attacked mercilessly, including members of other ogre tribes. An ogre often would rather beat a stranger into submission than waste time speaking with him.</p><p>Ogres use spears, battle axes, maces, clubs, and similar melee weapons. These are either stolen from dead victims, or assembled from stone, wood, and other common materials. Though crudely made, ogre weapons are just as effective as their more carefully crafted counterparts. Ogres seldom use bows, slings, or other missile weapons; not only do they find them clumsy to use, they deny the ogres the physical satisfaction of beating and chopping their victims.</p><p>Ogres rarely wear armor, mainly because it is difficult to locate armor pieces large enough to fit them. Large ogres sometimes wear thick layers of furs and skins imbedded with chips of stone to give them an effective AC of 4.</p><p>Ogre leaders and chieftains are stronger than their followers and inflict significantly more damage. A leader is AC 3, has at least 30 hit points, attacks as a 7-HD creature, and gains an additional +1 damage bonus to his weapon attacks. A chieftain is AC 4, has at least 34 hit points, attacks as a 7-HD creature, and has an additional +2 damage bonus to his weapon attacks.</p><p>Immature ogres - those between the ages of 5-20 years - have no more than 3 hit points per Hit Die. They attack with their fists to inflict 1d4 points of damage. They can use simple weapons, such as clubs and axes, with a -3 penalty to inflicted damage.</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Habitat/Society:</b> Legend has it that the ogres were the first race to awaken on Krynn. The original ogres were graceful and attractive creatures, though they had an inclination toward evil. Their tribes flourished in all corners of the world. An early ogre clan leader named Igrane tried to convince the other tribes that if they failed to renounce their evil natures, they would be doomed to a future of conflict and destruction. The ogres rejected this prediction. Igrane abandoned them to their folly, taking with him a band of enlightened followers who came to be known as the Irda (see the <a href=\"/appendix/ogrehigh\">Ogre, High</a> entry for details).</p><p>Igrane's prediction, of course, came true. The rise of competing races brought about the end of the ogres' domination of Krynn. They were hunted and slaughtered by the <a href=\"/appendix/elf\">elves</a> and <a href=\"/appendix/dwarf\">dwarves</a>, driven into exile by the humans, and betrayed and enslaved by the <a href=\"/appendix/minokryn\">minotaurs</a>. Additionally, the various ogre tribes warred constantly with each other, reducing their numbers even further. In the end, the ogres were forced into the most remote reaches of Krynn, where they remain to this day. The good races avoid them, while the evil races see them as just another exploitable resource.</p><p>Ogre tribes make their homes in the grimmest of lands, where the grass is withered and brown, the earth is cracked and dusty, and the waters are foul and stagnant. Though ogre cities exist, most ogres live in small settlements. A typical ogre settlement is a collection of crude stone huts centered around a large water hole. Each hut is the home of three or four ogres. The tribal leader and chieftain (assuming the tribe is large enough to have both) live in private huts. A hut has no furnishings aside from old furs used for sleeping and the family's weapon collection. Outside of each hut are large racks supporting strips of meat that are drying over smokeless charcoal fires. A typical village also includes a treasure hut and a games pit that holds several <a href=\"/appendix/wolf\">wolves</a>, <a href=\"/appendix/bear\">bears</a>, or <a href=\"/appendix/snake\">snakes</a>; ogres enjoy dumping weaker tribesmen into the pit, then watching them try to scramble out.</p><p>An ogre family consists of a mated pair and one or two children. Females give birth to a single child once per year. When ogres reach the age of 20, they move into their own huts to start their own families, though they still remain with the tribe. Elderly ogres - those too old to hunt, bear children, or serve the tribe in any other way - are slain.</p><p>A tribe of ten or more members has one leader. In tribes of 20 or more, there is also a chieftain; in these cases, the leader serves as the chieftain's deputy. No more than half of the tribe are females. Ogres view females as inferior in all respects, useful only for menial jobs and for bearing children. The chieftain (or leader, in the case of smaller tribes) keeps careful track of the number of females in the tribe. If the number of female children exceeds the number of male children, the excess female children are killed.</p><p>Each tribe also keeps a number of slaves, equal to about 20% of the tribal population. Most of the slaves are human, but a few are elves or dwarves. Ogre tribes are constantly in need of new slaves, since tribesmen kill them for sport and eat them when they are too lazy to hunt.</p><p>An ogre hunting party usually consists of a leader and about six adult males, all heavily armed. A hunting trip lasts anywhere from a few days to several weeks, depending on the needs of the tribe and the scarcity of game. The leader treats his followers cruelly, for instance, using the weakest one as bait to lure hungry game. Followers sometimes arrange for the unfortunate demise of the leader on hunting trips. On their return, they report the loss of the leader to the tribe, then one of their number claims the leader's position.</p><p>Ogre leaders and chieftains are absolute rulers of their tribes. Crimes against the tribe include betrayal, theft, unjustified murder, and cowardice. Punishment for all such crimes is death, usually a lingering and painful one. Criminals might be hung upside down on a cliff to be roasted alive in the sun's rays, sealed in a bag with poisonous snakes and thrown into the sea to drown, or sunk in a quicksand bog while the tribe watches and cheers.</p><p>Ogres are required to bring all treasure taken from defeated victims back to their village. The chieftain (or leader in smaller tribes) claims half for himself. The ogres who retrieved the treasure are given a small share, usually no more than 10%, and the rest is placed in the treasure hut. The chieftain (or leader) awards treasure to tribesmen for special achievements, such as defeating powerful enemies; invariably, the chieftain presents most of these special awards to himself.</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Ecology:</b> All intelligent races go out of their way to avoid ogres. However, evil races occasionally employ ogres in their armies. The ogres are too stupid and undependable for complicated missions, but they willingly accept all manner of dangerous and distasteful tasks if the price is right. Some minotaur communities keep ogres as slaves.</p><p>Ogres hunt <a href=\"/appendix/wolverin\">wolverines</a>, wolves, and other woodland creatures for food, but they are also fond of human, elven, and dwarven flesh; <a href=\"/appendix/kender\">kender</a> and <a href=\"/appendix/gnome\">gnome</a> meat is considered a delicacy. Ogre fishermen scavenge the shorelines for dead fish, since this is easier than catching them, and dead ones are just as tasty as live ones.</p><p>No other races trade with ogres, but ogre tribes occasionally trade with each other. Such transactions often erupt in violence. One tribe, for instance, might trade animal skins and ale for a second tribe's gems and weapons. When the second tribe becomes drunk from the strong ale, the first tribe slits their throats and takes what they want.</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Orughi</b></p>  <p class=\"ni\">The orughi are an ogre race dwelling on remote islands north of Ansalon. They are shorter, tatter, and duller than most ogres, but they are no less aggressive. They have stringy golden hair, oily gray skin, and webbed hands and feet, enabling them to swim at twice their land movement rate.</p><p>Though good fighters, the orughi are not as strong as other ogres and are more prone to panic. When possible, orughi try to lure their opponents into the sea; because of their swimming skill and the fact that they can hold their breath for 20 rounds, they are dangerous opponents in the water. Orughi use battle axes and daggers and also carry special weapons called tonkks. These weapons, resembling iron boomerangs connected to long metallic cords, are used by the orughi to capture birds. The tonkks inflict no damage but can be used to ensnare victims up to a distance of 30 yards (they cannot be used in the water)</p><p>Because of their skill with these weapons, orughi attacks with tonkks are made with a +3 bonus to the attack roll (non-orughi use tonkks with a -2 penalty). The cord of the tonkk rapidly wraps itself around a successfully attacked victim; once per round, the victim can attempt a Dexterity check with a -2 penalty. If he succeeds, he has untangled himself. If he fails, he must roll a Strength check with a -4 penalty. If the Strength check falls, the victim is pulled ten yards closer to the orughi who entangled him.</p><p>Orughi live in crude wooden shacks on the shores of their islands; they spend most of their time hunting and flshing. They worship Zeboim, the evil Queen of the Sea, and build elaborate shrines in her honor near the water's edge. These shrines, resembling cylindrical towers of stone, can be seen from miles away; experienced sailors recognize them as a sign of an orughi settlement.</p><p>The orughi have no formal government. The eldest males of each family collectively rule the tribe. Disagreements are settled by combat. Orughi collect less treasure than other ogres. Their treasure caches seldom contain magical items, but usually include an ample supply of pearls and other gems recovered from the ocean floor.</p>\n","images":["<img src=\"grf/dl.gif\" width=\"150\" height=\"75\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Dragonlance\" title=\"Dragonlance\" align=\"right\">","<img src=\"grf/add2_01.gif\" width=\"200\" height=\"56\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Advanced Dungeons & Dragons 2nd Edition\">"],"setting":"Dragonlance","statblock":{"Ogre":{"Activity Cycle":"Any","Alignment":"Chaotic evil","Armor Class":"5","Climate/Terrain":"Tropical, subtropical, and temperate/Plain, swamp, forest, jungle, hill, mountain, subterranean","Damage/Attack":"1-10 (weapon)","Diet":"Carnivore","Frequency":"Common","Hit Dice":"4+1","Intelligence":"Low (5-7)","Magic Resistance":"Nil","Morale":"Steady (11)","Movement":"9","No. Appearing":"2-20","No. of Attacks":"1","Organization":"Tribe","Size":"L (7-9' tall)","Special Attacks":"+2 to damage","Special Defenses":"Nil","THAC0":"17","Treasure":"Individual: M&times;10; Tribe: Q,S,B","XP Value":"175"},"Orughi":{"Activity Cycle":"Any","Alignment":"Chaotic evil","Armor Class":"5","Climate/Terrain":"Tropical and subtropical/Forest, hill, and mountain","Damage/Attack":"1-6 (weapon)","Diet":"Carnivore","Frequency":"Very rare","Hit Dice":"4+1","Intelligence":"Low (5-7)","Magic Resistance":"Nil","Morale":"Unsteady (7)","Movement":"9, Sw 18","No. Appearing":"2-12","No. of Attacks":"1","Organization":"Tribe","Size":"M (4-5' tall)","Special Attacks":"+2 to damage","Special Defenses":"Nil","THAC0":"17","Treasure":"Individual: Q; Tribe Q&times;10","XP Value":"175"}},"title":"Ogre (Krynn)"},"sources":["2105"],"statblock_names":[],"title":"Ogre (Krynn)","prev_key":"ogreicsp","next_key":"ogremisc","monster_path":"/appendix/ogrekryn"}},"staticQueryHashes":[],"slicesMap":{}}
