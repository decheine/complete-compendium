While the powers listed above are the most common, some aarakocra have different or additional powers.</p><p class=\"f\">A race of intelligent, birdlike creatures living in the deepest deserts of Athas, the rare Athasian <a href=\"/appendix/aarakocr\">aarakocra</a> spends its time soaring on thermals in search of food.</p><p>The aarakocra is 7 to 8 feet tall with a wingspan of 20 feet or more. Because of its large wingspan, an aarakocra can carry as much as 75% of its own body weight and still fly easily. An aarakocra can fly a short distance carrying a burden equaling 125% of its own body weight. The average body weight of a full grown male is 100 pounds and a female is 85 pounds.</p><p>Each wing has a &ldquo;hand&rdquo; at its midpoint, consisting of three fingers and an opposable thumb. The fourth finger forms the rigid leading edge of the wing. In flight the hands cannot be used, but on the ground the aarakocra can use its hands almost as a human would. The aarakocra's body is protected by a thin bony plate on the chest, much like a solid rib cage. Talons on its legs can be used as claws and can be retracted to reveal a second set of hands, also with three fingers and an opposable thumb. Except for the chest plate, the entire skeleton is hollow and extremely fragile.</p><p>From a distance, the Athasian aarakocra resembles a huge <a href=\"/appendix/bird\">vulture</a>. Its black eyes, set in the front of the head, provide excellent vision over a long range. The plumage is generally black with a white collar for adult males and black or brown with a smaller white collar for females. Adolescents are a mixture of brown and black. The beak is large and covers most of the head. Plumage begins at the crown of the head and is darker near the head, except for the collar. Athasian aarakocra speak their own language and the languages of vultures and other large birds. Some speak the common tongue (5% to 10% chance depending on how deep in the wastelands a tribe lives).</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Combat:</b> Aarakocra can fight in the air or on the ground. They prefer aerial combat since their bones are too fragile to withstand a solid blow from a human-sized opponent. In combat against creatures on the ground, they prefer to fly over their victim and drop weighted nets. Some aarakocra use darts to harass ground-based opponents.</p><p>If their opponents can fly, the aarakocra generally forgo the use of the net, although large groups sometimes use nets on flying creatures. Normally, aarakocra attack flying creatures with long spears, diving from above and allowing the momentum to carry the spear through the target. Such an attack doubles the damage if the aarakocra have been able to dive at least 50 feet. Only the very largest aarakocra can carry more than one of these spears, they can attack with both at once with no penalty, causing double damage on each strike. All diving attacks are made at +4 and should be treated as a charge attack. All other penalties and restrictions of charge attacks apply.</p><p>The effect of the aarakocra's nets depends on if the opponent is flying at the time it becomes entangled. Creatures on the ground that are hit by a net are entangled and unable to participate in any combat until they make a successful Strength check to get free of the net. Flying creatures hit by a net can no longer fly and immediately begin falling. If they cannot escape the net or use some magical means to arrest the fall, normal falling damage applies.</p><p>Unless victims are entangled in nets, aarakocra are cautious in ground combat. If the aarakocra outnumber their opponents they advance in a straight line and thrust with their spears. If outnumbered, or the opponents are particularly tough, the aarakocra withdraw. Victims entangled in nets are killed or incapacitated for use as food or ransom.</p><p>Athasian aarakocra are mindful of their physical limitations as well as their comparatively low psionic abilities. They do not normally initiate psionic combat. At the first sign of psionic powers from any of their victims, however, all aarakocra that have some ability will use whatever attack and defense modes they can in an attempt to destroy the threat. Large groups of is or more aarakocra may initiate psionic combat if their leaders feel they can win quickly and avoid physical combat.</p><p>In desperation, an aarakocra can attempt to bite an opponent in combat. Because of the unwieldiness of its beak, the aarakocra has a THAC0 of 18 if attacking with this appendage. Further, the birdman causes only 1d2 points of damage with the beak.</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Habitat/Society:</b> Athasian aarakocra live in tribes with 6-20 (2d8+4) members, depending on the prestige of the leader. The largest tribe ever recorded had 50 members. The tribal hunting territory depends on the size of the tribe, usually about 500 square miles for a tribe of 10 members. There are no rigid boundaries between tribes and border disputes are not uncommon.</p><p>Alignments of tribe members are similar to the alignment of the leader. A tribe that has a leader who is neutral good may have neutral good, chaotic good, lawful good, and true neutral members. A predominantly evil tribe does not recognize boundaries with other tribes and treats other tribes as inferior beings to be eliminated.</p><p>Athasian aarakocra aren't happy in enclosed spaces, but they they take refuge in a cave or building if necessary.</p><p>Nonevil tribes live in rocky aeries in the highest peaks they can find. Evil tribes are normally nomadic and use an aerie made by another tribe if they need to remain in an area for a long time, even if they have to evict the tribe that made the nest.</p><p>Aarakocra aren't friendly toward intruders in their territory, especially caravans. They try to extract a toll from the caravan for passage through the desert. Good-aligned tribes allow unhindered passage of caravans that pay a tribute. If someone refuses to pay the tribute, the aarakocra try to capture scouts or outriders from the party and hold them until an even larger tribute is paid. The payment may be either livestock or shiny objects. Aarakocra are smart enough not to be taken in by glass baubles instead of gems, although they cannot tell the difference between the more common gems and the rare ones.</p><p>Evil tribes ask for tribute and often attack a caravan whether it pays or not. Aarakocra always demand shiny objects such as stones. These tribes find humans and demihumans to be quite tasty and prefer them to other food.</p><p>Good-aligned tribes of aarakocra sometimes return a lost traveler to the edge of the desert after first removing any valuables the traveler may be carrying. On very rare occasions a tribe might return a lost group of travelers to the more frequently traveled parts of the desert, again after first taking any valuables as payment.</p><p>The oldest male is the leader of the tribal hunting party and has 4+4 Hit Dice. The oldest female is in charge of the tribal aerie and has 3+3 HD. In tribes that have more than 15 members, the next oldest aarakocra serves as shaman and has 3+3 HD; the shaman completes the triumvirate necessary for proper worship and the summoning of elementals. (Interestingly, no magic-using aarakocra has ever been recorded.) Tribes without a shaman cannot summon <a href=\"/appendix/element1\">air elementals</a>, which is an important part of aarakocra culture.</p><p>The shaman is the leader of the daily sun worship. Aarakocra worship the sun because it provides them with the thermals they need to soar in search of food. The shaman also leads the mystic rituals used to summon an air elemental. Summoning an air elemental is usually done only in preparation for the tribe's most sacred ceremony, the hunt. Small tribes must band together for this ceremony to allow the triumvirate to be formed.</p><p>The ceremony to summon an air elemental must be conducted at dawn and requires the oldest male and female to emit a highpitched keening whistle. The shaman conducts an intricate dance around them, simultaneously chanting an ancient summoning mantra.</p><p>The hunt is the final part of the initiation of adolescent aarakocra to adulthood and often takes the tribe far from their normal teritory. The target is always a <a href=\"/appendix/drakalsi\">silt drake</a>. The hunt is the only time the females leave the relative safety of the nest. Even an evil tribe will not interfere with a tribe on a hunt. An air elemental is often summoned to help find the drake, but never takes part in the actual combat. Although the adult members of the tribe take part in the initial phases of the combat, it is the initiates who deliver the final, killing blows to me drake. Scars from the hunt are considered a mark of pride among all aarakocra.</p><p>The females spend about eight months of the year incubating their eggs. Athasian aarakocra mate for life and a pair normally produces as many as 10 offspring. A female lays one egg a year. Constant incubation is not required because of the high daytime temperatures, so the females can maintain the nest and keep the tribe's treasure in order.</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Ecology:</b> Athasian aarakocra are high on the food chain and have no natural enemies other than <a href=\"/appendix/drakatha\">drakes</a>. Unless evil, aarakocra leave their own territory only to hunt the silt drake and return as soon as possible when the hunt is over. (Evil aarakocra attack others, as noted above.) Aarakocra eggs and hatchlings are sought after by wealthy land owners who wish to use the creatures as scouts and sentries. An egg can bring as much as 10 cp in Tyr's marketplace. Tribes that have had eggs or hatchlings stolen have long memories and sometimes take revenge against the thief at a later date. Captive aarakocra join any tribe they come in contact with.</p><p>Athasian aarakocra have a natural life span of 21-30 years.</p>\n","images":["<img src=\"grf/ds.gif\" width=\"150\" height=\"75\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Dark Sun\" title=\"Dark Sun\" align=\"right\">","<img src=\"img/aarakath.gif\" alt=\"Aarakocra (Athas)\" title=\"Aarakocra (Athas)\" border=\"0\" width=\"300\" height=\"360\" style=\"text-align:right;\" align=\"right\">","<img src=\"grf/add2_01.gif\" width=\"200\" height=\"56\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Advanced Dungeons & Dragons 2nd Edition\">"],"setting":"Dark Sun","statblock":{"Aarakocra (Athas)":{"Activity Cycle":"Day","Alignment":"Any","Armor Class":"7","Climate/Terrain":"Deep desert","Damage/Attack":"1d3/1d3 or by weapon","Diet":"Carnivore","Frequency":"Rare","Hit Dice":"2+2","Intelligence":"Average (8-10)","Magic Resistance":"Nil","Morale":"Steady (11)","Movement":"6, Fl 36 (C)","No. Appearing":"1d10","No. of Attacks":"2","Organization":"Tribal","Size":"M (20'+ wingspan)","Special Attacks":"Nil","Special Defenses":"Nil","THAC0":"17","Treasure":"Varies","XP Value":"65"}},"title":"Aarakocra (Athas)"},"sources":["2433"],"statblock_names":[],"title":"Aarakocra (Athas)","prev_key":"zygraat","next_key":"aarakocr","monster_path":"/appendix/aarakath"}}},"pageContext":{"monster_key":"ixitixza","monster_data":{"TSR":["2166","1125"],"fullBody":"  <table cellspacing=\"0\" cellpadding=\"0\"><tr><th>Climate/Terrain:</th><td>Underdark lakes</td></tr><tr><th>Frequency:</th><td>Very rare</td></tr><tr><th>Organization:</th><td>Tribal</td></tr><tr><th>Activity Cycle:</th><td>Any (day)</td></tr><tr><th>Diet:</th><td>Omnivore</td></tr><tr><th>Intelligence:</th><td>High to Genius (13-18)</td></tr><tr><th>Treasure:</th><td>Nil (P,R,S)</td></tr><tr><th>Alignment:</th><td>Chaotic evil</td></tr><tr><th>No. Appearing:</th><td>3-10 (1d8+2) or 20-101 (9d10+11) in lair</td></tr><tr><th>Armor Class:</th><td>4</td></tr><tr><th>Movement:</th><td>3, swim 12</td></tr><tr><th>Hit Dice:</th><td>1+1 to 6+6</td></tr><tr><th>THAC0:</th><td>1+1, 2+2 HD: 19<br>3+3 HD 17<br>4+4, 5+5 HD 15<br>6+6 HD 13</td></tr><tr><th>No. of Attacks:</th><td>1 (2)</td></tr><tr><th>Damage/Attack:</th><td>1+1 to 3+3 HD 2d4 (+1d8)<br>4+4 to 6+6 HD 3d4 (+1d10)</td></tr><tr><th>Special Attacks:</th><td>Nil (see below)</td></tr><tr><th>Special Defenses:</th><td>Half damage from blunt weapons (unless +3 or above), +4 saving throw bonus against illusions and Elemental Water</td></tr><tr><th>Magic Resistance:</th><td>Nil</td></tr><tr><th>Size:</th><td>1+1 to 3+3 HD M (5' wingspan)<br>4+4 to 6+6 HD L (7-10' wingspan)</td></tr><tr><th>Morale:</th><td>Champion (16)</td></tr><tr><th>XP Value:</th><td>1+1 HD 65<br>2+2 HD 120<br>3+3 HD 175<br>4+4 HD 270<br>5+5 Hi3 420<br>6+6 HD 650+ (see below)</td></tr></table><p class=\"f\">Ixzan are a freshwater offshoot of the <a href=\"/appendix/ixitxach\">ixitxachitl</a> race. They are intelligent, evil creatures who resemble <a href=\"/appendix/ray\">manta rays</a> with barbed tails. They are variable in coloration, with most having gray underbellies and mottled, browngray upper surfaces. They are semi-amphibious and can survive out of water for one full turn before needing to return to it to breathe. If forced to remain out of water after one turn, they begin to suffocate (see the &ldquo;holding your breath&rdquo; rule in the <i>Player's Handbook;</i> treat Ixzan Constitution scores as 8+1d6). On land, they move in an awkward undulating manner, but because their skins are thick and rubbery they can traverse even relatively rocky terrain without undue discomfort, though they cannot negotiate walls, boulders, and like obstacles.</p><p>Ixzan are vicious, brutal creatures with better organization than their alignment might suggest. They worship the evil Power Ilxendren and enjoy stalking, sacrificing, and eating all manner of underdark races. They are especially fond of <a href=\"/appendix/gnome\">svirfneblin</a> flesh, though by no means adverse to giving surface <a href=\"/appendix/gnome\">gnome</a> a try. Their lifespan is variable, with high mortality among the young: those who survive to adulthood generally live from 40 to 70 years. Mutant types live shorter lifespans, spellcasting types longer ones. <a href=\"/appendix/vampire\">Vampiric</a> Ixzan are effectively immortal. Ixzan communicate in water by a form of sonar but cannot converse out of water since they cannot vocalize. They have good infravision (90-foot range).</p><p>Ixzan communities are more isolated than those of their seawater cousins and, as a result, they are more variable in nature, with a higher proportion of exceptional or unusual types.</p><p><b>XP Note:</b> Variant Ixzan are noted below. For purposes of determining XP rewards, count priests and wizards as one category higher than their HD alone would indicate if of 1st to 4th level, two XP categories higher if of 5th to 8th level, and three XP categories higher if of 9th or higher level. Vampiric types are always treated as three XP categories higher than their HD totals. Mutant Ixzan count as one XP category higher for each special attack they possess (poisonous tail, corrosive slime, automatic damage, etc.). All these bonuses are cumulative. If the category goes off the scale given above (for example, a 6+6 HD Ixzan with the abilities of a 7th-level wizard), consult the XP award table in the <i>Dungeon Master Guide</i>.</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Combat:</b> The normal Ixzan attack mode is its bite; those with other attacks will certainly use them, as Ixzan spellcasters are wily and use their spells to best effect. Ixzan use ambush tactics much as do their ixitxachitl cousins, except that they are capable of using them more effectively due to their superior spell use (especially <i>fly</i> and <i>invisibility</i>). Those able to cast <i>levitation</i> are fond of pressing themselves against ceilings in the manner of a <a href=\"/appendix/lurker\">lurker</a>, thus ambushing prey from an unexpected direction.</p><p>Ixzan make saving throws against all illusion/phantasm spells and all Elemental Water spells with a +4 bonus. They are permitted saving throws (with no bonuses) against spells of these schools even when no saving throw would normally be allowed. Ixzan suffer only half damage from blunt weapons below +3 enchantment, due to the hard, rubbery nature of their skins. Note that Ixzan spellcasters are not inconvenienced by a silence 15' radius spell since they do not vocalize during their spellcasting.</p><p>Priests form some 10% of any Ixzan community. Their spellcasting level is determined by rolling 1d4 and adding their HD total, to a maximum of 8th level. They can use spells from the following spheres: all, charm, combat, divination (minor access only), elemental earth, elemental water, healing, necromantic, protection, sun (reversed forms only), and weather (minor access only). Priest Ixzan do not gain bonus spells for high Wisdom scores, but they do gain the regular saving throw bonuses for superior Wisdom. A typical Ixzan priest has a Wisdom score of 12+1d6.</p><p>Wizard lxzan form some 5% of the total Ixzan population. These rare creatures have innate spell-like abilities. They do not require spellbooks, nor do they memorize spells. Spell-like powers are usable one per round, once per day each. Casting time is equal to the casting time for the spell, less 2 segments (to a minimum casting time of 1 segment). The spellcasting level of these wizards is determined by rolling 1d6 and adding the Ixzan's HD, to a maximum of 12th level. The number of spell-like powers is equal to the number of spells memorizable by a normal mage of the same experience level. Wizard Ixzan have Intelligence scores of 14+1d4. These spellcasters seem able to use any school of spells, but the most commonly reported are divination spells and those of the following list: charm person, cone of cold,fly, haste, ice storm, invisibility, invisibility 10&rdquo; radius, levitation, magic missile, mirror image, slow, and stoneskin. Many have the power of air breathing (the reversed form of water breathing). Note that priest and wizard skills are incompatible in the huge majority of cases. Only exceptionally rare individuals are priest-wizards.</p><p>Mutant Ixzan form only 2% of the population. They display a variety of abnormalities of form, determined by rolling 1d12 and consulting the table below:</p><table class=\"ip\"><tr class=\"bk\"><th>1d12</th><th>Mutation</th></tr><tr><td>1-6</td><td>Barbed tail, additional attack (1d8 or 1d10, depending on HD)</td></tr><tr><td>7-10</td><td>As above, but +poison (a failed saving throw indicates 1d6+6 additional points of damage)</td></tr><tr><td>11</td><td>Mutant has a thick ridge of jaw bone and can inflict a crushing bite (4d4) and then hold victim in its jaws for 3d4 automatic points of damage per round thereafter.</td></tr><tr><td>12</td><td>The mutant's body secretes a thick, corrosive slime. Out of water, a successful attack from such a mutant splashes the victim with acidic slime (1d6 hp of damage) which then coats the victim for 1d4+2 rounds (1d4 automatic damage per round). An oil- or alcohol-based solvent will remove this slime in one round.</td></tr></table><p>Mutant Ixzan are neither priests nor wizards. Other, very rare, types of mutation may also occur, such as freakishly thick skin (AC bonus, but the Ixzan may be blind and unable to orient itself except when underwater where it can use sonic detection effectively), natural magic resistance, or more than one tail.</p><p>Vampiric Ixzan are also rare, some 3% of the Ixzan population. Their bite causes the victim to lose one experience level or HD, with no saving throw permitted. Vampiric Ixzan may be priests (25% chance) or wizards (25% chance), but mutation seems to negate vampirism. Vampiric Ixzan regenerate 3 hp per round in combat. Greater vampiric Ixzan, akin to greater vampiric ixitxachitl rulers, are rumored to exist, but there are no reliable reports of them. Certainly, no form of vampiric Ixzan is ever encountered outside of a major lair or city.</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Habitat/Society:</b> Ixzan communities, encountered only in sizeable Underdark lakes, are some 20 to 100 mong. Both magic and <i>charmed</i> slaves are used to construct the peculiar pyramidal structures the Ixzan favor (these have significance for their reverence of their patron power). Lakes may even be deepened or extended, and underground passageways feeding water into them widened and their courses changed to bring extra water in the lakes.</p><p>Ixzan communities tend not to be dominated by a single exceptional leader-type but by an oligarchy of the most powerful of their priests and wizardy. Vampiric ixitxachitl almost alwavs rise to imporrant positions within such ruling elites, due both to their power and their innate longevity, unless killed off by vampiric rivals who want to sequester power for themselves.</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Ecology:</b> Ixzan have no natural predators. On the other hand, thev may have many enemies, although there is no particular race for which they have especial animosity, and rivailries vary from place to place. In one Underdark domain, Ixzan might get on well with <a href=\"/appendix/elfdrow\">drow</a>, whereas in another hundreds of miles away they might be deadly enemies. Ixzan have natural affinities with <a href=\"/appendix/aboleth\">aboleth</a> and <a href=\"/appendix/kuotoa\">kuo-toa</a>. Aboleth are very much the dominant party in any aboleth/Ixzan alliance. while Ixzan dominate kuo-toa in turn (regarding them as essentially rather stupid - strong, excellent guards, but stupid nonetheless). Ixzan will often be found living with kuo-toa, as their respective Powers (Blibdoolpoolp and Ilxenden are known to be on good terms with each other. In such communities, Ixzan and kuo-toa dwell in separate areas, with the Ixzan guarding the entrances to their central pyramid (if thev have one) zealously. Ixzan wizards use their spell powers to assist kuo-toa in battle, while allowing the gogglers do the meleeing and take most of the risks.</p><p>Kuo-toa sometimes use Ixzan in a ritual designed to weed out the weaker of their young. Young kuo-toa who have reached semi-maturity may be flung en masse into a great pool filled with Ixzan and forced to negotiate their way through an underwater maze while the Ixran gorge themseIves on the flesh of those who are not fast, strong, or ruthless enough. Since the kuo-toa spawn vast numbers of young, this ritualized weeding-out is regarded wholly dispassionately by them. Young who have not survived this ritual are not perceived as kuo-toa by their own kin; only afterwards are they regarded as individuals and adults.</p><p>Ixzan are likewise careless of their young. Ixzan are born neutral, and only acquire their chaotic evil alignment as the result of a gruelling process designed to make them as strong and ruthless as possible; those who fail to survive are neither mourned nor missed. The only exceptions are the fledgling wizards; other spellcasting Ixzan can intuitively sense when a young Ixzan has this ability and protect it fiercely, inculcating their own morality into it through a regiment designed to instill a sense of absolute self-worth along with contempt for &ldquo;lesser&rdquo; beings,</p>\n","images":["<img src=\"grf/xx.gif\" width=\"150\" height=\"75\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Advanced Dungeons & Dragons 2nd Edition\" title=\"Advanced Dungeons & Dragons 2nd Edition\" align=\"right\">","<img src=\"img/ixitixza.gif\" alt=\"Ixitxachitl, Ixzan\" title=\"Ixitxachitl, Ixzan\" border=\"0\" width=\"300\" height=\"360\" style=\"text-align:right;\" align=\"right\">","<img src=\"grf/tsr_sm.png\" width=\"56\" height=\"59\" border=\"0\" alt=\"TSR\">"],"setting":"Advanced Dungeons & Dragons 2nd Edition","statblock":{"Ixitxachitl, Ixzan":{"Activity Cycle":"Any (day)","Alignment":"Chaotic evil","Armor Class":"4","Climate/Terrain":"Underdark lakes","Damage/Attack":"1+1 to 3+3 HD 2d4 (+1d8)<br>4+4 to 6+6 HD 3d4 (+1d10)","Diet":"Omnivore","Frequency":"Very rare","Hit Dice":"1+1 to 6+6","Intelligence":"High to Genius (13-18)","Magic Resistance":"Nil","Morale":"Champion (16)","Movement":"3, swim 12","No. Appearing":"3-10 (1d8+2) or 20-101 (9d10+11) in lair","No. of Attacks":"1 (2)","Organization":"Tribal","Size":"1+1 to 3+3 HD M (5' wingspan)<br>4+4 to 6+6 HD L (7-10' wingspan)","Special Attacks":"Nil (see below)","Special Defenses":"Half damage from blunt weapons (unless +3 or above), +4 saving throw bonus against illusions and Elemental Water","THAC0":"1+1, 2+2 HD: 19<br>3+3 HD 17<br>4+4, 5+5 HD 15<br>6+6 HD 13","Treasure":"Nil (P,R,S)","XP Value":"1+1 HD 65<br>2+2 HD 120<br>3+3 HD 175<br>4+4 HD 270<br>5+5 Hi3 420<br>6+6 HD 650+ (see below)"}},"title":"Ixitxachitl, Ixzan"},"sources":["2166","1125"],"statblock_names":[],"title":"Ixitxachitl, Ixzan","prev_key":"ivycrawl","next_key":"ixitxach","monster_path":"/appendix/ixitixza"}},"staticQueryHashes":[],"slicesMap":{}}
