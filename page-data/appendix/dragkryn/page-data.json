While the powers listed above are the most common, some aarakocra have different or additional powers.</p><p class=\"f\">A race of intelligent, birdlike creatures living in the deepest deserts of Athas, the rare Athasian <a href=\"/appendix/aarakocr\">aarakocra</a> spends its time soaring on thermals in search of food.</p><p>The aarakocra is 7 to 8 feet tall with a wingspan of 20 feet or more. Because of its large wingspan, an aarakocra can carry as much as 75% of its own body weight and still fly easily. An aarakocra can fly a short distance carrying a burden equaling 125% of its own body weight. The average body weight of a full grown male is 100 pounds and a female is 85 pounds.</p><p>Each wing has a &ldquo;hand&rdquo; at its midpoint, consisting of three fingers and an opposable thumb. The fourth finger forms the rigid leading edge of the wing. In flight the hands cannot be used, but on the ground the aarakocra can use its hands almost as a human would. The aarakocra's body is protected by a thin bony plate on the chest, much like a solid rib cage. Talons on its legs can be used as claws and can be retracted to reveal a second set of hands, also with three fingers and an opposable thumb. Except for the chest plate, the entire skeleton is hollow and extremely fragile.</p><p>From a distance, the Athasian aarakocra resembles a huge <a href=\"/appendix/bird\">vulture</a>. Its black eyes, set in the front of the head, provide excellent vision over a long range. The plumage is generally black with a white collar for adult males and black or brown with a smaller white collar for females. Adolescents are a mixture of brown and black. The beak is large and covers most of the head. Plumage begins at the crown of the head and is darker near the head, except for the collar. Athasian aarakocra speak their own language and the languages of vultures and other large birds. Some speak the common tongue (5% to 10% chance depending on how deep in the wastelands a tribe lives).</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Combat:</b> Aarakocra can fight in the air or on the ground. They prefer aerial combat since their bones are too fragile to withstand a solid blow from a human-sized opponent. In combat against creatures on the ground, they prefer to fly over their victim and drop weighted nets. Some aarakocra use darts to harass ground-based opponents.</p><p>If their opponents can fly, the aarakocra generally forgo the use of the net, although large groups sometimes use nets on flying creatures. Normally, aarakocra attack flying creatures with long spears, diving from above and allowing the momentum to carry the spear through the target. Such an attack doubles the damage if the aarakocra have been able to dive at least 50 feet. Only the very largest aarakocra can carry more than one of these spears, they can attack with both at once with no penalty, causing double damage on each strike. All diving attacks are made at +4 and should be treated as a charge attack. All other penalties and restrictions of charge attacks apply.</p><p>The effect of the aarakocra's nets depends on if the opponent is flying at the time it becomes entangled. Creatures on the ground that are hit by a net are entangled and unable to participate in any combat until they make a successful Strength check to get free of the net. Flying creatures hit by a net can no longer fly and immediately begin falling. If they cannot escape the net or use some magical means to arrest the fall, normal falling damage applies.</p><p>Unless victims are entangled in nets, aarakocra are cautious in ground combat. If the aarakocra outnumber their opponents they advance in a straight line and thrust with their spears. If outnumbered, or the opponents are particularly tough, the aarakocra withdraw. Victims entangled in nets are killed or incapacitated for use as food or ransom.</p><p>Athasian aarakocra are mindful of their physical limitations as well as their comparatively low psionic abilities. They do not normally initiate psionic combat. At the first sign of psionic powers from any of their victims, however, all aarakocra that have some ability will use whatever attack and defense modes they can in an attempt to destroy the threat. Large groups of is or more aarakocra may initiate psionic combat if their leaders feel they can win quickly and avoid physical combat.</p><p>In desperation, an aarakocra can attempt to bite an opponent in combat. Because of the unwieldiness of its beak, the aarakocra has a THAC0 of 18 if attacking with this appendage. Further, the birdman causes only 1d2 points of damage with the beak.</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Habitat/Society:</b> Athasian aarakocra live in tribes with 6-20 (2d8+4) members, depending on the prestige of the leader. The largest tribe ever recorded had 50 members. The tribal hunting territory depends on the size of the tribe, usually about 500 square miles for a tribe of 10 members. There are no rigid boundaries between tribes and border disputes are not uncommon.</p><p>Alignments of tribe members are similar to the alignment of the leader. A tribe that has a leader who is neutral good may have neutral good, chaotic good, lawful good, and true neutral members. A predominantly evil tribe does not recognize boundaries with other tribes and treats other tribes as inferior beings to be eliminated.</p><p>Athasian aarakocra aren't happy in enclosed spaces, but they they take refuge in a cave or building if necessary.</p><p>Nonevil tribes live in rocky aeries in the highest peaks they can find. Evil tribes are normally nomadic and use an aerie made by another tribe if they need to remain in an area for a long time, even if they have to evict the tribe that made the nest.</p><p>Aarakocra aren't friendly toward intruders in their territory, especially caravans. They try to extract a toll from the caravan for passage through the desert. Good-aligned tribes allow unhindered passage of caravans that pay a tribute. If someone refuses to pay the tribute, the aarakocra try to capture scouts or outriders from the party and hold them until an even larger tribute is paid. The payment may be either livestock or shiny objects. Aarakocra are smart enough not to be taken in by glass baubles instead of gems, although they cannot tell the difference between the more common gems and the rare ones.</p><p>Evil tribes ask for tribute and often attack a caravan whether it pays or not. Aarakocra always demand shiny objects such as stones. These tribes find humans and demihumans to be quite tasty and prefer them to other food.</p><p>Good-aligned tribes of aarakocra sometimes return a lost traveler to the edge of the desert after first removing any valuables the traveler may be carrying. On very rare occasions a tribe might return a lost group of travelers to the more frequently traveled parts of the desert, again after first taking any valuables as payment.</p><p>The oldest male is the leader of the tribal hunting party and has 4+4 Hit Dice. The oldest female is in charge of the tribal aerie and has 3+3 HD. In tribes that have more than 15 members, the next oldest aarakocra serves as shaman and has 3+3 HD; the shaman completes the triumvirate necessary for proper worship and the summoning of elementals. (Interestingly, no magic-using aarakocra has ever been recorded.) Tribes without a shaman cannot summon <a href=\"/appendix/element1\">air elementals</a>, which is an important part of aarakocra culture.</p><p>The shaman is the leader of the daily sun worship. Aarakocra worship the sun because it provides them with the thermals they need to soar in search of food. The shaman also leads the mystic rituals used to summon an air elemental. Summoning an air elemental is usually done only in preparation for the tribe's most sacred ceremony, the hunt. Small tribes must band together for this ceremony to allow the triumvirate to be formed.</p><p>The ceremony to summon an air elemental must be conducted at dawn and requires the oldest male and female to emit a highpitched keening whistle. The shaman conducts an intricate dance around them, simultaneously chanting an ancient summoning mantra.</p><p>The hunt is the final part of the initiation of adolescent aarakocra to adulthood and often takes the tribe far from their normal teritory. The target is always a <a href=\"/appendix/drakalsi\">silt drake</a>. The hunt is the only time the females leave the relative safety of the nest. Even an evil tribe will not interfere with a tribe on a hunt. An air elemental is often summoned to help find the drake, but never takes part in the actual combat. Although the adult members of the tribe take part in the initial phases of the combat, it is the initiates who deliver the final, killing blows to me drake. Scars from the hunt are considered a mark of pride among all aarakocra.</p><p>The females spend about eight months of the year incubating their eggs. Athasian aarakocra mate for life and a pair normally produces as many as 10 offspring. A female lays one egg a year. Constant incubation is not required because of the high daytime temperatures, so the females can maintain the nest and keep the tribe's treasure in order.</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Ecology:</b> Athasian aarakocra are high on the food chain and have no natural enemies other than <a href=\"/appendix/drakatha\">drakes</a>. Unless evil, aarakocra leave their own territory only to hunt the silt drake and return as soon as possible when the hunt is over. (Evil aarakocra attack others, as noted above.) Aarakocra eggs and hatchlings are sought after by wealthy land owners who wish to use the creatures as scouts and sentries. An egg can bring as much as 10 cp in Tyr's marketplace. Tribes that have had eggs or hatchlings stolen have long memories and sometimes take revenge against the thief at a later date. Captive aarakocra join any tribe they come in contact with.</p><p>Athasian aarakocra have a natural life span of 21-30 years.</p><p></p><br clear=\"all\" style=\"clear:both; height:0;\">\r\n","images":["<img src=\"grf/ds.gif\" width=\"150\" height=\"75\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Dark Sun\" title=\"Dark Sun\" align=\"right\">","<img src=\"img/aarakath.gif\" alt=\"Aarakocra (Athas)\" title=\"Aarakocra (Athas)\" border=\"0\" width=\"300\" height=\"360\" style=\"text-align:right;\" align=\"right\">","<img src=\"grf/add2_01.gif\" width=\"200\" height=\"56\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Advanced Dungeons & Dragons 2nd Edition\">"],"setting":"Dark Sun","statblock":{"Aarakocra (Athas)":{"Activity Cycle":"Day","Alignment":"Any","Armor Class":"7","Climate/Terrain":"Deep desert","Damage/Attack":"1d3/1d3 or by weapon","Diet":"Carnivore","Frequency":"Rare","Hit Dice":"2+2","Intelligence":"Average (8-10)","Magic Resistance":"Nil","Morale":"Steady (11)","Movement":"6, Fl 36 (C)","No. Appearing":"1d10","No. of Attacks":"2","Organization":"Tribal","Size":"M (20'+ wingspan)","Special Attacks":"Nil","Special Defenses":"Nil","THAC0":"17","Treasure":"Varies","XP Value":"65"}},"title":"Aarakocra (Athas)"},"sources":["2433"],"statblock_names":[],"title":"Aarakocra (Athas)","prev_key":"zygraat","next_key":"aarakocr","monster_path":"/appendix/aarakath"}}},"pageContext":{"monster_key":"dragkryn","monster_data":{"TSR":["2105"],"fullBody":"  <p class=\"f\">Dragons are the true children of Krynn, embodying the elemental forces themselves. The most majestic and dignified of all the world's creatures, dragons are power incarnate, capable of inspiring awe and fear in all who behold them.</p><p>While the dragons of Krynn are physically similar to the <a href=\"/appendix/dragon\">dragons</a> of other worlds, their personalities, goals, and philosophies are quite different.</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Background.</b> In the beginning, the gods created good, evil, and neutrality. Conflict among the gods resulted in the All-Saints war, resolved when the good and neutral gods combined forces to prevent evil from claiming victory. Good, evil, and neutrality persist in Krynn to this day, and their balance is crucial to the harmony of all things.</p><p>The development of good, evil, and neutral dragons paralleled this balance. Just as the neutral gods joined forces with the gods of good, the neutral dragons aligned with the good dragons to thwart the plans of the evil dragons. However, the neutral dragons soon grew weary of being drawn into the endless conflicts between good and evil, and ultimately most of them abandoned Krynn.</p><p>While little is known of the neutral dragons today, the influence of good and evil dragons remains strong. Black, blue, green, red, and white dragons invariably ally themselves with the forces of evil, while brass, bronze, copper, gold, and sliver dragons invariably ally themselves with the forces of good.</p><p>Three Dragonwars were fought during the Age of Dreams, the first era of Krynn. In the final Dragonwar, a young Knight of Solamnia named Huma was given the secret of the dragonlance, a powerful weapon capable of destroying dragons. Flying a silver dragon, he battled the evil dragons in the skies, and they were eventually defeated. To preserve the balance, the good dragons departed the world. For years afterwards, dragons were unknown on Krynn existing only as creatures of legend.</p><p>Following the Cataclysm (a world-wide disaster of unprecedented proportions in which the wrath of the gods descended on Krynn), Takhisis, the Queen of Darkness, awakened the evil dragons and took the eggs of the good dragons. The good dragons swore an oath not to interfere with the affairs of Krynn in exchange for their eggs safe-keeping, but Takhisis betrayed them by corrupting their eggs to create the <a href=\"/appendix/draconia\">draconians</a>. The good dragons discovered the Dark Queen's treachery and declared war on their evil cousins. Fighting side by side with the good people of Krynn, the good dragons eventually triumphed in the conflict that came to be known as the War of the Lance.</p><p>In the years following the War of the Lance, the good dragons seemingly disappeared again from the face of Krynn. In fact, many of the good dragons had succumbed to a mysterious disease, while others had been summoned to their ancestral home to defend against an anticipated attack. Taking advantage of the absence of good dragons, Takhisis made another attempt to conquer Krynn. But with the aid of the good people of Krynn, the good dragons were able to cure the disease that was killing them, secure their ancestral home, and rally their forces to stop Takhisis. Though the good dragons continue to persevere, their constant vigilance is required to hold the threat of evil in check.</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Dragons and Men.</b> Perhaps the most striking difference between the dragons of Krynn and the dragons of other worlds is their relationship with men and women. Where other dragons are reclusive and withdrawn, seldom involving themselves with the affairs of other races, the fates of Krynn dragons and Krynn men and women have been inexorably linked since the dawn of time. This is as true of the evil dragons as it of the good dragons. The evil dragons maintain close ties with evil humans and demihumans and have worked closely with them in the past to realize their common goals of conquest and subjugation. In turn, the good dragons ally themselves with the forces of good to counter the evil dragons and to further the causes of justice and honor.</p><p>Further, a mystical bond exists between good dragons and good people. This bond is based on mutual trust, respect, and cooperation. When the bond is strong, both dragons and people flourish, able to function at the peak of their talents and abilities. But when the bond is threatened by doubt, disrespect, or disharmony, both dragons and people suffer and regress.</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Dragon Culture.</b> The dragons of Krynn have a rich cultural heritage. Although this is not generally known to the human population of Krynn, brilliant dragon scholars have excelled over the ages in areas as diverse as astronomy, mathematics, history, and philosophy. There have even been a small but notable number of dragon artists who have created magnificent poetry, beautiful music, and stirring literature. Though the good dragons have especially strong academic and aesthetic talents, the evil dragons also have produced scholars and artists whose works rival those of any other race.</p><p>Dragons have an oral instead of a written tradition, and most of their philosophy, history, and literature is passed from generation to generation by word of mouth. But like other races with a rich culture, the dragons keep much of their heritage alive by preserving it in sculptures, paintings, and other works of art. These art works not only enrich the lives of the dragons with their sheer beauty, they also serve as permanent records of important ideas and events. They are among the dragons' greatest treasures.</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Age Categories and Die Modifiers:</b> Like the dragons of other worlds, the Hit Dice and combat modifiers of Krynn dragons vary among subspecies and are modified based on age category; this information is listed on the following Dragon Table. Combat modifiers apply to both attack and damage rolls for each physical attack, but these do not apply to a dragon's breath weapon. Saving throws are also tied to their Hit Dice: each dragon saves as a warrior equal in level to the dragon's Hit Dice. Krynn dragons' Hit Dice bases are identical to those of other worlds, as described on the entries for these dragons (see below for links). (For instance, a Krynn copper dragon and a Hit Dice base of 13, the same as his counterpart on other worlds. A hatchling copper dragon subtracts 6 dice, for a total of 7 Hit Dice; it saves as a 7th level warrior.)</p><p>Krynn dragons pass through the various age categories at a slightly slower rate than the dragons of other worlds, as shown on the Dragon Table. Though Krynn dragons cause fear in other creatures much like the dragons of other worlds, their fear auras are not as strong as those of other dragons; their fear radii and the modifiers affecting their victims' saving throws are summarized on the Dragon Table.</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Attacks and Defenses:</b> Krynn dragons have the same defense and attack abilities as their other-world counterparts, including spellcasting, breath weapons, physical dttacks. and enhanced senses.</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Traits:</b> Krynn dragons have the same characteristics, physical appearance, and statistics as their counterparts on other worlds. These similarities include alignment, Armor Class, treasure type, and experience points given in the subspecies listings (see below for links). Ecological details, such as those pertaining to their lairs, metabolisms, and families, are also similar, as are their general combat tactics. However, Krynn dragons have different attitudes and philosophies than dragons from other worlds; these differences are summarized below.</p>\r\n<h2>The Evil Dragons</h2>\r\n<p class=\"f\"><b>Black Dragons:</b> Impulsive and nervous, <a href=\"/appendix/dragcbla\">black dragons</a> tend to act first and think later. There are fewer black dragon scholars and artists than any other subspecies of Krynn dragon. Black dragons are extremely independent and ally with other races only if it serves their purposes; hence, they are seldom used by evil forces in times of war. Black dragons move silently and strike quickly. Their favorite spell is <i>darkness</i>, which is used to cover their movements during attacks.</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Blue Dragons:</b> Although <a href=\"/appendix/dragcblu\">blue dragons</a> live in caves, they prefer to dwell in deserts and arid lands. More gregarious than many of their cousins, blue dragons serve as line quality troops in times of warfare. Blue dragons believe they are the gods' favorites.</p><p>Blue dragons are wise enough to see the importance of cooperation, and thus are valued allies in times of warfare. Most dragonriders are mounted on blue dragons. The loyalty felt among the members of a blue dragon squad can be so profound that loss of a companion can plunge the survivors into deep depressions, sometimes to the point of hindering their effectiveness on the battlefield. Though highly adept spellcasters and skilled fighters with their teeth and claws, the blue dragons' favorite attack is their lighting breath.</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Green Dragons:</b> <a href=\"/appendix/dragcgre\">Green dragons</a> are notorious even among evil dragons for their cruel natures and vicious tempers. Green dragons have few concerns beyond their own immediate desires. Unabashed hedonists, they relish treasure, rich foods and sensual pleasures. They are clever and subtle combatants. Green dragons obey orders only from leaders whom they respect. A leader who loses the respect of a green dragon may soon find himself between the dragon's jaws.</p><p>Green dragons prefer to use trickery and magic on an enemy instead of an all-out assault, but they engage in bloody melee when necessary.</p><p>Green dragons are rarely used in major offensives, but are often used for assassinations and other sinister assignments.</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Red Dragons:</b> <a href=\"/appendix/dragcred\">Red dragons</a> are the strongest and most fearsome of all evil dragons. Their intelligence exceeds that of blue dragons. They cooperate with other dragons as necessary, but they refuse to obey orders with which they disagree. Red dragons see no grand design to the multiverse; to them, existence is a random mix of chaos and disorder in which only the strongest can survive.</p><p>Red dragons enjoy nothing more than setting cities ablaze, and then rummaging through the rubble for loot. Though leery of most leaders, they are loyal to the Queen of Darkness. Red dragons work well together. Unless it is in their best interest to take prisoners, red dragons hunt down and destroy their enemies to the last.</p><p class=\"f\"><b>White Dragons:</b> <a href=\"/appendix/dragcwhi\">White dragons</a> are the least able of all the evil aragons. They have little or no interest in art, and only a peripheral interest in the grand schemes of their evil cousins. In most cases, white dragons would prefer to be left alone. In times of war, white dragons are used as scouts or are assigned to defend regions of the least strategic importance. Though slow to react, white dragons can be effective fighters, relying heavily on their breath weapons to weaken opponents before closing to attack with their teeth and claws.</p>\r\n<h2>The Good Dragons</h2>\r\n<p class=\"f\"><b>Brass Dragons:</b> <a href=\"/appendix/dragmbra\">Brass dragons</a> believe that life is a series of tests and designed to weed out the weak from the strong. Though benevolent and understanding of creatures they consider to be inferior, brass dragons believe that ultimately the superior should be allowed to flourish. Generally considered to be the least sophisticated of all of the good dragons, brass dragons have little interest in art or culture, instead devoting themselves to developing strategies for dealing with the unavoidable hardships of existence. They are good fighters, preferring to attack with claws and teeth, reserving their breath weapons and spells for emergencies.</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Bronze Dragons:</b> <a href=\"/appendix/dragmbro\">Bronze dragons</a> are fond of war and fighting. Bronze dragons are also extremely interested in the affairs of mankind. In ancient times, bronze dragons were believed to take the forms of domestic animals simply to study the cultures of men.</p><p>Though not particularly deep thinkers, bronze dragons believe that concepts such as good and evil can be understood intuitively. Logic can actually impair understanding, since the universe is not a logical place.</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Copper Dragons:</b> <a href=\"/appendix/dragmcop\">Copper dragons</a> adhere to no particular philosophy and are easily influenced by the opinions of others. They are extremely fond of wealth, almost always demanding to know how cooperating with others will benefit them. They seldom make decisions of consequence without first consulting other dragons. In spite of their selfishness, copper dragons are basically kindhearted. They are loyal to their friends, but distrustful of strangers. In combat, they freely attack with both breath weapons.</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Gold Dragons:</b> Because of their devotion to the intellect, <a href=\"/appendix/dragmgol\">gold dragons</a> have produced many fine scholars, particularly in the fields of mathematics and philosophy. Though gold dragons respect all intelligent creatures regardless of their species, they rarely associate with other races - the arrogant gold dragons consider such associations to be demeaning. Gold dragons are extremely skilled in magic and prefer to attack with their spells.</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Silver Dragons:</b> <a href=\"/appendix/dragmsil\">Silver dragons</a> believe that the purpose of life is devotion to the standards of good. They believe in the sanctity of life and that all creatures are equal in the eyes of the gods. They go to war only reluctantly, but they are fully prepared to give their lives for a cause in which they believe.</p><p>Silver dragons are the dragons most beloved by the races of Krynn. They can polymorph into human or elven form and sometimes seem to prefer these forms to their own. They enjoy the company of humans and help them whenever they can.<br><br></p><table class=\"ip\"><caption>Dragon Table</caption><tr class=\"bk\"><th>Age Category</th><th>Age (in years)</th><th>Hit Die Modifier</th><th>Combat Modifier</th><th>Fear Radius</th><th>Fear Save Modifier</th></tr><tr><td>1 Hatchling</td><td>0-7</td><td>-6</td><td>+1</td><td>-</td><td>-</td></tr><tr><td>2 Very Young</td><td>8-20</td><td>-4</td><td>+2</td><td>-</td><td>-</td></tr><tr><td>3 Young</td><td>21-35</td><td>-2</td><td>+3</td><td>-</td><td>-</td></tr><tr><td>4 Juvenile</td><td>36-70</td><td>-1</td><td>+4</td><td>-</td><td>-</td></tr><tr><td>5 Young Adult</td><td>71-120</td><td>Nil</td><td>+ 5</td><td>10 yards</td><td>+4</td></tr><tr><td>6 Adult</td><td>121-250</td><td>+1</td><td>+6</td><td>15 yards</td><td>+3</td></tr><tr><td>7 Mature Adult</td><td>251-500</td><td>+2</td><td>+7</td><td>20 yards</td><td>+2</td></tr><tr><td>8 Old</td><td>501-750</td><td>+3</td><td>+8</td><td>25 yards</td><td>+1</td></tr><tr><td>9 Very Old</td><td>751-1,000</td><td>+4</td><td>+9</td><td>30 yards</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>10 Venerable</td><td>1,001-1,200</td><td>+5</td><td>+10</td><td>35 yards</td><td>-1</td></tr><tr><td>11 Wyrm</td><td>1,201-1,400</td><td>+6</td><td>+11</td><td>40 yards</td><td>-2</td></tr><tr><td>12 Great Wyrm</td><td>1,401+</td><td>+7</td><td>+12</td><td>45 yards</td><td>-3</td></tr></table><br clear=\"all\" style=\"clear:both; height:0;\">\r\n","images":["<img src=\"grf/dl.gif\" width=\"150\" height=\"75\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Dragonlance\" title=\"Dragonlance\" align=\"right\">","<img src=\"grf/add2_01.gif\" width=\"200\" height=\"56\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Advanced Dungeons & Dragons 2nd Edition\">"],"setting":"Dragonlance","title":"Dragon (Krynn), General Information"},"sources":["2105"],"statblock_names":[],"title":"Dragon (Krynn), General Information","prev_key":"dragkrot","next_key":"draglcot","monster_path":"/appendix/dragkryn"}},"staticQueryHashes":[],"slicesMap":{}}
