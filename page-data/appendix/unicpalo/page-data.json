Their eyes are usually gray to brown in color.</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Combat:</b> Palomino unicorns (occasionally called &ldquo;criocorns&rdquo;) can use the following spells each once per day: <i>ice storm</i>, <i>cone of cold</i>, <i>chill metal</i>. These spells are cast at the 11th level of effect. These spell effects generally emanate from the unicorn's horn. Criocorns are immune to the effects of cold and exposure, either magical and mundane.</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Habitat/Society:</b> Palomino unicorns mate for life, though a few solitary wanderers may be seen. They are found in arctic environments, giving opponents a -6 penalty to their rolls to be surprised in that environment due to coloration (this drops to -2 in other settings, as palomino unicorns will be so unused to non-snowy terrain). Criocorns may be ridden by exceptionally evil females who have an affinity for cold magic or who worship a god of cold.</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Ecology:</b> Palominos live off anything they can find or kill. They do not mark their territory, but will kill any who trespass. A palomino's horn can be used to create the ink necessary to produce scrolls of <i>protection from cold</i>.</p><br clear=\"all\" style=\"clear:both; height:0;\">\r\n","images":["<img src=\"grf/dr.gif\" width=\"150\" height=\"75\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Dragon Magazine\" title=\"Dragon Magazine\" align=\"right\">","<img src=\"grf/add2_01.gif\" width=\"200\" height=\"56\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Advanced Dungeons & Dragons 2nd Edition\">"],"setting":"Dragon Magazine","statblock":{"Unicorn, Palomino":{"Activity Cycle":"Day","Alignment":"Lawful evil","Armor Class":"1","Climate/Terrain":"Arctic/Tundra","Damage/Attack":"1-8/1-8/1-10","Diet":"Omnivore","Frequency":"Very rare","Hit Dice":"5+4","Intelligence":"Low (5-7)","Magic Resistance":"Nil","Morale":"Elite (13-14)","Movement":"24","No. Appearing":"1-4","No. of Attacks":"3","Organization":"Family","Size":"L","Special Attacks":"See below","Special Defenses":"See below","THAC0":"15","Treasure":"W","XP Value":"1,400"}},"title":"Unicorn, Palomino"},"sources":["Dragon#190"],"statblock_names":[],"title":"Unicorn, Palomino","prev_key":"unicorn","next_key":"unicpint"}},"staticQueryHashes":[],"slicesMap":{}}
