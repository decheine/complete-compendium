While the powers listed above are the most common, some aarakocra have different or additional powers.</p><p class=\"f\">A race of intelligent, birdlike creatures living in the deepest deserts of Athas, the rare Athasian <a href=\"/appendix/aarakocr\">aarakocra</a> spends its time soaring on thermals in search of food.</p><p>The aarakocra is 7 to 8 feet tall with a wingspan of 20 feet or more. Because of its large wingspan, an aarakocra can carry as much as 75% of its own body weight and still fly easily. An aarakocra can fly a short distance carrying a burden equaling 125% of its own body weight. The average body weight of a full grown male is 100 pounds and a female is 85 pounds.</p><p>Each wing has a &ldquo;hand&rdquo; at its midpoint, consisting of three fingers and an opposable thumb. The fourth finger forms the rigid leading edge of the wing. In flight the hands cannot be used, but on the ground the aarakocra can use its hands almost as a human would. The aarakocra's body is protected by a thin bony plate on the chest, much like a solid rib cage. Talons on its legs can be used as claws and can be retracted to reveal a second set of hands, also with three fingers and an opposable thumb. Except for the chest plate, the entire skeleton is hollow and extremely fragile.</p><p>From a distance, the Athasian aarakocra resembles a huge <a href=\"/appendix/bird\">vulture</a>. Its black eyes, set in the front of the head, provide excellent vision over a long range. The plumage is generally black with a white collar for adult males and black or brown with a smaller white collar for females. Adolescents are a mixture of brown and black. The beak is large and covers most of the head. Plumage begins at the crown of the head and is darker near the head, except for the collar. Athasian aarakocra speak their own language and the languages of vultures and other large birds. Some speak the common tongue (5% to 10% chance depending on how deep in the wastelands a tribe lives).</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Combat:</b> Aarakocra can fight in the air or on the ground. They prefer aerial combat since their bones are too fragile to withstand a solid blow from a human-sized opponent. In combat against creatures on the ground, they prefer to fly over their victim and drop weighted nets. Some aarakocra use darts to harass ground-based opponents.</p><p>If their opponents can fly, the aarakocra generally forgo the use of the net, although large groups sometimes use nets on flying creatures. Normally, aarakocra attack flying creatures with long spears, diving from above and allowing the momentum to carry the spear through the target. Such an attack doubles the damage if the aarakocra have been able to dive at least 50 feet. Only the very largest aarakocra can carry more than one of these spears, they can attack with both at once with no penalty, causing double damage on each strike. All diving attacks are made at +4 and should be treated as a charge attack. All other penalties and restrictions of charge attacks apply.</p><p>The effect of the aarakocra's nets depends on if the opponent is flying at the time it becomes entangled. Creatures on the ground that are hit by a net are entangled and unable to participate in any combat until they make a successful Strength check to get free of the net. Flying creatures hit by a net can no longer fly and immediately begin falling. If they cannot escape the net or use some magical means to arrest the fall, normal falling damage applies.</p><p>Unless victims are entangled in nets, aarakocra are cautious in ground combat. If the aarakocra outnumber their opponents they advance in a straight line and thrust with their spears. If outnumbered, or the opponents are particularly tough, the aarakocra withdraw. Victims entangled in nets are killed or incapacitated for use as food or ransom.</p><p>Athasian aarakocra are mindful of their physical limitations as well as their comparatively low psionic abilities. They do not normally initiate psionic combat. At the first sign of psionic powers from any of their victims, however, all aarakocra that have some ability will use whatever attack and defense modes they can in an attempt to destroy the threat. Large groups of is or more aarakocra may initiate psionic combat if their leaders feel they can win quickly and avoid physical combat.</p><p>In desperation, an aarakocra can attempt to bite an opponent in combat. Because of the unwieldiness of its beak, the aarakocra has a THAC0 of 18 if attacking with this appendage. Further, the birdman causes only 1d2 points of damage with the beak.</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Habitat/Society:</b> Athasian aarakocra live in tribes with 6-20 (2d8+4) members, depending on the prestige of the leader. The largest tribe ever recorded had 50 members. The tribal hunting territory depends on the size of the tribe, usually about 500 square miles for a tribe of 10 members. There are no rigid boundaries between tribes and border disputes are not uncommon.</p><p>Alignments of tribe members are similar to the alignment of the leader. A tribe that has a leader who is neutral good may have neutral good, chaotic good, lawful good, and true neutral members. A predominantly evil tribe does not recognize boundaries with other tribes and treats other tribes as inferior beings to be eliminated.</p><p>Athasian aarakocra aren't happy in enclosed spaces, but they they take refuge in a cave or building if necessary.</p><p>Nonevil tribes live in rocky aeries in the highest peaks they can find. Evil tribes are normally nomadic and use an aerie made by another tribe if they need to remain in an area for a long time, even if they have to evict the tribe that made the nest.</p><p>Aarakocra aren't friendly toward intruders in their territory, especially caravans. They try to extract a toll from the caravan for passage through the desert. Good-aligned tribes allow unhindered passage of caravans that pay a tribute. If someone refuses to pay the tribute, the aarakocra try to capture scouts or outriders from the party and hold them until an even larger tribute is paid. The payment may be either livestock or shiny objects. Aarakocra are smart enough not to be taken in by glass baubles instead of gems, although they cannot tell the difference between the more common gems and the rare ones.</p><p>Evil tribes ask for tribute and often attack a caravan whether it pays or not. Aarakocra always demand shiny objects such as stones. These tribes find humans and demihumans to be quite tasty and prefer them to other food.</p><p>Good-aligned tribes of aarakocra sometimes return a lost traveler to the edge of the desert after first removing any valuables the traveler may be carrying. On very rare occasions a tribe might return a lost group of travelers to the more frequently traveled parts of the desert, again after first taking any valuables as payment.</p><p>The oldest male is the leader of the tribal hunting party and has 4+4 Hit Dice. The oldest female is in charge of the tribal aerie and has 3+3 HD. In tribes that have more than 15 members, the next oldest aarakocra serves as shaman and has 3+3 HD; the shaman completes the triumvirate necessary for proper worship and the summoning of elementals. (Interestingly, no magic-using aarakocra has ever been recorded.) Tribes without a shaman cannot summon <a href=\"/appendix/element1\">air elementals</a>, which is an important part of aarakocra culture.</p><p>The shaman is the leader of the daily sun worship. Aarakocra worship the sun because it provides them with the thermals they need to soar in search of food. The shaman also leads the mystic rituals used to summon an air elemental. Summoning an air elemental is usually done only in preparation for the tribe's most sacred ceremony, the hunt. Small tribes must band together for this ceremony to allow the triumvirate to be formed.</p><p>The ceremony to summon an air elemental must be conducted at dawn and requires the oldest male and female to emit a highpitched keening whistle. The shaman conducts an intricate dance around them, simultaneously chanting an ancient summoning mantra.</p><p>The hunt is the final part of the initiation of adolescent aarakocra to adulthood and often takes the tribe far from their normal teritory. The target is always a <a href=\"/appendix/drakalsi\">silt drake</a>. The hunt is the only time the females leave the relative safety of the nest. Even an evil tribe will not interfere with a tribe on a hunt. An air elemental is often summoned to help find the drake, but never takes part in the actual combat. Although the adult members of the tribe take part in the initial phases of the combat, it is the initiates who deliver the final, killing blows to me drake. Scars from the hunt are considered a mark of pride among all aarakocra.</p><p>The females spend about eight months of the year incubating their eggs. Athasian aarakocra mate for life and a pair normally produces as many as 10 offspring. A female lays one egg a year. Constant incubation is not required because of the high daytime temperatures, so the females can maintain the nest and keep the tribe's treasure in order.</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Ecology:</b> Athasian aarakocra are high on the food chain and have no natural enemies other than <a href=\"/appendix/drakatha\">drakes</a>. Unless evil, aarakocra leave their own territory only to hunt the silt drake and return as soon as possible when the hunt is over. (Evil aarakocra attack others, as noted above.) Aarakocra eggs and hatchlings are sought after by wealthy land owners who wish to use the creatures as scouts and sentries. An egg can bring as much as 10 cp in Tyr's marketplace. Tribes that have had eggs or hatchlings stolen have long memories and sometimes take revenge against the thief at a later date. Captive aarakocra join any tribe they come in contact with.</p><p>Athasian aarakocra have a natural life span of 21-30 years.</p><p></p><br clear=\"all\" style=\"clear:both; height:0;\">\r\n","images":["<img src=\"grf/ds.gif\" width=\"150\" height=\"75\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Dark Sun\" title=\"Dark Sun\" align=\"right\">","<img src=\"img/aarakath.gif\" alt=\"Aarakocra (Athas)\" title=\"Aarakocra (Athas)\" border=\"0\" width=\"300\" height=\"360\" style=\"text-align:right;\" align=\"right\">","<img src=\"grf/add2_01.gif\" width=\"200\" height=\"56\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Advanced Dungeons & Dragons 2nd Edition\">"],"setting":"Dark Sun","statblock":{"Aarakocra (Athas)":{"Activity Cycle":"Day","Alignment":"Any","Armor Class":"7","Climate/Terrain":"Deep desert","Damage/Attack":"1d3/1d3 or by weapon","Diet":"Carnivore","Frequency":"Rare","Hit Dice":"2+2","Intelligence":"Average (8-10)","Magic Resistance":"Nil","Morale":"Steady (11)","Movement":"6, Fl 36 (C)","No. Appearing":"1d10","No. of Attacks":"2","Organization":"Tribal","Size":"M (20'+ wingspan)","Special Attacks":"Nil","Special Defenses":"Nil","THAC0":"17","Treasure":"Varies","XP Value":"65"}},"title":"Aarakocra (Athas)"},"sources":["2433"],"statblock_names":[],"title":"Aarakocra (Athas)","prev_key":"zygraat","next_key":"aarakocr","monster_path":"/appendix/aarakath"}}},"pageContext":{"monster_key":"xagya","monster_data":{"TSR":["2635"],"fullBody":"  <table cellspacing=\"0\" cellpadding=\"0\"><tr><th>Climate/Terrain:</th><td>Energy Planes</td></tr><tr><th>Frequency:</th><td>Uncommon</td></tr><tr><th>Organization:</th><td>Solitary</td></tr><tr><th>Activity Cycle:</th><td>Any</td></tr><tr><th>Diet:</th><td>Energy</td></tr><tr><th>Intelligence:</th><td>High (13-14)</td></tr><tr><th>Treasure:</th><td>Nil</td></tr><tr><th>Alignment:</th><td>Neutral</td></tr><tr><th>No. Appearing:</th><td>1</td></tr><tr><th>Armor Class:</th><td>0</td></tr><tr><th>Movement:</th><td>Fl 6 (B)</td></tr><tr><th>Hit Dice:</th><td>5-8</td></tr><tr><th>THAC0:</th><td>5-6 HD: 15<br>7-8 HD: 13</td></tr><tr><th>No. of Attacks:</th><td>1</td></tr><tr><th>Damage/Attack:</th><td>1d6+6</td></tr><tr><th>Special Attacks:</th><td>Energy blast or drain</td></tr><tr><th>Special Defenses:</th><td>See below</td></tr><tr><th>Magic Resistance:</th><td>15%</td></tr><tr><th>Size:</th><td>M (4' diameter)</td></tr><tr><th>Morale:</th><td>Steady (11)</td></tr><tr><th>XP Value:</th><td>5 HD: 5,000<br>6 HD: 6,000<br>7 HD: 7.000<br>8 HD: 8.000</td></tr></table><p class=\"f\">Ah, life &ndash; there's no spot in the multiverse where it hasn't managed to take hold. Perhaps, in a tome dedicated to the creatures of the inhospitable Inner Planes, such a concept should be a theme, or even <i>the</i> theme. There's life everywhere.</p><p>The Positive and Negative Energy Planes are no exception to this rule. Somehow, on both of these seething planes of force, consciousnesses formed and adopted bodies made of the essence around them. The Positive Energy Plane - a brilliant sea of explosive vitality - spawned the creature known as the xag-ya, whereas the Negative Energy Plane - a cold pit of devouring darkness - brought forth the xeg-yi.</p><p>On the other hand, some say that neither creature is a true native of its plane at all. These folks claim that the xag-ya and xeg-yi came into existence elsewhere (perhaps on the same plane, perhaps on different planes), forming in isolated pockets of positive and negative energy. The beasts might even have been created by some intelligent agency for an unknown purpose.'Course, this is just idle speculation, but it comes about for a very good reason. The Positive Energy Plane is practically life incarnate. How could a creature attain enough true individuality in such a place to achieve consciousness and an ambulatory body? And the Negative Energy Plane is as antilife as a basher can conceive, which makes the idea of a living creature of negative energy seem a bit of a contradiction.</p><p>The graybeards can rattle their bone-boxes all they like about these problems, but the fact is that no one really knows how or why the xag-ya and the xeg-yi exist. The two creatures are similar and yet opposite in appearance and nature - so much so that it makes a body wonder if their geneses didn't have something in common.</p><p>In any event, both are spherical beings with multiple tendrils of energy writhing about them, almost like the tentacles of an octopus. Each creature's main body is a globe of energy that's unremarkable except for two narrow spots that suggest eyes. These eyes, in turn, suggest an unknowable and alien intelligence. At first glance, there's only one way to tell the two creatures apart: The xag-ya appears silvery and lustrous, while its negative counterpart is black and dull.</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Combat:</b> Both monsters attack foes by striking with their whiplike tendrils of energy. The touch of the xag-ya carries with it a powerful jolt that overloads living creatures and causes them 1d6+6 points of damage. Combustible, nonliving items such as paper, cloth, and wood catch on fire when exposed to this raw force.</p><p>Every other round, the xag-ya can fire a bolt of this cnergy at a target up to 10 feet away. Like the touch of the creature's tendrils, the bolt ignites combustibles and inflicts 1d6+6 points of damage, but it also heats metal objects. Such items glow white-hot and remain so for 1d4 rounds. During that time, they cause 1d4 points of damage per round to anyone in contact with them. Magical metallic items are allowcd a saving throw versus electricity to resist being heated.</p><p>The life-draining tendrils of the xeg-yi corrode whatever they touch. They inflict 1d6+6 points of damagc on living targets and cause nonliving items such as paper, cloth, and wood to age and rot.</p><p>Every other rotund, the xeg-yi can discharge a bolt of negative energy with a range of 10 feet. It has the same effect as the touch of a tendril, corroding materials and inflicting 1d6+6 points of damage, but it also rots sturdy materials like metal and stone. Such items must make a successful saving throw versus electricity or become corroded and worthless.</p><p>A basher's got to have a weapon of +1 or better enchantment in order to harm either creature. And rather than discuss what kind of magic the pair is immune to, it's easier to list the few spells that do affect them. Xag-ya are vulnerable to cold-based spells, while xeg-yi are harmed by magical fire. Both are subject to <i>disintegration</i> and <i>magic missile</i>, and neither can penetrate a <i>shield</i> spell. If a cutter runs into either monster elsewhere in the multiverse, he can send it back to its home plane with one of the following spells: <i>abjure</i>, <i>banishment</i>, <i>dismissal</i>, <i>dispel magic</i> (treat the level of magic as twice the creature's Hit Dice total), <i>holy word</i>, <i>limited wish</i>, <i>plane shift</i>, or <i>wish</i>. No other spells can affect them.</p><p>A <i>rod of absorption</i> or a <i>wand of negation</i> can thwart the attack of a xag-ya, while a <i>rod of cancellation</i> or a <i>mace of disruption</i> provides protection from the assaults of a xeg-yi. What's more, these four magical items can't be harmed by either creature.</p><p>If a xag-ya or xeg-yi is slain, it explodes in the appropriate release of energy &ndash; either an overloading jolt or an enervating drain). This burst has a radius of 10 feet, and all within the area suffer 2d6+12 points of damage. Victims and objects are also affected as if struck by a bolt of energy loosed by the creature (thus, certain items must make saving throws).</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Habitat/Society:</b> Neither the xag-ya nor the xeg-yi seems to interact with other creatures &ndash; not even those of their own kind. Though they're thought to be highly intelligent, they have no language or real means of communication. They're completely solitary beings. Still, they're also quite curious about what lies beyond their own planes and oftcn wander about the multiverse, observing.</p><p>While they're not outright hostile, their touch endangers virtually all things, so it's inevitable that they find themselves in combat fairly often &ndash; others can't help but perceive them as a threat.</p><p>Should a xag-ya and a xeg-yi ever meet, they instantly rush toward each other. If they come into contact, they annihilate themselves in a conflagration of energy that inflicts 4d6+24 points of damage to every living thing in a 30-foot radius. The blast randomly corrodes or heats nonliving objects within this area. No one knows exactly why the creatures do this; some bloods believe it0146s motivated by hatred, while others think it's due to some other need or flaw.</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Ecology:</b> Xag-ya and xeg-yi feed on all sorts of energy. Their means of reproduction is unknown but must be asexual - after all, individuals of these species never interact.</p><p></p><br clear=\"all\" style=\"clear:both; height:0;\">\r\n","images":["<img src=\"grf/ps.gif\" width=\"150\" height=\"75\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Planescape\" title=\"Planescape\" align=\"right\">","<img src=\"img/xagya.gif\" alt=\"Xag-Ya/Xeg-Yi\" title=\"Xag-Ya/Xeg-Yi\" border=\"0\" width=\"300\" height=\"360\" style=\"text-align:right;\" align=\"right\">","<img src=\"grf/add2_01.gif\" width=\"200\" height=\"56\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Advanced Dungeons & Dragons 2nd Edition\">"],"setting":"Planescape","statblock":{"Xag-Ya/Xeg-Yi":{"Activity Cycle":"Any","Alignment":"Neutral","Armor Class":"0","Climate/Terrain":"Energy Planes","Damage/Attack":"1d6+6","Diet":"Energy","Frequency":"Uncommon","Hit Dice":"5-8","Intelligence":"High (13-14)","Magic Resistance":"15%","Morale":"Steady (11)","Movement":"Fl 6 (B)","No. Appearing":"1","No. of Attacks":"1","Organization":"Solitary","Size":"M (4' diameter)","Special Attacks":"Energy blast or drain","Special Defenses":"See below","THAC0":"5-6 HD: 15<br>7-8 HD: 13","Treasure":"Nil","XP Value":"5 HD: 5,000<br>6 HD: 6,000<br>7 HD: 7.000<br>8 HD: 8.000"}},"title":"Xag-Ya/Xeg-Yi"},"sources":["2635"],"statblock_names":[],"title":"Xag-Ya/Xeg-Yi","prev_key":"wyvern","next_key":"xantrava","monster_path":"/appendix/xagya"}},"staticQueryHashes":[],"slicesMap":{}}
