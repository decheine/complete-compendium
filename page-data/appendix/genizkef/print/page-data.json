While the powers listed above are the most common, some aarakocra have different or additional powers.</p><p class=\"f\">A race of intelligent, birdlike creatures living in the deepest deserts of Athas, the rare Athasian <a href=\"/appendix/aarakocr\">aarakocra</a> spends its time soaring on thermals in search of food.</p><p>The aarakocra is 7 to 8 feet tall with a wingspan of 20 feet or more. Because of its large wingspan, an aarakocra can carry as much as 75% of its own body weight and still fly easily. An aarakocra can fly a short distance carrying a burden equaling 125% of its own body weight. The average body weight of a full grown male is 100 pounds and a female is 85 pounds.</p><p>Each wing has a &ldquo;hand&rdquo; at its midpoint, consisting of three fingers and an opposable thumb. The fourth finger forms the rigid leading edge of the wing. In flight the hands cannot be used, but on the ground the aarakocra can use its hands almost as a human would. The aarakocra's body is protected by a thin bony plate on the chest, much like a solid rib cage. Talons on its legs can be used as claws and can be retracted to reveal a second set of hands, also with three fingers and an opposable thumb. Except for the chest plate, the entire skeleton is hollow and extremely fragile.</p><p>From a distance, the Athasian aarakocra resembles a huge <a href=\"/appendix/bird\">vulture</a>. Its black eyes, set in the front of the head, provide excellent vision over a long range. The plumage is generally black with a white collar for adult males and black or brown with a smaller white collar for females. Adolescents are a mixture of brown and black. The beak is large and covers most of the head. Plumage begins at the crown of the head and is darker near the head, except for the collar. Athasian aarakocra speak their own language and the languages of vultures and other large birds. Some speak the common tongue (5% to 10% chance depending on how deep in the wastelands a tribe lives).</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Combat:</b> Aarakocra can fight in the air or on the ground. They prefer aerial combat since their bones are too fragile to withstand a solid blow from a human-sized opponent. In combat against creatures on the ground, they prefer to fly over their victim and drop weighted nets. Some aarakocra use darts to harass ground-based opponents.</p><p>If their opponents can fly, the aarakocra generally forgo the use of the net, although large groups sometimes use nets on flying creatures. Normally, aarakocra attack flying creatures with long spears, diving from above and allowing the momentum to carry the spear through the target. Such an attack doubles the damage if the aarakocra have been able to dive at least 50 feet. Only the very largest aarakocra can carry more than one of these spears, they can attack with both at once with no penalty, causing double damage on each strike. All diving attacks are made at +4 and should be treated as a charge attack. All other penalties and restrictions of charge attacks apply.</p><p>The effect of the aarakocra's nets depends on if the opponent is flying at the time it becomes entangled. Creatures on the ground that are hit by a net are entangled and unable to participate in any combat until they make a successful Strength check to get free of the net. Flying creatures hit by a net can no longer fly and immediately begin falling. If they cannot escape the net or use some magical means to arrest the fall, normal falling damage applies.</p><p>Unless victims are entangled in nets, aarakocra are cautious in ground combat. If the aarakocra outnumber their opponents they advance in a straight line and thrust with their spears. If outnumbered, or the opponents are particularly tough, the aarakocra withdraw. Victims entangled in nets are killed or incapacitated for use as food or ransom.</p><p>Athasian aarakocra are mindful of their physical limitations as well as their comparatively low psionic abilities. They do not normally initiate psionic combat. At the first sign of psionic powers from any of their victims, however, all aarakocra that have some ability will use whatever attack and defense modes they can in an attempt to destroy the threat. Large groups of is or more aarakocra may initiate psionic combat if their leaders feel they can win quickly and avoid physical combat.</p><p>In desperation, an aarakocra can attempt to bite an opponent in combat. Because of the unwieldiness of its beak, the aarakocra has a THAC0 of 18 if attacking with this appendage. Further, the birdman causes only 1d2 points of damage with the beak.</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Habitat/Society:</b> Athasian aarakocra live in tribes with 6-20 (2d8+4) members, depending on the prestige of the leader. The largest tribe ever recorded had 50 members. The tribal hunting territory depends on the size of the tribe, usually about 500 square miles for a tribe of 10 members. There are no rigid boundaries between tribes and border disputes are not uncommon.</p><p>Alignments of tribe members are similar to the alignment of the leader. A tribe that has a leader who is neutral good may have neutral good, chaotic good, lawful good, and true neutral members. A predominantly evil tribe does not recognize boundaries with other tribes and treats other tribes as inferior beings to be eliminated.</p><p>Athasian aarakocra aren't happy in enclosed spaces, but they they take refuge in a cave or building if necessary.</p><p>Nonevil tribes live in rocky aeries in the highest peaks they can find. Evil tribes are normally nomadic and use an aerie made by another tribe if they need to remain in an area for a long time, even if they have to evict the tribe that made the nest.</p><p>Aarakocra aren't friendly toward intruders in their territory, especially caravans. They try to extract a toll from the caravan for passage through the desert. Good-aligned tribes allow unhindered passage of caravans that pay a tribute. If someone refuses to pay the tribute, the aarakocra try to capture scouts or outriders from the party and hold them until an even larger tribute is paid. The payment may be either livestock or shiny objects. Aarakocra are smart enough not to be taken in by glass baubles instead of gems, although they cannot tell the difference between the more common gems and the rare ones.</p><p>Evil tribes ask for tribute and often attack a caravan whether it pays or not. Aarakocra always demand shiny objects such as stones. These tribes find humans and demihumans to be quite tasty and prefer them to other food.</p><p>Good-aligned tribes of aarakocra sometimes return a lost traveler to the edge of the desert after first removing any valuables the traveler may be carrying. On very rare occasions a tribe might return a lost group of travelers to the more frequently traveled parts of the desert, again after first taking any valuables as payment.</p><p>The oldest male is the leader of the tribal hunting party and has 4+4 Hit Dice. The oldest female is in charge of the tribal aerie and has 3+3 HD. In tribes that have more than 15 members, the next oldest aarakocra serves as shaman and has 3+3 HD; the shaman completes the triumvirate necessary for proper worship and the summoning of elementals. (Interestingly, no magic-using aarakocra has ever been recorded.) Tribes without a shaman cannot summon <a href=\"/appendix/element1\">air elementals</a>, which is an important part of aarakocra culture.</p><p>The shaman is the leader of the daily sun worship. Aarakocra worship the sun because it provides them with the thermals they need to soar in search of food. The shaman also leads the mystic rituals used to summon an air elemental. Summoning an air elemental is usually done only in preparation for the tribe's most sacred ceremony, the hunt. Small tribes must band together for this ceremony to allow the triumvirate to be formed.</p><p>The ceremony to summon an air elemental must be conducted at dawn and requires the oldest male and female to emit a highpitched keening whistle. The shaman conducts an intricate dance around them, simultaneously chanting an ancient summoning mantra.</p><p>The hunt is the final part of the initiation of adolescent aarakocra to adulthood and often takes the tribe far from their normal teritory. The target is always a <a href=\"/appendix/drakalsi\">silt drake</a>. The hunt is the only time the females leave the relative safety of the nest. Even an evil tribe will not interfere with a tribe on a hunt. An air elemental is often summoned to help find the drake, but never takes part in the actual combat. Although the adult members of the tribe take part in the initial phases of the combat, it is the initiates who deliver the final, killing blows to me drake. Scars from the hunt are considered a mark of pride among all aarakocra.</p><p>The females spend about eight months of the year incubating their eggs. Athasian aarakocra mate for life and a pair normally produces as many as 10 offspring. A female lays one egg a year. Constant incubation is not required because of the high daytime temperatures, so the females can maintain the nest and keep the tribe's treasure in order.</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Ecology:</b> Athasian aarakocra are high on the food chain and have no natural enemies other than <a href=\"/appendix/drakatha\">drakes</a>. Unless evil, aarakocra leave their own territory only to hunt the silt drake and return as soon as possible when the hunt is over. (Evil aarakocra attack others, as noted above.) Aarakocra eggs and hatchlings are sought after by wealthy land owners who wish to use the creatures as scouts and sentries. An egg can bring as much as 10 cp in Tyr's marketplace. Tribes that have had eggs or hatchlings stolen have long memories and sometimes take revenge against the thief at a later date. Captive aarakocra join any tribe they come in contact with.</p><p>Athasian aarakocra have a natural life span of 21-30 years.</p>\n","images":["<img src=\"grf/ds.gif\" width=\"150\" height=\"75\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Dark Sun\" title=\"Dark Sun\" align=\"right\">","<img src=\"img/aarakath.gif\" alt=\"Aarakocra (Athas)\" title=\"Aarakocra (Athas)\" border=\"0\" width=\"300\" height=\"360\" style=\"text-align:right;\" align=\"right\">","<img src=\"grf/add2_01.gif\" width=\"200\" height=\"56\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Advanced Dungeons & Dragons 2nd Edition\">"],"setting":"Dark Sun","statblock":{"Aarakocra (Athas)":{"Activity Cycle":"Day","Alignment":"Any","Armor Class":"7","Climate/Terrain":"Deep desert","Damage/Attack":"1d3/1d3 or by weapon","Diet":"Carnivore","Frequency":"Rare","Hit Dice":"2+2","Intelligence":"Average (8-10)","Magic Resistance":"Nil","Morale":"Steady (11)","Movement":"6, Fl 36 (C)","No. Appearing":"1d10","No. of Attacks":"2","Organization":"Tribal","Size":"M (20'+ wingspan)","Special Attacks":"Nil","Special Defenses":"Nil","THAC0":"17","Treasure":"Varies","XP Value":"65"}},"title":"Aarakocra (Athas)"},"sources":["2433"],"statblock_names":[],"title":"Aarakocra (Athas)","prev_key":"zygraat","next_key":"aarakocr","monster_path":"/appendix/aarakath"}}},"pageContext":{"monster_key":"genizkef","monster_data":{"TSR":["1077"],"fullBody":"  <table cellspacing=\"0\" cellpadding=\"0\"><tr><th>Climate/Terrain:</th><td>Fire, desert</td></tr><tr><th>Frequency:</th><td>Very rare</td></tr><tr><th>Organization:</th><td>Sultanate</td></tr><tr><th>Activity Cycle:</th><td>Day</td></tr><tr><th>Diet:</th><td>Omnivore</td></tr><tr><th>Intelligence:</th><td>Very (11-12)</td></tr><tr><th>Treasure:</th><td>F</td></tr><tr><th>Alignment:</th><td>Neutral</td></tr><tr><th>No. Appearing:</th><td>1</td></tr><tr><th>Armor Class:</th><td>2</td></tr><tr><th>Movement:</th><td>9, Fl 24 (B)</td></tr><tr><th>Hit Dice:</th><td>10</td></tr><tr><th>THAC0:</th><td>11</td></tr><tr><th>No. of Attacks:</th><td>1</td></tr><tr><th>Damage/Attack:</th><td>3-24 (3d8)</td></tr><tr><th>Special Attacks:</th><td>See below</td></tr><tr><th>Special Defenses:</th><td>Fire resistance; see below</td></tr><tr><th>Magic Resistance:</th><td>Nil</td></tr><tr><th>Size:</th><td>L (12 ft. tall)</td></tr><tr><th>Morale:</th><td>Champion (15-16)</td></tr><tr><th>XP Value:</th><td>7,000</td></tr></table><p class=\"f\">Ereet are genies of the Elemental Plane of Fire, and they are likely to found in great numbers there. ( <i>Efreet</i> is plural; <i>efreeti</i> is singular.) In the Land of Fate, they are usually alone, although they may be acting on behalf of a sha'ir or another master. These from equal parts of basalt, bronze, solid flame, and anger. Their genies are usually hostile and derogatory toward mortals, with two exceptions: mortals who are more powerful than the efreet, and skin color ranges from deep red or crimson to the dark gray and characters who are wise enough to realize the superiority of efreet over all other genies. As a race, efreet are insulted to the point of ebony of basalt. (Some Zakharans believe that creatures with red violence by suggestions that they are evil and lawful in nature. They prefer to think of themselves as fair, even-handed, well skin are chosen by Fate for a special task.) An efreeti's hair often organized, and possessing an enlightened sense of self-interest. seems aflame with its brassy undertones and red and smoky highlights. A red or black beard, either contrasting or matching (The rulers of the efreet, however, are both evil and lawful in nature.)</p>\n<p class=\"f\">Efreet are massive, solid, hulking humanoids with red eyes that flicker and glow like embers. It is said the efreet are configured from equal parts of basalt, bronze, solid flame, and anger. Their skin color ranges from deep red or crimson to the dark gray and ebony of basalt. (Some Zakharans believe that creatures with red skin are chosen by Fate for a special task.) An efreeti's hair often seems aflame with its brassy undertones and red and smoky highlights. A red or black beard, either contrasting or matching the hair, completes the visage of some males. These fiery genies dress in the finest silk caftans and damask robes, all dyed in shades of red and black. They also favor brass and gold jewelry.\n</p>\n<p class=\"f\"> Like most other genies, efreet have a limited form of telepathy, which enables them to converse with any being of low intelligence or better. (An efreeti is an unreliable translator, however, prone to twist the truth to its own ends.) Efreet also speak Midani and the native tongue shared by all geniekind. The efreeti dialect of the latter is harsh and passionate, with over-stressed syllables and a clipped, precise rhythm.</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Combat:</b> An efreeti can use each of these spell-like abilities once per day with the skill of a 15th-level wizard: become <i>invisible</i>,<i> assume gaseous form</i>, <i>detect magic</i>, <i>polymorph self</i>, create a <i>wall of fire</i>, and create an <i>illusion</i>. Illusions can have both visible and audible components, and they last without an efreeti's concentration until they are magically dispelled or touched.</p><p class=\"f\"> As often as desired, an efreeti can also <i>produce flame</i> or cause <i>pyrotechnics</i> (as a 15th-level wizard). In addition, the efreeti can <i>enlarge</i> itself once each day, with the skill of a 10th-level mage.</p><p class=\"f\"> Efreeti are fire-resistant. \"Normal\" fire-including incendiary attacks and the effects of their own native plane-cannot harm them. Nor can dragon breath. Magical fire-such as a <i>fireball</i> or similar magic from the province of flame-has diminished effects. Such magical attacks suffer a -1 penalty to hit the efreeti (where applicable), as well as a -1 penalty to each die of damage.</p><p class=\"f\"> The efreeti' s most renowned power is the granting of wishes (per the spell), up to three per day. This ability has made efreet very popular among those seeking to enslave them (which may account, at least in part, for the efreet's disagreeable attitude). An efreeti operates under two limitations when using this ability. First, wishes can only be granted to creatures of the Prime Material Plane. Efreet cannot grant wishes to other genies (including jann), nor to any other creature from the inner or outer planes. Second, any wish that an efreeti grants will be reviewed by the efreeti' s own superiors in the City of Brass, and ultimately by the Sultan of the Efreet himself (see \"Habitat/Society\").</p><p class=\"f\"> Efreet can carry up to 750 pounds, afoot or flying, without tiring. They can carry twice that weight, or 1,500 pounds, for a limited time: three turns afoot or one turn aloft. For every 150 pounds below 1,500, the time limit increases by one tum. (For example, an efreeti can fly for three turns while carrying 1,200 pounds.) An efreeti who is fatigued by carrying a heavy load must rest for six full turns before engaging in strenuous activity again.</p><p class=\"f\"> <i>Interplanar Travel</i>: Like most genies, efreet can travel freely to any of the elemental planes, as well as to Prime Material Plane, Ethereal Plane, and Astral Plane. Due to strained relations with  other genie races, they normally remain on the Plane of Fire, though they occasionally establish trading operations on the Plane of Earth. Those upon the Prime Material Plane usually have been summoned by a sha'ir or a character who has a magical item.</p>\n<img src=\"/img/spc/genizkef1.gif\" width=\"300\" height=\"360\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Genie of Zakhara, Efreeti\" title=\"Genie of Zakhara, Efreeti\" style=\"float:left;\">\n<p class=\"f\"><b>Habitat/Society:</b> Efreet are famous for their hatred of servitude and their desire for justice and vengeance against those who have wronged them. They are also noted for their cruel natures and their ability to mislead and deceive. In part, this cruelty stems from the nature of the horrid masters who oversee them. But more than a few efreet relish their own brutality. The remainder merely shrug, and blame their evil society for their actions, not themselves.</p>\n<p class=\"f\"> The court of the efreet is the City of Brass, a great metropolis on the Elemental Plane of Fire. The city rises from a bowl-like hemisphere of glowing metal, measuring 40 miles across. The city is ruled by the efreet' s great sultan. His servants include a number of noble and common efreet who make the city their home.</p>\n<p class=\"f\"> While most efreet on the Plane of Fire reside in the City of Brass, there are military outposts scattered throughout the dimension. The stated purpose of these outposts is to protect the efreeti territories against incursions from the Elemental Planes of Air and Water. More often, they serve as bases for raids against other planes. The outposts also serve to regulate movement and travel in the efreeti territories. Four to 40 (4d10) efreet dwell at each post. They are governed by a malik or vali, who is a common efreeti of maximum hit points. In addition, there is a 10 percent chance that an outpost houses one to four (1d4) jann and one to four dao. There also may be 10 to 100 (lOdlO) prisoners or captives of the efreet, taken either from the Prime Material Plane or from raids against travelers in the Elemental Plane of Fire.</p>\n<p class=\"f\"> Given the oppressiveness of their native land, it is no surprise that efreet make extended visits to the Prime Material Plane. They prefer hot regions such as volcanoes, and open territory such as the Anvils of the great deserts. This love of the desert brings them into conflict with jann, whom the efreet can easily dominate, as well as djinn, with whom the efreet have maintained a low-level conflict for generations.</p>\n<p class=\"f\"> Due to their wish-granting ability, efreet have been exploited by mortals for eons, especially humans. As a result, efreet feel suspicion and spite for that race. The efreet capture or torment almost anyone they can, carrying suitable slaves back to the Plane of Fire for training at one of the outposts. Mortals who spoon out healthy portions of praise (and treasure) may find these genies more amenable, as may characters who seek to use an efreeti' s power to the detriment of other mortals. All efreet enjoy creating excitement, havok, and destruction, particularly if they cannot be held personally responsible. (\"Very sorry about your inn, most worthy mortal. I would have spared it if the sha'ir had permitted me to do so. But such was not the case, alas.\")</p>\n<p class=\"f\"> As noted above, any wish an efreeti grants will be reviewed by efreet superiors (perhaps even the eftreet's sultan). Superiors are both malevolent in nature and exacting in their bookkeeping. None looks favorably upon an efreeti who dispenses wishes like sweets to the benefit of others. An efreeti whose wish-granting is questioned must offer evidence of two circumstances: (1) the wish was granted against the efreeti' s will or better judgment (for example, the efreeti was imprisoned, threatened, ensorceled, or otherwise forced to act in a manner against its will); and (2) the efreeti proved its innate superiority by turning the wish against the user, thereby teaching the individual an important lesson (namely, don't ask anything of an efreeti). Efreet usually grant a malicious wish, but in a manner ensuring that the character who requests the baleful wish will be harmed along with the target of it.</p>\n<p class=\"f\"> Dealing with an efreeti is tricky. Sha'irs must choose their words carefully when confronting these genies. An efreeti makes an excellent advisor for those who seek nothing but malicious mischief and harm. Otherwise, only the strongest of masters should seek to harness the creature's abilities. Most genie prisons are used to trap the efreet and their equally detestable cousins, the dao.</p>\n<p class=\"f\"><b>Ecology:</b> As elemental creatures, efreet do not need to eat or drink in the traditional sense, and can go for years without a meal. They do enjoy the aroma of roasted meats and nuts, however. To efreet, \"cooked to perfection\" means \"burned almost to ash.\" In addition to charred food, efreet enjoy wines and kourniss that have been heated to the boiling point.</p>\n<p class=\"f\"> Efreet appreciate baubles, but they favor metals and gems that don't liquify in the heat of their native land. They treat their clothing with flame retardant oils, which prevent the fabric from bursting into flame upon contact with their elemental homeland. While such oils may be acquired and used by a mortal, they do not protect the wearer against fire damage-only the clothing that has been treated.</p>\n<p class=\"f\"> Efreet and djinn hate each other passionately. Efreeti invasions of the Elemental Plane of Air are common. The efreet tolerate dao (with whom they trade for raw gems) and dislike marids (whom they find haughty and overbearing). As for the jann, efreet seek to dominate them whenever and wherever they can. On the Plane of Fire, other fire elementals tend to avoid the efreet, since these genies view all other creatures, elemental or not, as enemies or potential slaves.</p>\n","images":["<img src=\"grf/xx.gif\" width=\"150\" height=\"75\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Advanced Dungeons & Dragons 2nd Edition\" title=\"Al-Qadim (Forgotten Realms)\" align=\"right\">","<img src=\"img/genizkef.gif\" alt=\"Genie of Zakhara, Efreeti\" title=\"Genie of Zakhara, Efreeti\" border=\"0\" width=\"300\" height=\"360\" style=\"text-align:right;\" align=\"right\">","<img src=\"/img/spc/genizkef1.gif\" width=\"300\" height=\"360\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Genie of Zakhara, Efreeti\" title=\"Genie of Zakhara, Efreeti\" style=\"float:left;\">","<img src=\"grf/tsr_sm.png\" width=\"56\" height=\"59\" border=\"0\" alt=\"TSR\">"],"setting":"Al-Qadim (Forgotten Realms)","statblock":{"Genie of Zakhara, Efreeti":{"Activity Cycle":"Day","Alignment":"Neutral","Armor Class":"2","Climate/Terrain":"Fire, desert","Damage/Attack":"3-24 (3d8)","Diet":"Omnivore","Frequency":"Very rare","Hit Dice":"10","Intelligence":"Very (11-12)","Magic Resistance":"Nil","Morale":"Champion (15-16)","Movement":"9, Fl 24 (B)","No. Appearing":"1","No. of Attacks":"1","Organization":"Sultanate","Size":"L (12 ft. tall)","Special Attacks":"See below","Special Defenses":"Fire resistance; see below","THAC0":"11","Treasure":"F","XP Value":"7,000"}},"title":"Genie of Zakhara, Efreeti"},"sources":["1077"],"statblock_names":[],"title":"Genie of Zakhara, Efreeti","prev_key":"genizkdj","next_key":"genizkjn","monster_path":"/appendix/genizkef"}},"staticQueryHashes":[],"slicesMap":{}}
