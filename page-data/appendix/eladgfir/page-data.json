The firres (pronounced <i>feers</i>) are creatures who live for beauty; their lives are consumed by a fiery passion for art of any kind, and they strive to make their own existence a living image of wonder and delight.</p><p>The firre eladrins live as wandering minstrels and bards in Arborea, attending the courts of more powerful eladrins or tarrying to entertain a circle of coures in a forgotten dell. Their pursuit of beauty leads them to any place where art, skill, or grace is held in high esteem. A body could run across a firre traveling the Outlands or visiting the palaces of neutral-aligned powers just as easily as he'd find one in Arborea. Firres have a deep love and appreciation of mortal art, and often embark on lengthy sojourns on the Prime Material Plane to seek out works of excellence.</p><p>In their natural form, firre eladrins resemble stocky <a href=\"/appendix/elf\">elves</a> with brilliant red hair and fiery red eyes. At first glance, a firre might be taken for a <a href=\"/appendix/elfhalf\">half-elf</a>, but her eyes give her away; they have no iris or pupil, and glow brightly with the firre's inner flame. Firres can also transform themselves into man-size pillars or balls of fire; in this form they can fly at the listed rate.</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Combat:</b> Like the <a href=\"/appendix/eladlbra\">bralani</a> or <a href=\"/appendix/eladlcou\">coures</a>, firres often use weapons in their demihuman form. They're far stronger than they look and possess an 18/00 Strength. Firres favor long, wavy-bladed swords equal to <i>two-handed swords +3</i>. They also may use slender javelins that become blazing bolts of fire when thrown, inflicting damage as a <i>javelin +5</i>. (The javelin's consumed in the throw, but many firre carry up to four.) A creature that meets the fiery glance of an angry firre must successfully save versus paralyzation or be blinded for 2d10 rounds, suffering 1d10 points of damage.</p><p>In her fiery form, a firre can strike twice per round for 3d6 points of damage per attack. Any creature within 10 feet of the burning firre must make a successful save versus spell or suffer 1d6 points of damage from the heat. Any weapon that strikes a fiery firre must survive an item saving throw versus magical fire or be destroyed, although the firre still takes damage from a successful hit.</p><p>In any shape, the firre eladrin radiates <i>protection from evil</i> in a 10-foot radius. The firre can also use the following spell-like powers once per round at will: <i>advanced illusion</i>, <i>affect normal fires</i>, <i>continual light</i>, <i>detect invisibility</i>, <i>ESP</i>, <i>improved invisibility</i>, <i>polymorph self</i>, <i>wall of fire</i>, or cast a 10d6 <i>fireball</i>. Once per day the firre can create a <i>prismatic spray</i>. In addition to these spell-like powers, the firre has the spell ability of a 9th-level priest.</p><p>In demihuman form, the firre can choose to sing instead of attack. Her unearthly voice functions as a <i>charm</i>, <i>hold</i>, <i>sleep</i>, or <i>suggestion</i> spell on any creature within 50 feet. (The firre chooses the exact effect.) Any listeners must successfully save versus spell or be affected, The firre's <i>sleep</i> song can affect creatures normally unaffected by <i>sleep</i> spells.</p><p>Firres can be hit only by weapons of +2 or greater enchantment, or cold-wrought iron weapons. They suffer normal - not doubled - damage from such weapons.</p><br clear=\"all\" style=\"clear:both; height:0;\">\r\n","images":["<img src=\"grf/ps.gif\" width=\"150\" height=\"75\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Planescape\" title=\"Planescape\" align=\"right\">","<img src=\"img/eladgfir.gif\" alt=\"Eladrin, Greater, Firre\" title=\"Eladrin, Greater, Firre\" border=\"0\" width=\"300\" height=\"360\" style=\"text-align:right;\" align=\"right\">","<img src=\"grf/add2_01.gif\" width=\"200\" height=\"56\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Advanced Dungeons & Dragons 2nd Edition\">"],"setting":"Planescape","statblock":{"Eladrin, Greater, Firre":{"Activity Cycle":"Any","Alignment":"Chaotic good","Armor Class":"-3","Climate/Terrain":"Arborea","Damage/Attack":"By weapon +6 or 3d6/3d6","Diet":"Omnivore","Frequency":"Rare","Hit Dice":"7+10","Intelligence":"Genius (17-18)","Magic Resistance":"40%","Morale":"Champion (15-16)","Movement":"15, F1 36 (A)","No. Appearing":"1-4","No. of Attacks":"1 or 2","Organization":"Solitary","Size":"M (6' tall)","Special Attacks":"Spellsong","Special Defenses":"Magic use, shapechange; struck only by cold iron or weapon of +2 or better enchantment","THAC0":"13","Treasure":"Incidental","XP Value":"14,000"}},"title":"Eladrin, Greater, Firre"},"sources":["2613"],"statblock_names":[],"title":"Eladrin, Greater, Firre","prev_key":"ekimmu","next_key":"eladggha"}},"staticQueryHashes":[],"slicesMap":{}}
