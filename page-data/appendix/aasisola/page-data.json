They appear as large humans who have beautiful muscular bodies, white wings, and brilliant topaz eyes. Their skin and hair take on metallic coloration. A solar's voice is deep and commanding, impossible to ignore, and their Charisma is 24.</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Combat:</b> Solars are never surprised and are immune to attacks from nonmagical weapons and magical weapons of +4 or lesser enchantment, to energy-level loss from undead or magic, and to <i>charm</i>, <i>confusion</i>, <i>death spell</i>, <i>domination</i>, <i>feeblemind</i>, <i>hold</i>, <i>imprisonment</i>, and <i>trap the soul</i> spells.</p><p>Each solar can cast a <i>protection from evil</i> spell wirh a 70-foot radius at will. This sphere also serves as <i>protection from normal missiles</i> and a <i>minor globe of invulnerability</i> if the solar desires. Solars can use any <i>detect</i> spell at will. When laying hands on a creature, a solar can bestow the ability to survive in any environment for up to 100 years.</p><p>Lawful-good solars can summon 1 to 2 <a href=\"/appendix/kirin\">ki-rins</a>; neutral good solars can summon 1 to 2 <a href=\"/appendix/phoenix\">phoenix</a>; and chaotic good solars can summon 1 to 2 greater <a href=\"/appendix/titan\">titans</a>. Solars can perform the summoning three times per day with a 75% chance of success per summons.</p><p>Solars are not affected by cold, electrical, magic missile, petrification, poison, or any gas attack. They take no damage from acid attacks. They regenerate 7 hit points per melee round. Unless it is on its home plane, only the material form of a solar can be destroyed. Its spirit requires seven decades to reform.</p><p>Each solar attacks four times per ropund wirh a sword that only it can wield. The weapon acts as a <i>sword +5</i> (2d20 points of damage) and has all the properties of a <i>sword of dancing</i> and a <i>vorpal sword</i>.</p><p>Solars also use an enormous composite bow with a magical quiver that produces any <i>arrow of slaying</i> the solar desires. Each bow attack has a +2 attack adjustment and slays any target it hits.</p><p>A solar has spells as a 15th-level priest with major access to all spheres. In addition to the powers common to aasimon, solars have the following spell-like powers: <i>animate object</i> (3 times per day), <i>antipathy/sympathy</i> (3 times per day), <i>astral spell</i> (once per day), <i>commune</i>, <i>confusion</i> (3 times per day), <i>control weather</i>, <i>creeping doom</i> (once per day), <i>dispel evil</i>, <i>dispel magic</i>, <i>Drawmij's instant summons</i>, <i>earthquake</i> (3 times per day), <i>finger of death</i> (once per day), <i>fire storm</i> (once per day), <i>heal</i>, <i>holy word</i> (3 times per day), <i>imprisonment</i> (once per day), <i>improved invisibility</i>, <i>infravision</i> (240 feet, always active), <i>mass charm</i> (3 times per day), <i>permanency</i> (3 times per day), <i>polymorph any object or self</i> (once per day), <i>power word</i> (any variety, once per day), <i>prismatic spray</i> (once per day), <i>restoration</i> (once per day), <i>resurrection</i> (3 times per day), <i>shape change</i> (3 times per day), <i>symbol</i> (any variety, 3 times per day), <i>vanish</i> (3 times per day), <i>vision</i> (once per day), <i>wind walk</i> (7 times per day), and <i>wish</i> (once per day).</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Habitat/Society:</b> Solars are absolutely the most powerful servants of the good deities of the Upper Planes.</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Ecology:</b> Solars are mighty enough to be deities themselves, but they choose to serve rather than have worshipers.</p><br clear=\"all\" style=\"clear:both; height:0;\">\r\n","images":["<img src=\"grf/ps.gif\" width=\"150\" height=\"75\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Planescape\" title=\"Planescape\" align=\"right\">","<img src=\"img/aasisola.gif\" alt=\"Aasimon, Solar\" title=\"Aasimon, Solar\" border=\"0\" width=\"300\" height=\"360\" style=\"text-align:right;\" align=\"right\">","<img src=\"grf/add2_01.gif\" width=\"200\" height=\"56\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Advanced Dungeons & Dragons 2nd Edition\">"],"setting":"Planescape","statblock":{"Aasimon, Solar":{"Activity Cycle":"Any","Alignment":"Any good","Armor Class":"-10","Climate/Terrain":"Upper Planes","Damage/Attack":"2d20+16","Diet":"Omnivore","Frequency":"Very rare","Hit Dice":"22 (177 hp)","Intelligence":"Supra-genius (19-20)","Magic Resistance":"85%","Morale":"Fearless (19-20)","Movement":"18, Fl 48 (B)","No. Appearing":"1","No. of Attacks":"4","Organization":"Solitary","Size":"L (9' tall)","Special Attacks":"Vorpal severing, arrows of slaying","Special Defenses":"See below","THAC0":"5 (+5 weapon bonus)","Treasure":"Nil","XP Value":"32,000"}},"title":"Aasimon, Solar"},"sources":["2118","2602"],"statblock_names":[],"title":"Aasimon, Solar","prev_key":"aasiplan","next_key":"aballin","monster_path":"/appendix/aasisola"}},"staticQueryHashes":[],"slicesMap":{}}
