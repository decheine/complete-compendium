While the powers listed above are the most common, some aarakocra have different or additional powers.</p><p class=\"f\">A race of intelligent, birdlike creatures living in the deepest deserts of Athas, the rare Athasian <a href=\"/appendix/aarakocr\">aarakocra</a> spends its time soaring on thermals in search of food.</p><p>The aarakocra is 7 to 8 feet tall with a wingspan of 20 feet or more. Because of its large wingspan, an aarakocra can carry as much as 75% of its own body weight and still fly easily. An aarakocra can fly a short distance carrying a burden equaling 125% of its own body weight. The average body weight of a full grown male is 100 pounds and a female is 85 pounds.</p><p>Each wing has a &ldquo;hand&rdquo; at its midpoint, consisting of three fingers and an opposable thumb. The fourth finger forms the rigid leading edge of the wing. In flight the hands cannot be used, but on the ground the aarakocra can use its hands almost as a human would. The aarakocra's body is protected by a thin bony plate on the chest, much like a solid rib cage. Talons on its legs can be used as claws and can be retracted to reveal a second set of hands, also with three fingers and an opposable thumb. Except for the chest plate, the entire skeleton is hollow and extremely fragile.</p><p>From a distance, the Athasian aarakocra resembles a huge <a href=\"/appendix/bird\">vulture</a>. Its black eyes, set in the front of the head, provide excellent vision over a long range. The plumage is generally black with a white collar for adult males and black or brown with a smaller white collar for females. Adolescents are a mixture of brown and black. The beak is large and covers most of the head. Plumage begins at the crown of the head and is darker near the head, except for the collar. Athasian aarakocra speak their own language and the languages of vultures and other large birds. Some speak the common tongue (5% to 10% chance depending on how deep in the wastelands a tribe lives).</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Combat:</b> Aarakocra can fight in the air or on the ground. They prefer aerial combat since their bones are too fragile to withstand a solid blow from a human-sized opponent. In combat against creatures on the ground, they prefer to fly over their victim and drop weighted nets. Some aarakocra use darts to harass ground-based opponents.</p><p>If their opponents can fly, the aarakocra generally forgo the use of the net, although large groups sometimes use nets on flying creatures. Normally, aarakocra attack flying creatures with long spears, diving from above and allowing the momentum to carry the spear through the target. Such an attack doubles the damage if the aarakocra have been able to dive at least 50 feet. Only the very largest aarakocra can carry more than one of these spears, they can attack with both at once with no penalty, causing double damage on each strike. All diving attacks are made at +4 and should be treated as a charge attack. All other penalties and restrictions of charge attacks apply.</p><p>The effect of the aarakocra's nets depends on if the opponent is flying at the time it becomes entangled. Creatures on the ground that are hit by a net are entangled and unable to participate in any combat until they make a successful Strength check to get free of the net. Flying creatures hit by a net can no longer fly and immediately begin falling. If they cannot escape the net or use some magical means to arrest the fall, normal falling damage applies.</p><p>Unless victims are entangled in nets, aarakocra are cautious in ground combat. If the aarakocra outnumber their opponents they advance in a straight line and thrust with their spears. If outnumbered, or the opponents are particularly tough, the aarakocra withdraw. Victims entangled in nets are killed or incapacitated for use as food or ransom.</p><p>Athasian aarakocra are mindful of their physical limitations as well as their comparatively low psionic abilities. They do not normally initiate psionic combat. At the first sign of psionic powers from any of their victims, however, all aarakocra that have some ability will use whatever attack and defense modes they can in an attempt to destroy the threat. Large groups of is or more aarakocra may initiate psionic combat if their leaders feel they can win quickly and avoid physical combat.</p><p>In desperation, an aarakocra can attempt to bite an opponent in combat. Because of the unwieldiness of its beak, the aarakocra has a THAC0 of 18 if attacking with this appendage. Further, the birdman causes only 1d2 points of damage with the beak.</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Habitat/Society:</b> Athasian aarakocra live in tribes with 6-20 (2d8+4) members, depending on the prestige of the leader. The largest tribe ever recorded had 50 members. The tribal hunting territory depends on the size of the tribe, usually about 500 square miles for a tribe of 10 members. There are no rigid boundaries between tribes and border disputes are not uncommon.</p><p>Alignments of tribe members are similar to the alignment of the leader. A tribe that has a leader who is neutral good may have neutral good, chaotic good, lawful good, and true neutral members. A predominantly evil tribe does not recognize boundaries with other tribes and treats other tribes as inferior beings to be eliminated.</p><p>Athasian aarakocra aren't happy in enclosed spaces, but they they take refuge in a cave or building if necessary.</p><p>Nonevil tribes live in rocky aeries in the highest peaks they can find. Evil tribes are normally nomadic and use an aerie made by another tribe if they need to remain in an area for a long time, even if they have to evict the tribe that made the nest.</p><p>Aarakocra aren't friendly toward intruders in their territory, especially caravans. They try to extract a toll from the caravan for passage through the desert. Good-aligned tribes allow unhindered passage of caravans that pay a tribute. If someone refuses to pay the tribute, the aarakocra try to capture scouts or outriders from the party and hold them until an even larger tribute is paid. The payment may be either livestock or shiny objects. Aarakocra are smart enough not to be taken in by glass baubles instead of gems, although they cannot tell the difference between the more common gems and the rare ones.</p><p>Evil tribes ask for tribute and often attack a caravan whether it pays or not. Aarakocra always demand shiny objects such as stones. These tribes find humans and demihumans to be quite tasty and prefer them to other food.</p><p>Good-aligned tribes of aarakocra sometimes return a lost traveler to the edge of the desert after first removing any valuables the traveler may be carrying. On very rare occasions a tribe might return a lost group of travelers to the more frequently traveled parts of the desert, again after first taking any valuables as payment.</p><p>The oldest male is the leader of the tribal hunting party and has 4+4 Hit Dice. The oldest female is in charge of the tribal aerie and has 3+3 HD. In tribes that have more than 15 members, the next oldest aarakocra serves as shaman and has 3+3 HD; the shaman completes the triumvirate necessary for proper worship and the summoning of elementals. (Interestingly, no magic-using aarakocra has ever been recorded.) Tribes without a shaman cannot summon <a href=\"/appendix/element1\">air elementals</a>, which is an important part of aarakocra culture.</p><p>The shaman is the leader of the daily sun worship. Aarakocra worship the sun because it provides them with the thermals they need to soar in search of food. The shaman also leads the mystic rituals used to summon an air elemental. Summoning an air elemental is usually done only in preparation for the tribe's most sacred ceremony, the hunt. Small tribes must band together for this ceremony to allow the triumvirate to be formed.</p><p>The ceremony to summon an air elemental must be conducted at dawn and requires the oldest male and female to emit a highpitched keening whistle. The shaman conducts an intricate dance around them, simultaneously chanting an ancient summoning mantra.</p><p>The hunt is the final part of the initiation of adolescent aarakocra to adulthood and often takes the tribe far from their normal teritory. The target is always a <a href=\"/appendix/drakalsi\">silt drake</a>. The hunt is the only time the females leave the relative safety of the nest. Even an evil tribe will not interfere with a tribe on a hunt. An air elemental is often summoned to help find the drake, but never takes part in the actual combat. Although the adult members of the tribe take part in the initial phases of the combat, it is the initiates who deliver the final, killing blows to me drake. Scars from the hunt are considered a mark of pride among all aarakocra.</p><p>The females spend about eight months of the year incubating their eggs. Athasian aarakocra mate for life and a pair normally produces as many as 10 offspring. A female lays one egg a year. Constant incubation is not required because of the high daytime temperatures, so the females can maintain the nest and keep the tribe's treasure in order.</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Ecology:</b> Athasian aarakocra are high on the food chain and have no natural enemies other than <a href=\"/appendix/drakatha\">drakes</a>. Unless evil, aarakocra leave their own territory only to hunt the silt drake and return as soon as possible when the hunt is over. (Evil aarakocra attack others, as noted above.) Aarakocra eggs and hatchlings are sought after by wealthy land owners who wish to use the creatures as scouts and sentries. An egg can bring as much as 10 cp in Tyr's marketplace. Tribes that have had eggs or hatchlings stolen have long memories and sometimes take revenge against the thief at a later date. Captive aarakocra join any tribe they come in contact with.</p><p>Athasian aarakocra have a natural life span of 21-30 years.</p><br clear=\"all\" style=\"clear:both; height:0;\">\r\n","images":["<img src=\"grf/ds.gif\" width=\"150\" height=\"75\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Dark Sun\" title=\"Dark Sun\" align=\"right\">","<img src=\"img/aarakath.gif\" alt=\"Aarakocra (Athas)\" title=\"Aarakocra (Athas)\" border=\"0\" width=\"300\" height=\"360\" style=\"text-align:right;\" align=\"right\">","<img src=\"grf/add2_01.gif\" width=\"200\" height=\"56\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Advanced Dungeons & Dragons 2nd Edition\">"],"setting":"Dark Sun","statblock":{"Aarakocra (Athas)":{"Activity Cycle":"Day","Alignment":"Any","Armor Class":"7","Climate/Terrain":"Deep desert","Damage/Attack":"1d3/1d3 or by weapon","Diet":"Carnivore","Frequency":"Rare","Hit Dice":"2+2","Intelligence":"Average (8-10)","Magic Resistance":"Nil","Morale":"Steady (11)","Movement":"6, Fl 36 (C)","No. Appearing":"1d10","No. of Attacks":"2","Organization":"Tribal","Size":"M (20'+ wingspan)","Special Attacks":"Nil","Special Defenses":"Nil","THAC0":"17","Treasure":"Varies","XP Value":"65"}},"title":"Aarakocra (Athas)"},"sources":["2433"],"statblock_names":[],"title":"Aarakocra (Athas)","prev_key":"zygraat","next_key":"aarakocr","monster_path":"/appendix/aarakath"}}},"pageContext":{"monster_key":"delphon","monster_data":{"TSR":["2615"],"fullBody":"  <table cellspacing=\"0\" cellpadding=\"0\"><tr><th>Climate/Terrain:</th><td>Oceanus</td></tr><tr><th>Frequency:</th><td>Rare</td></tr><tr><th>Organization:</th><td>Clan</td></tr><tr><th>Activity Cycle:</th><td>Any</td></tr><tr><th>Diet:</th><td>Carnivore</td></tr><tr><th>Intelligence:</th><td>High (13-14)</td></tr><tr><th>Treasure:</th><td>Nil</td></tr><tr><th>Alignment:</th><td>Neutral</td></tr><tr><th>No. Appearing:</th><td>1d8</td></tr><tr><th>Armor Class:</th><td>5</td></tr><tr><th>Movement:</th><td>Sw 15</td></tr><tr><th>Hit Dice:</th><td>5</td></tr><tr><th>THAC0:</th><td>15</td></tr><tr><th>No. of Attacks:</th><td>1 or 2</td></tr><tr><th>Damage/Attack:</th><td>1d8 or 1d6/1d10</td></tr><tr><th>Special Attacks:</th><td>Song</td></tr><tr><th>Special Defenses:</th><td><i>Plane shift</i></td></tr><tr><th>Magic Resistance:</th><td>Nil</td></tr><tr><th>Size:</th><td>L (8' long)</td></tr><tr><th>Morale:</th><td>Elite (13-14)</td></tr><tr><th>XP Value:</th><td>1,400</td></tr></table><p class=\"f\">Delphons, or songsharks, live in the River Oceanus, swimming through the planes of Elysium, the Beastlands, and Arborea. It is said that bashers seeking secrets relating to the nature of the planes and the multiverse in general should dive into the River Oceanus and swim through the thick melodies of these mysterious singing creatures.</p><p>Delphons resemble <a href=\"/appendix/shark\">sharks</a> with long, powerful fins, and sleek, silvery bodies. A few individuals have differing coloration, found in brilliant reds, deep blues, and vibrant greens. Delphons often carve complicated and beautiful tattoos into their flesh by rubbing against sharp rock formations along the side of the river. Like sharks, they have wide mouths filled with sharp teeth.</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Combat:</b> Although a delphon can use its mouth to bite (1d8) or its streamlined head and powerful tail (1d6/1d10) to bash and strike foes in melee, these attacks are not its most devastating. The song of a dolphin is so alien and mysterious to other creatures that it has profound effects on them. If an intelligent creature hears the keening voice of a delphon, a saving throw versus paralyzation is required to avoid the effects. If the saving throw is failed, roll 1d12 to determine what happens to the listener.</p><table class=\"ip\"><tr class=\"bk\"><th>D12 Roll</th><th>Effect</th></tr><tr><td>1-4</td><td>Listener is <i>charmed</i> for 1d10 hours, enamored by the sound of the sweet melodies.</td></tr><tr><td>5-7</td><td>Listener is affected by <i>confusion</i> for 3d6 rounds, unable to comprehend the alieness of the bizarre sounds</td></tr><tr><td>8-9</td><td>Listener is spellbound (<i>held</i>) by the sound for 1d10 rounds</td></tr><tr><td>10-11</td><td>Listener is rendered unconscious for 3d10 rounds, unable to handle the mind-shattering notes and their profound meanings</td></tr><tr><td>12</td><td>Listener is struck by the sound so completely that he begins to learn the the meaning of the song, and suddenly understands something new about the multiverse</td></tr></table><p>Those that make a successful saving throw hear nothing more than odd, discordant music. Creatures that avoid the negative effects of the song gain a bit of planar knowledge about travel on Oceanus, the relationships between the planes (especially those that Oceanus touches), or places on and around Oceanus. In game terms, characters that fail the saving throw but roll a 12 on the die may ask the DM one question pertaining to Oceanus and its environs. Some such questions include: the location of the nearest gate to a neighboring plane; how to reach the Isles of the Blessed in Thalasia; whether or not the River Oceanus is truly beginning to &ldquo;leak&rdquo; over into Ysgard through the Gates of the Moon; or how to avoid the natural hazards of travel on Oceanus.</p><p>Nonintelligent listeners are always charmed by the delphon's song. Eventually, intelligent beings that spend time around the dolphins grow immune to the strange consequences of their songs, learning to more fully understand their deep and complicated meanings.</p><p>The delphons know many of the secrets of the River Oceanus and its multiplanar and multidimensional nature. Because of this, as they swim through its waters they can dart in and out of the various planes that the river reaches, returning whenever they please, unfettered by what would seem to be normal laws of movement. This means that the delphons can effectively <i>plane shift</i> at will to any plane that Oceanus touches (Elysium, the Beastlands, and Arborea). In combat, a delphon has a 25% chance to simply avoid any incoming attack by passing through the extradimensional nature of Oceanus and reappearing somewhat else in its waters, returning to make an attack or take some other action the very next round.</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Habitat/Society:</b> Delphons are extremely gregarious creatures, usually found in clannish packs. These individuals are almost always related, supporting and aiding each other but also occasonally associating with other delphon clans. There seem to be no leaders or superiors amid their numbers, every individual holding the same rights and authority. Because each has an equal say, though, delphon debates are common, with songs of disagreement filling the air near Oceanus. Obviously, other beings should avoid such delphonic conclaves for fear of the songs' effects upon them.</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Ecology:</b> Delphons feed upon the other <a href=\"/appendix/fish\">fish</a> in Oceanus, often charming them with their song and then moving in for the kill. Fortunately, the river teems with life, and rarely are delphons so hungry that they need to attack drylanders who stay too near the river's edge, ply its water with boats, or enter its depths directly.</p><p>It is not unreasonable that an intelligent creature such as a human or an <a href=\"/appendix/elf\">elf</a> who has somehow mastered enough of the delphon's songs to understand and imitate the sounds (albeit crudely) could befriend the creatures and make allies of them. Such a partnership would be greatly beneficial to the land creature, for delphons are able to take other swimming creatures with them when they move through Oceanus (even from plane to plane).</p><p>On the Beastlands there is an old (perhaps crazed) <a href=\"/appendix/githzera\">githzerai</a> hermit who claims to have mastered all of the delphons' songs. The Singing <a href=\"/appendix/gith\">Gith</a>, as he is known, tells thusly the tale of his first meeting with the delphons:</p><p>&ldquo;'Twas on the river's [Oceanus] edge on Arborea. Bunch o' dwarves with no business a-bein' there jumped me to get at me jink. I holds no love for givin' me gold to thieves back then, you see, so I give 'em a fight. Well, they's small but tough, and they gives me a thrashin'. They take me jink and throws me in the drink (hee hee).</p><p>&ldquo;In them days, I was no swimmer. Now I swims just grand, but then, not so much. I was a-headed for the deadbook, no doubtin'. Then one o' the songsharks comes a-singin' his song. The music fills me ears faster'n the water is a-fillin' me lungs, and I finds m'self lovin' the melodies and understanding the meanin'. Twas talkin' about the harmony o' the planes and the connection of all things - includin' me and it.</p><p>&ldquo;Then, sure as you're a-standin' there - sure as Sigil - it lifts me with its powerful head an' pushes me up to the surface. I had heard the tales o' berks going barmy at hearing the delphon's song, but me, I was lovin' every note and understandin' it all. Now they's me friends, and no truer friends has a blood had. I learned to sing their song with 'em and to 'em and they understands me as good as I understands them. They tells me the dark of everythin' and so I know more than anyone 'bout just 'bout everything, see? Hey, berk, come back here, I be a-talkin' to you&hellip;&rdquo;</p><p>Few believe all the stories of the Singing Gith.</p><br clear=\"all\" style=\"clear:both; height:0;\">\r\n","images":["<img src=\"grf/ps.gif\" width=\"150\" height=\"75\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Planescape\" title=\"Planescape\" align=\"right\">","<img src=\"img/delphon.gif\" alt=\"Delphon\" title=\"Delphon\" border=\"0\" width=\"300\" height=\"360\" style=\"text-align:right;\" align=\"right\">","<img src=\"grf/add2_01.gif\" width=\"200\" height=\"56\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Advanced Dungeons & Dragons 2nd Edition\">"],"setting":"Planescape","statblock":{"Delphon":{"Activity Cycle":"Any","Alignment":"Neutral","Armor Class":"5","Climate/Terrain":"Oceanus","Damage/Attack":"1d8 or 1d6/1d10","Diet":"Carnivore","Frequency":"Rare","Hit Dice":"5","Intelligence":"High (13-14)","Magic Resistance":"Nil","Morale":"Elite (13-14)","Movement":"Sw 15","No. Appearing":"1d8","No. of Attacks":"1 or 2","Organization":"Clan","Size":"L (8' long)","Special Attacks":"Song","Special Defenses":"<i>Plane shift</i>","THAC0":"15","Treasure":"Nil","XP Value":"1,400"}},"title":"Delphon"},"sources":["2615"],"statblock_names":[],"title":"Delphon","prev_key":"delphini","next_key":"demarax","monster_path":"/appendix/delphon"}},"staticQueryHashes":[],"slicesMap":{}}
