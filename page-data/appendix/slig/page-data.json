While the powers listed above are the most common, some aarakocra have different or additional powers.</p><p class=\"f\">A race of intelligent, birdlike creatures living in the deepest deserts of Athas, the rare Athasian <a href=\"/appendix/aarakocr\">aarakocra</a> spends its time soaring on thermals in search of food.</p><p>The aarakocra is 7 to 8 feet tall with a wingspan of 20 feet or more. Because of its large wingspan, an aarakocra can carry as much as 75% of its own body weight and still fly easily. An aarakocra can fly a short distance carrying a burden equaling 125% of its own body weight. The average body weight of a full grown male is 100 pounds and a female is 85 pounds.</p><p>Each wing has a &ldquo;hand&rdquo; at its midpoint, consisting of three fingers and an opposable thumb. The fourth finger forms the rigid leading edge of the wing. In flight the hands cannot be used, but on the ground the aarakocra can use its hands almost as a human would. The aarakocra's body is protected by a thin bony plate on the chest, much like a solid rib cage. Talons on its legs can be used as claws and can be retracted to reveal a second set of hands, also with three fingers and an opposable thumb. Except for the chest plate, the entire skeleton is hollow and extremely fragile.</p><p>From a distance, the Athasian aarakocra resembles a huge <a href=\"/appendix/bird\">vulture</a>. Its black eyes, set in the front of the head, provide excellent vision over a long range. The plumage is generally black with a white collar for adult males and black or brown with a smaller white collar for females. Adolescents are a mixture of brown and black. The beak is large and covers most of the head. Plumage begins at the crown of the head and is darker near the head, except for the collar. Athasian aarakocra speak their own language and the languages of vultures and other large birds. Some speak the common tongue (5% to 10% chance depending on how deep in the wastelands a tribe lives).</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Combat:</b> Aarakocra can fight in the air or on the ground. They prefer aerial combat since their bones are too fragile to withstand a solid blow from a human-sized opponent. In combat against creatures on the ground, they prefer to fly over their victim and drop weighted nets. Some aarakocra use darts to harass ground-based opponents.</p><p>If their opponents can fly, the aarakocra generally forgo the use of the net, although large groups sometimes use nets on flying creatures. Normally, aarakocra attack flying creatures with long spears, diving from above and allowing the momentum to carry the spear through the target. Such an attack doubles the damage if the aarakocra have been able to dive at least 50 feet. Only the very largest aarakocra can carry more than one of these spears, they can attack with both at once with no penalty, causing double damage on each strike. All diving attacks are made at +4 and should be treated as a charge attack. All other penalties and restrictions of charge attacks apply.</p><p>The effect of the aarakocra's nets depends on if the opponent is flying at the time it becomes entangled. Creatures on the ground that are hit by a net are entangled and unable to participate in any combat until they make a successful Strength check to get free of the net. Flying creatures hit by a net can no longer fly and immediately begin falling. If they cannot escape the net or use some magical means to arrest the fall, normal falling damage applies.</p><p>Unless victims are entangled in nets, aarakocra are cautious in ground combat. If the aarakocra outnumber their opponents they advance in a straight line and thrust with their spears. If outnumbered, or the opponents are particularly tough, the aarakocra withdraw. Victims entangled in nets are killed or incapacitated for use as food or ransom.</p><p>Athasian aarakocra are mindful of their physical limitations as well as their comparatively low psionic abilities. They do not normally initiate psionic combat. At the first sign of psionic powers from any of their victims, however, all aarakocra that have some ability will use whatever attack and defense modes they can in an attempt to destroy the threat. Large groups of is or more aarakocra may initiate psionic combat if their leaders feel they can win quickly and avoid physical combat.</p><p>In desperation, an aarakocra can attempt to bite an opponent in combat. Because of the unwieldiness of its beak, the aarakocra has a THAC0 of 18 if attacking with this appendage. Further, the birdman causes only 1d2 points of damage with the beak.</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Habitat/Society:</b> Athasian aarakocra live in tribes with 6-20 (2d8+4) members, depending on the prestige of the leader. The largest tribe ever recorded had 50 members. The tribal hunting territory depends on the size of the tribe, usually about 500 square miles for a tribe of 10 members. There are no rigid boundaries between tribes and border disputes are not uncommon.</p><p>Alignments of tribe members are similar to the alignment of the leader. A tribe that has a leader who is neutral good may have neutral good, chaotic good, lawful good, and true neutral members. A predominantly evil tribe does not recognize boundaries with other tribes and treats other tribes as inferior beings to be eliminated.</p><p>Athasian aarakocra aren't happy in enclosed spaces, but they they take refuge in a cave or building if necessary.</p><p>Nonevil tribes live in rocky aeries in the highest peaks they can find. Evil tribes are normally nomadic and use an aerie made by another tribe if they need to remain in an area for a long time, even if they have to evict the tribe that made the nest.</p><p>Aarakocra aren't friendly toward intruders in their territory, especially caravans. They try to extract a toll from the caravan for passage through the desert. Good-aligned tribes allow unhindered passage of caravans that pay a tribute. If someone refuses to pay the tribute, the aarakocra try to capture scouts or outriders from the party and hold them until an even larger tribute is paid. The payment may be either livestock or shiny objects. Aarakocra are smart enough not to be taken in by glass baubles instead of gems, although they cannot tell the difference between the more common gems and the rare ones.</p><p>Evil tribes ask for tribute and often attack a caravan whether it pays or not. Aarakocra always demand shiny objects such as stones. These tribes find humans and demihumans to be quite tasty and prefer them to other food.</p><p>Good-aligned tribes of aarakocra sometimes return a lost traveler to the edge of the desert after first removing any valuables the traveler may be carrying. On very rare occasions a tribe might return a lost group of travelers to the more frequently traveled parts of the desert, again after first taking any valuables as payment.</p><p>The oldest male is the leader of the tribal hunting party and has 4+4 Hit Dice. The oldest female is in charge of the tribal aerie and has 3+3 HD. In tribes that have more than 15 members, the next oldest aarakocra serves as shaman and has 3+3 HD; the shaman completes the triumvirate necessary for proper worship and the summoning of elementals. (Interestingly, no magic-using aarakocra has ever been recorded.) Tribes without a shaman cannot summon <a href=\"/appendix/element1\">air elementals</a>, which is an important part of aarakocra culture.</p><p>The shaman is the leader of the daily sun worship. Aarakocra worship the sun because it provides them with the thermals they need to soar in search of food. The shaman also leads the mystic rituals used to summon an air elemental. Summoning an air elemental is usually done only in preparation for the tribe's most sacred ceremony, the hunt. Small tribes must band together for this ceremony to allow the triumvirate to be formed.</p><p>The ceremony to summon an air elemental must be conducted at dawn and requires the oldest male and female to emit a highpitched keening whistle. The shaman conducts an intricate dance around them, simultaneously chanting an ancient summoning mantra.</p><p>The hunt is the final part of the initiation of adolescent aarakocra to adulthood and often takes the tribe far from their normal teritory. The target is always a <a href=\"/appendix/drakalsi\">silt drake</a>. The hunt is the only time the females leave the relative safety of the nest. Even an evil tribe will not interfere with a tribe on a hunt. An air elemental is often summoned to help find the drake, but never takes part in the actual combat. Although the adult members of the tribe take part in the initial phases of the combat, it is the initiates who deliver the final, killing blows to me drake. Scars from the hunt are considered a mark of pride among all aarakocra.</p><p>The females spend about eight months of the year incubating their eggs. Athasian aarakocra mate for life and a pair normally produces as many as 10 offspring. A female lays one egg a year. Constant incubation is not required because of the high daytime temperatures, so the females can maintain the nest and keep the tribe's treasure in order.</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Ecology:</b> Athasian aarakocra are high on the food chain and have no natural enemies other than <a href=\"/appendix/drakatha\">drakes</a>. Unless evil, aarakocra leave their own territory only to hunt the silt drake and return as soon as possible when the hunt is over. (Evil aarakocra attack others, as noted above.) Aarakocra eggs and hatchlings are sought after by wealthy land owners who wish to use the creatures as scouts and sentries. An egg can bring as much as 10 cp in Tyr's marketplace. Tribes that have had eggs or hatchlings stolen have long memories and sometimes take revenge against the thief at a later date. Captive aarakocra join any tribe they come in contact with.</p><p>Athasian aarakocra have a natural life span of 21-30 years.</p><p></p><br clear=\"all\" style=\"clear:both; height:0;\">\r\n","images":["<img src=\"grf/ds.gif\" width=\"150\" height=\"75\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Dark Sun\" title=\"Dark Sun\" align=\"right\">","<img src=\"img/aarakath.gif\" alt=\"Aarakocra (Athas)\" title=\"Aarakocra (Athas)\" border=\"0\" width=\"300\" height=\"360\" style=\"text-align:right;\" align=\"right\">","<img src=\"grf/add2_01.gif\" width=\"200\" height=\"56\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Advanced Dungeons & Dragons 2nd Edition\">"],"setting":"Dark Sun","statblock":{"Aarakocra (Athas)":{"Activity Cycle":"Day","Alignment":"Any","Armor Class":"7","Climate/Terrain":"Deep desert","Damage/Attack":"1d3/1d3 or by weapon","Diet":"Carnivore","Frequency":"Rare","Hit Dice":"2+2","Intelligence":"Average (8-10)","Magic Resistance":"Nil","Morale":"Steady (11)","Movement":"6, Fl 36 (C)","No. Appearing":"1d10","No. of Attacks":"2","Organization":"Tribal","Size":"M (20'+ wingspan)","Special Attacks":"Nil","Special Defenses":"Nil","THAC0":"17","Treasure":"Varies","XP Value":"65"}},"title":"Aarakocra (Athas)"},"sources":["2433"],"statblock_names":[],"title":"Aarakocra (Athas)","prev_key":"zygraat","next_key":"aarakocr","monster_path":"/appendix/aarakath"}}},"pageContext":{"monster_key":"slig","monster_data":{"TSR":["2433"],"fullBody":"  <table cellspacing=\"0\" cellpadding=\"0\"><tr><th>Climate/Terrain:</th><td>Any land</td></tr><tr><th>Frequency:</th><td>Uncommon</td></tr><tr><th>Organization:</th><td>War band</td></tr><tr><th>Activity Cycle:</th><td>Any</td></tr><tr><th>Diet:</th><td>Carnivore</td></tr><tr><th>Intelligence:</th><td>Average (8-10)</td></tr><tr><th>Treasure:</th><td>Varies</td></tr><tr><th>Alignment:</th><td>Any neutral</td></tr><tr><th>No. Appearing:</th><td>5-30</td></tr><tr><th>Armor Class:</th><td>6</td></tr><tr><th>Movement:</th><td>12</td></tr><tr><th>Hit Dice:</th><td>4+1</td></tr><tr><th>THAC0:</th><td>17</td></tr><tr><th>No. of Attacks:</th><td>1</td></tr><tr><th>Damage/Attack:</th><td>1d8+1 (weapon) or 1d3 (bite)</td></tr><tr><th>Special Attacks:</th><td>Formation attack</td></tr><tr><th>Special Defenses:</th><td>Nil</td></tr><tr><th>Magic Resistance:</th><td>Nil</td></tr><tr><th>Size:</th><td>L (7' tall)</td></tr><tr><th>Morale:</th><td>Elite (15-16)</td></tr><tr><th>XP Value:</th><td>420</td></tr></table><p class=\"f\">Sligs are wide-jawed humanoids of the desert wilderness. Male sligs are tall and muscular, standing seven feet tall and weighing more than 300 pounds. Their skin color varies from a sickly white to tan and deep brown. Long red or auburn hair grows on their heads, forearms, and thighs, and sometimes on the back and rump as well. This hair is sometimes braided but more often left long. They have no ability to store fat in their bodies, so are especially lean in appearance.</p><p>Sligs seldom stand to their full height, instead adopting a hunched posture that allows their arms to assist in locomotion. Their arms and legs are extremely powerful. Their hands have a thumb and three very long fingers, each tipped with blunt black claws. Their heads are tapered at the top giving way to an extremely wide, but not protruding jaw. Their teeth are nasty, broken, and yellow, and are always displayed in a maniacal grin. Their eyes vary in color from black to silver beneath thick, almost reptile like ridges. Female sligs are similar in appearance, but much smaller, standing about 5 feet tall. Their hair is always braided, and their skin color is very light, usually white or tan. All sligs wear clothing made from animal skins and leather and carry their possessions in pouches. Different clothing denotes rank within the war band.</p><p>Sligs have a spoken language, but the number of concepts and words is limited to the essential concepts of their simple existence. Humans can learn slig speech, though no slig has ever done the reverse. There is no written version of the slig language. To facilitate the hunt and kill, male sligs have a telepathic communication. The telepathy is instinctive, restricted to necessary communication about the hunt and formation attacks and it cannot be used to send or receive any other messages.</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Combat:</b> Sligs are individually impressive, but not invincible. What makes them particularly formidable is their ability to attack in concert with one another, seeking out new and interesting ways to corner and kill their prey. Those appearing in any encounter are a war band of males. Females and young are found only in the lair. Females flee with their young when discovered and never fight.</p><p>Sligs fiaht with bone swords or wooden spears tipped with bone or chitin points. Either weapon inflicts 1-8 (1d8) points of damage plus 1 point because of the great strength of the attacking slig. When they have no weapons, sligs can also attack with their bite. The wide row of front teeth inflict 1-3 points of damage.</p><p>Sligs also have an instinctive ability to fight in small formations, using special talents to make the group more effective than the individuals. A slig formation consists of five sligs - two armed with swords, three armed with spears. The sword-armed sligs stand close in the front rank, while the spear-bearing sligs take up the back. The two outer spearbearers can attack to either side of the front rank sligs, while the center one attacks between them. The slig telepathy allows them to move without breaking the formation and lets them wield their weapons in such a rhythm that they never interfere with one another. All five sligs in a formation can attack any creature that either of the front rank sword-armed sligs can attack. If any of the sligs fall in combat, others can fill in the gaps. These sligs can attack without penalty in the round they join the formation. Sligs can also combine formations to attack a single target or use multiple formations or individual warriors to protect the flanks of those in combat.</p><p>Sligs also employ a number of unique tactics to best defeat their prey, especially prey that is ultimately stronger than they are. This is not a complete list of Slig tactics. Sligs pride themselves in devising new tactics, and such are the exclusive conversations around slig campfires.</p><p><i>Baiting:</i> Sligs are clever enough to know what adventurers want - teasure, metal, and even the mundane such as water or food. They have been known to move ahead of traveling adventurers to set up obvious caches of such items just to catch them off their guard. These caches are most often set into ditches or ravines so the slig can surround from above, gaining the obvious height advantage. The cache can be as simple as a half-buried barrel or crate or as elaborate as the mock wreckage of an ambushed caravan, complete with slain animals and smoldering wagons.</p><p><i>Kidnapping/Theft:</i> Sligs also know of something more tempting than an item never possessed, and that is something a traveler has lost. Sligs set up complicated schemes to sneak into camps to snatch valuables or even unwitting prisoners, then beat a hasty retreat, leaving an easy-to-follow trail. Again, they lead the pursuers to a remote point where they can take advantage of the terrain in combat, such as to rocky badlands or deep wadis. There is little hope for prisoners taken by sligs unless the pursuers can catch up to them in time.</p><p><i>Track Ambush:</i> When no travelers readily present themselves, sligs entrench along a common track and wait. Sligs dig their own separate holes, barely large enough to get into with their weapons, then their fellows cover it with a hide stretched over a frame. The hide is camouflaged with sand, rocks, and scrub and the sligs wait patiently for passersby. The ambushers use their telepathy to launch the assault silently, yet simultaneously. The sligs between Urik and Raam were so successful that the merchant houses there, Stel and M'ke, put a bounty on them to clear them from the area. Many coins later, sligs are as plentiful as ever across the Great Alluvial Sand Wastes.</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Habitat/Society:</b> The war band is leaderless. There is no hierarchy among the warriors. The natural telepathy gives the sligs more cohesion and &ldquo;leadership&rdquo; than any chieftain could provide. Tactics are instantly conceived and executed by the collective group of warriors. Slig warriors within the band keep track of major kills using ritual scarring along the forearms and calves, but individual success merely dictates mating rights, not leadership, during the hunt.</p><p>Unlike most creatures of the sand wastes, sligs are actually sedentary monsters, preparing permanent homes from which they deploy their war bands. They are very adaptable to their terrain, taking advantage of the best of the local features to create a permanent, safe living environment. Sligs in the rocky badlands, for instance, pile stones and slabs beneath natural outcroppings to form the basis of their dwellings. Their architecture is crude and they have no bonding materials such as cement, but such lairs are sturdy and present formidable defenses. Sligs nearer to the mountains most often seek out caves that they widen and expand for their own uses. Slig miners seek out metal digging tools among their victims.</p><p>The slig family unit is everchanging. Slig females take mates three times per year and each time with a different male based on his most recent performance on the hunt. This way, consistently good hunters get the opportunity to father more children than less successful ones. Slig communities are not given to cooperating with one another, and it is extremely rare that a slig from one community can gain acceptance into another.</p><p>When not hunting, slig males are also crude craftsmen. They use available materials to fashion their weapons, the spears and swords of the attack formations, hewing them from stone or bone depending on what is available. Sligs use every bit of their kills, including the hides. From them they create leather harnesses and pouches, shelters, and blankets. By human or <a href=\"/appendix/dwaratha\">dwarven</a> standards, slig craftsmanship is primitive, but it provides them with the tools they need to survive. They supplement their own tools with those they take from their victims. Sligs never leave anything valuable at the site of the kill unless they are forced to retreat. A slig warrior likely has some item taken from another, more technological race.</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Ecology:</b> Ecology: Slig females mate three times per year. Gestation takes three months, after which she gives birth to a single child. Twins and triplets are also possible, with roughly the frequency common to human births. The young mature quickly, growing to self sufficiency within the community in just six months and then to full maturity in just one year. To achieve this growth slig children eat ravenously of the kills brought back by the hunters. The saying &ldquo;sligging down&rdquo; one's meal comes from the few who have witnessed the inside of a slig community and lived to tell about it.</p><p>Sligs cannot naturally store fat within their own bodies, so they must feed constantly. The hunt follows a thrice daily cycle - the dawn hunt, the midday hunt, and the midnight hunt. Kills are taken immediately to the community where females and children are allowed to dine first, followed by the hunters. A slig that doesn't get nourishment for three days will die of starvation. But sligs have a natural ability to recycle their bodily fluids, so need surprisingly little water considering their environment and activity level.</p><p>Alchemists have noted the pseudopsionic nature of the slig telepathy and seek specimens with which to experiment. It is believed that slig blood or marrow is actually a stimulant to psionic activity, but these are just old wives' tales. Serious attempts by alchemists to prove them right, however, have made sligs quite valuable. Some in Raam and Balic have offered as much as 20 cp for a live slig.</p><p></p><br clear=\"all\" style=\"clear:both; height:0;\">\r\n","images":["<img src=\"grf/ds.gif\" width=\"150\" height=\"75\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Dark Sun\" title=\"Dark Sun\" align=\"right\">","<img src=\"img/slig.gif\" alt=\"Slig\" title=\"Slig\" border=\"0\" width=\"300\" height=\"360\" style=\"text-align:right;\" align=\"right\">","<img src=\"grf/add2_01.gif\" width=\"200\" height=\"56\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Advanced Dungeons & Dragons 2nd Edition\">"],"setting":"Dark Sun","statblock":{"Slig":{"Activity Cycle":"Any","Alignment":"Any neutral","Armor Class":"6","Climate/Terrain":"Any land","Damage/Attack":"1d8+1 (weapon) or 1d3 (bite)","Diet":"Carnivore","Frequency":"Uncommon","Hit Dice":"4+1","Intelligence":"Average (8-10)","Magic Resistance":"Nil","Morale":"Elite (15-16)","Movement":"12","No. Appearing":"5-30","No. of Attacks":"1","Organization":"War band","Size":"L (7' tall)","Special Attacks":"Formation attack","Special Defenses":"Nil","THAC0":"17","Treasure":"Varies","XP Value":"420"}},"title":"Slig"},"sources":["2433"],"statblock_names":[],"title":"Slig","prev_key":"sleek","next_key":"slinker","monster_path":"/appendix/slig"}},"staticQueryHashes":[],"slicesMap":{}}
