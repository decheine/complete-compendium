While the powers listed above are the most common, some aarakocra have different or additional powers.</p><p class=\"f\">A race of intelligent, birdlike creatures living in the deepest deserts of Athas, the rare Athasian <a href=\"/appendix/aarakocr\">aarakocra</a> spends its time soaring on thermals in search of food.</p><p>The aarakocra is 7 to 8 feet tall with a wingspan of 20 feet or more. Because of its large wingspan, an aarakocra can carry as much as 75% of its own body weight and still fly easily. An aarakocra can fly a short distance carrying a burden equaling 125% of its own body weight. The average body weight of a full grown male is 100 pounds and a female is 85 pounds.</p><p>Each wing has a &ldquo;hand&rdquo; at its midpoint, consisting of three fingers and an opposable thumb. The fourth finger forms the rigid leading edge of the wing. In flight the hands cannot be used, but on the ground the aarakocra can use its hands almost as a human would. The aarakocra's body is protected by a thin bony plate on the chest, much like a solid rib cage. Talons on its legs can be used as claws and can be retracted to reveal a second set of hands, also with three fingers and an opposable thumb. Except for the chest plate, the entire skeleton is hollow and extremely fragile.</p><p>From a distance, the Athasian aarakocra resembles a huge <a href=\"/appendix/bird\">vulture</a>. Its black eyes, set in the front of the head, provide excellent vision over a long range. The plumage is generally black with a white collar for adult males and black or brown with a smaller white collar for females. Adolescents are a mixture of brown and black. The beak is large and covers most of the head. Plumage begins at the crown of the head and is darker near the head, except for the collar. Athasian aarakocra speak their own language and the languages of vultures and other large birds. Some speak the common tongue (5% to 10% chance depending on how deep in the wastelands a tribe lives).</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Combat:</b> Aarakocra can fight in the air or on the ground. They prefer aerial combat since their bones are too fragile to withstand a solid blow from a human-sized opponent. In combat against creatures on the ground, they prefer to fly over their victim and drop weighted nets. Some aarakocra use darts to harass ground-based opponents.</p><p>If their opponents can fly, the aarakocra generally forgo the use of the net, although large groups sometimes use nets on flying creatures. Normally, aarakocra attack flying creatures with long spears, diving from above and allowing the momentum to carry the spear through the target. Such an attack doubles the damage if the aarakocra have been able to dive at least 50 feet. Only the very largest aarakocra can carry more than one of these spears, they can attack with both at once with no penalty, causing double damage on each strike. All diving attacks are made at +4 and should be treated as a charge attack. All other penalties and restrictions of charge attacks apply.</p><p>The effect of the aarakocra's nets depends on if the opponent is flying at the time it becomes entangled. Creatures on the ground that are hit by a net are entangled and unable to participate in any combat until they make a successful Strength check to get free of the net. Flying creatures hit by a net can no longer fly and immediately begin falling. If they cannot escape the net or use some magical means to arrest the fall, normal falling damage applies.</p><p>Unless victims are entangled in nets, aarakocra are cautious in ground combat. If the aarakocra outnumber their opponents they advance in a straight line and thrust with their spears. If outnumbered, or the opponents are particularly tough, the aarakocra withdraw. Victims entangled in nets are killed or incapacitated for use as food or ransom.</p><p>Athasian aarakocra are mindful of their physical limitations as well as their comparatively low psionic abilities. They do not normally initiate psionic combat. At the first sign of psionic powers from any of their victims, however, all aarakocra that have some ability will use whatever attack and defense modes they can in an attempt to destroy the threat. Large groups of is or more aarakocra may initiate psionic combat if their leaders feel they can win quickly and avoid physical combat.</p><p>In desperation, an aarakocra can attempt to bite an opponent in combat. Because of the unwieldiness of its beak, the aarakocra has a THAC0 of 18 if attacking with this appendage. Further, the birdman causes only 1d2 points of damage with the beak.</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Habitat/Society:</b> Athasian aarakocra live in tribes with 6-20 (2d8+4) members, depending on the prestige of the leader. The largest tribe ever recorded had 50 members. The tribal hunting territory depends on the size of the tribe, usually about 500 square miles for a tribe of 10 members. There are no rigid boundaries between tribes and border disputes are not uncommon.</p><p>Alignments of tribe members are similar to the alignment of the leader. A tribe that has a leader who is neutral good may have neutral good, chaotic good, lawful good, and true neutral members. A predominantly evil tribe does not recognize boundaries with other tribes and treats other tribes as inferior beings to be eliminated.</p><p>Athasian aarakocra aren't happy in enclosed spaces, but they they take refuge in a cave or building if necessary.</p><p>Nonevil tribes live in rocky aeries in the highest peaks they can find. Evil tribes are normally nomadic and use an aerie made by another tribe if they need to remain in an area for a long time, even if they have to evict the tribe that made the nest.</p><p>Aarakocra aren't friendly toward intruders in their territory, especially caravans. They try to extract a toll from the caravan for passage through the desert. Good-aligned tribes allow unhindered passage of caravans that pay a tribute. If someone refuses to pay the tribute, the aarakocra try to capture scouts or outriders from the party and hold them until an even larger tribute is paid. The payment may be either livestock or shiny objects. Aarakocra are smart enough not to be taken in by glass baubles instead of gems, although they cannot tell the difference between the more common gems and the rare ones.</p><p>Evil tribes ask for tribute and often attack a caravan whether it pays or not. Aarakocra always demand shiny objects such as stones. These tribes find humans and demihumans to be quite tasty and prefer them to other food.</p><p>Good-aligned tribes of aarakocra sometimes return a lost traveler to the edge of the desert after first removing any valuables the traveler may be carrying. On very rare occasions a tribe might return a lost group of travelers to the more frequently traveled parts of the desert, again after first taking any valuables as payment.</p><p>The oldest male is the leader of the tribal hunting party and has 4+4 Hit Dice. The oldest female is in charge of the tribal aerie and has 3+3 HD. In tribes that have more than 15 members, the next oldest aarakocra serves as shaman and has 3+3 HD; the shaman completes the triumvirate necessary for proper worship and the summoning of elementals. (Interestingly, no magic-using aarakocra has ever been recorded.) Tribes without a shaman cannot summon <a href=\"/appendix/element1\">air elementals</a>, which is an important part of aarakocra culture.</p><p>The shaman is the leader of the daily sun worship. Aarakocra worship the sun because it provides them with the thermals they need to soar in search of food. The shaman also leads the mystic rituals used to summon an air elemental. Summoning an air elemental is usually done only in preparation for the tribe's most sacred ceremony, the hunt. Small tribes must band together for this ceremony to allow the triumvirate to be formed.</p><p>The ceremony to summon an air elemental must be conducted at dawn and requires the oldest male and female to emit a highpitched keening whistle. The shaman conducts an intricate dance around them, simultaneously chanting an ancient summoning mantra.</p><p>The hunt is the final part of the initiation of adolescent aarakocra to adulthood and often takes the tribe far from their normal teritory. The target is always a <a href=\"/appendix/drakalsi\">silt drake</a>. The hunt is the only time the females leave the relative safety of the nest. Even an evil tribe will not interfere with a tribe on a hunt. An air elemental is often summoned to help find the drake, but never takes part in the actual combat. Although the adult members of the tribe take part in the initial phases of the combat, it is the initiates who deliver the final, killing blows to me drake. Scars from the hunt are considered a mark of pride among all aarakocra.</p><p>The females spend about eight months of the year incubating their eggs. Athasian aarakocra mate for life and a pair normally produces as many as 10 offspring. A female lays one egg a year. Constant incubation is not required because of the high daytime temperatures, so the females can maintain the nest and keep the tribe's treasure in order.</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Ecology:</b> Athasian aarakocra are high on the food chain and have no natural enemies other than <a href=\"/appendix/drakatha\">drakes</a>. Unless evil, aarakocra leave their own territory only to hunt the silt drake and return as soon as possible when the hunt is over. (Evil aarakocra attack others, as noted above.) Aarakocra eggs and hatchlings are sought after by wealthy land owners who wish to use the creatures as scouts and sentries. An egg can bring as much as 10 cp in Tyr's marketplace. Tribes that have had eggs or hatchlings stolen have long memories and sometimes take revenge against the thief at a later date. Captive aarakocra join any tribe they come in contact with.</p><p>Athasian aarakocra have a natural life span of 21-30 years.</p>\n","images":["<img src=\"grf/ds.gif\" width=\"150\" height=\"75\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Dark Sun\" title=\"Dark Sun\" align=\"right\">","<img src=\"img/aarakath.gif\" alt=\"Aarakocra (Athas)\" title=\"Aarakocra (Athas)\" border=\"0\" width=\"300\" height=\"360\" style=\"text-align:right;\" align=\"right\">","<img src=\"grf/add2_01.gif\" width=\"200\" height=\"56\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Advanced Dungeons & Dragons 2nd Edition\">"],"setting":"Dark Sun","statblock":{"Aarakocra (Athas)":{"Activity Cycle":"Day","Alignment":"Any","Armor Class":"7","Climate/Terrain":"Deep desert","Damage/Attack":"1d3/1d3 or by weapon","Diet":"Carnivore","Frequency":"Rare","Hit Dice":"2+2","Intelligence":"Average (8-10)","Magic Resistance":"Nil","Morale":"Steady (11)","Movement":"6, Fl 36 (C)","No. Appearing":"1d10","No. of Attacks":"2","Organization":"Tribal","Size":"M (20'+ wingspan)","Special Attacks":"Nil","Special Defenses":"Nil","THAC0":"17","Treasure":"Varies","XP Value":"65"}},"title":"Aarakocra (Athas)"},"sources":["2433"],"statblock_names":[],"title":"Aarakocra (Athas)","prev_key":"zygraat","next_key":"aarakocr","monster_path":"/appendix/aarakath"}}},"pageContext":{"monster_key":"magen","monster_data":{"TSR":["2501"],"fullBody":"  <table cellspacing=\"0\" cellpadding=\"0\"><tr class=\"bk\"><th> </th><th class=\"cn\">Demos</th><th class=\"cn\">Caldron</th><th class=\"cn\">Galvan</th><th class=\"cn\">Hypnos</th></tr><tr><th>Climate/Terrain:</th><td>Very rare</td><td>Any</td><td>Any</td><td>Any</td></tr><tr><th>Frequency:</th><td>Any</td><td>Very rare</td><td>Very rare</td><td>Very rare</td></tr><tr><th>Organization:</th><td>Solitary</td><td>Solitary</td><td>Solitary</td><td>Solitary</td></tr><tr><th>Activity Cycle:</th><td>Any</td><td>Any</td><td>Any</td><td>Any</td></tr><tr><th>Diet:</th><td>Nil</td><td>Nil</td><td>Nil</td><td>Nil</td></tr><tr><th>Intelligence:</th><td>Average (9)</td><td>Average (9)</td><td>Average (9)</td><td>Average (9)</td></tr><tr><th>Treasure:</th><td>C</td><td>V</td><td>C</td><td>U</td></tr><tr><th>Alignment:</th><td>Neutral</td><td>Neutral</td><td>Neutral</td><td>Neutral</td></tr><tr><th>No. Appearing:</th><td>2d6</td><td>1d4</td><td>1d3</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><th>Armor Class:</th><td>7 or armor type</td><td>5</td><td>3</td><td>7</td></tr><tr><th>Movement:</th><td>12</td><td>12</td><td>12</td><td>12</td></tr><tr><th>Hit Dice:</th><td>3+2</td><td>4</td><td>5</td><td>2</td></tr><tr><th>THAC0:</th><td>17</td><td>17</td><td>15</td><td>19</td></tr><tr><th>No. of Attacks:</th><td>1</td><td>1</td><td>1</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><th>Damage/Attack:</th><td>By weapon</td><td>By weapon</td><td>By weapon</td><td>By weapon</td></tr><tr><th>Special Attacks:</th><td>Nil</td><td>Entanglement, acid</td><td>Lightning bolt</td><td>Charm</td></tr><tr><th>Special Defenses:</th><td>Spell immunities</td><td>Spell immunities</td><td>Spell immunities</td><td>Spell immunities</td></tr><tr><th>Magic Resistance:</th><td>30%</td><td>40%</td><td>50%</td><td>20%</td></tr><tr><th>Size:</th><td>M (6' tall)</td><td>M (6' tall)</td><td>M (6' tall)</td><td>M (6' tall)</td></tr><tr><th>Morale:</th><td>Fearless (20)</td><td>Fearless (20)</td><td>Fearless (20)</td><td>Fearless (20)</td></tr><tr><th>XP Value:</th><td>120</td><td>175</td><td>420</td><td>175</td></tr></table><p class=\"f\">Magens (pronounced &ldquo;MAY jens&rdquo;, originally gens magica, or &ldquo;magical people&rdquo;) are constructs created by wizards of at least 12th level by means of complex conjurarions and strict and obscure alchemical formulas. The procedure for creating a magen varies depending on its type; some magens require extra work. In general, a wizard must anticipate a large expenditure of time and money.</p><p>Wizards construct magens out of a magically charged gelatin using shaped molds. Magens usually resemble perfectly formed humans, though some vain wizards fashion the magen faces to mirror their own. Wizards never shape them to resemble animals or monsters, but sometimes give them bestial features. The creatures typically look grayish white, unless they are painted or otherwise decorated. Their smooth bodies can gain texture or the semblance of hair through the work of a skilled artisan. Magens feel warm to touch, with a consistency similar to that of human flesh. While these creatures might look alive, sages do not consider them living beings; they do not sleep or eat, nor do they have emotions or free will.</p><p>When created, a magen automatically knows how to speak one language its creator knows and has chosen for it. It can learn one or two other languages later, if taught.</p><p>A magen follows its creator's commands without question, even to the death: it makes an ideal guard. Unlike most other constructs, these creatures can follow detailed commands and learn complex procedures to the same extent as a human of average intelligence. Magens even can be instructed in making simple decisions, if given criteria by which to judge events.</p><p>While the magens here represent all known types, experimentation continues - powerful wizards might create new types at any time.</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Combat:</b> Combat: A magen can be taught to use one or more weapons and employ them most frequently in attacks. Caldrons, galvans, and hypnos also have special attack forms.</p><p>Demos magens use armor and weapons to serve their masters. Their creators give them the skill to use one type of melee weapon and one type of missile weapon; they can be taught more types later. If they wear armor, they enjoy the benefit of the appropriate Armor Class, provided it exceeds their natural AC 7. No other type of magen uses armor.</p><p>Caldrons have the ability to stretch their arms and legs up to 20 feet. They do not attack with their legs, but can stretch them to reach otherwise inaccessible places. Caldrons attempt to wrap their arms around victims and can use both arms in the same round, attacking one or two opponents. After a successful  attack roll, the caldron holds the victim and secretes a powerful acid that causes 1d10 points of damage per round until the victim is freed. Breaking free requires a successful open doors roll or the death of the caldron. Note that the acid can destroy a victim's items unless saving throws are made for them.</p><p>Galvans have the ability to store static electricity, which they discharge as lighting bolts 60 feet long and 5 feet wide. Those in the area of effect suffer 3d6 points of damage, though a successful saving throw vs. breath weapon halves the damage. Galvans can discharge up to three bolts a day.</p><p>Hypnos, physically the weakest magen, possess a subtle power that makes them very useful, especially considering how hard it is to tell magen types apart. Hypnos can attempt to use <i>charm person</i> once per round; a victim who fails a saving throw vs. spells believes the hypnos to be a valued friend. One who makes a successful saving throw against the enchantment remains forever immune to the charm power of that particular magen. Once per round, the hypnos can contact a single <i>charmed</i> victim telepathically and use a <i>suggestion</i> spell; a target may attempt a saving throw vs. spell to avoid following the <i>suggestion</i>, but if the saving throw fails, the victim follows any reasonable course of action the magcn suggests. The hypnos bases its <i>suggestions</i> only on instructions from its creator.</p><p>All magens are immune to <i>charm</i> and <i>fear</i> spells, as well as to most other mind-affecting spells that affect emotions. The creatures can fall victim to <i>hold</i> and <i>sleep</i> spells.</p><p>When a magen reaches 0 hit points, its body dissolves suddenly in an acid burst of multicolored flame and smoke. One round later, no traces of the creature remain - even the odor has faded. It seems almost as if such a being was never there at all.</p><p>Should a magen's creator die, the construct almost always goes mad, launching itself on a rampage of senseless destruction until it is destroyed.</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Habitat/Society:</b> Magens have no society of their own. However, they are reasonably intelligent and can speak; some lonely wizards teach them to respond to conversation and to act in a polite manner, too. Since they have no will of their own, magens never truly become part of society, except perhaps as slaves. While the constructs have no emotions, they can be taught to emulate them in certain instances.</p><p>Demos are the most common type of magen. Their lack of special powers makes them good choices as aides in polite company; wizards generally use only this type as domestic servants and consider them excellent bodyguards as well.</p><p>One hardly ever sees caldrons used as messengers or domestic help, because of their slight acidic smell and their unsettling ability to stretch their limbs.</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Ecology:</b> The ageless magens exist purely through magic and do nor ned air, water, food, or sleep. As constructs that consume nothing, magens have little impact on their surroundings, except as potentially destructive forces.</p><p>Most scholars and sages agree that magens were developed by an impatient wizard or wizards who wanted to make a construct, but did not want to wait to gain the considerable power needed to create a <a href=\"/appendix/golem\">golem</a>. Certainly, magens are not as powerful as golems, and it takes less effort, money, and experience to create them. Some believe wizards developed magens merely as practice before attempting to create golems. Magens have greater intelligence than golems, however, and sometimes can pass for human.</p><p> Some speculate that the Immortals of Mystara handed down the knowledge of creating magens to early wizards, but this theory cannot be confirmed.</p><p>All magens are composed of the same basic material: a liquid suspension charged with magic - think of a magically charged gelatin. The liquid's actual composition varies, but all ingredients prove exotic and hard to come by, except in a large city with a well-stocked mage's guild, alchemical college, or components store.</p><p>The wizard creating a magen must have a fully stocked laboratory at his disposal, including 1,000 gold pieces worth of special tools and equipment needed to create magens. In addition, a mold must be fashioned of electrum; most wizards hire a metal-smith or sculptor to help with it. Building the mold takes at least six weeks (more for finer work) and materials and labor worth 15,000 gold pieces (or as low as 10,000 gold pieces if the wizard has the appropriate facilities and skills to help in the task),</p><p>To make a magen, the wizard also must purchase 3,000 gold pieces worth of chemicals and obscure components for the suspension. The liquid takes two weeds to prepare, and during that time the wizard concentrates so steadily on enchanting and mixing it, he can do nothing else save eat, sleep, and rest.</p><p>Once the wizard has prepared the suspension, he must add certain unique ingredients, depending on the type of magen desired. To prepare a demos, the wizard must add the melee and missile weapons he wants the completed magen to know how to use. To form a caldron, the creator adds a pair of tentacles from a <a href=\"/appendix/roper\">roper</a> or <a href=\"/appendix/choker\">choker</a>. Building a galvan requires a part of any creature that can generate electricity or lightning bolts. Finally, to create a hypnos, the wizard must liquify a scroll holding a <i>charm person</i> spell and pour it into the mixture.</p><p>The wizard transfers the prepared liquid to the mold and casts the following spells rapidly in this order: <i>lighting bolt</i>, <i>fabricate</i>, <i>transmute mud to rock</i>, <i>stone to flesh</i>, <i>domination</i> and <i>lightning bolt</i> again. The tremendous energy of the spells interacts with the gel; roll 1d20 and check the following table for the outcome.</p><table class=\"ip\"><tr class=\"bk\"><th>Roll</th><th>Result</th></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>Lightning bolt spell reflects back at the caster. Failed.</td></tr><tr><td>2-3</td><td>Mixture and mold explode, causing 4d6 points of damage to everyone in a 10-foot radius. Failed.</td></tr><tr><td>4-6</td><td>Nothing happens.

What the wizard does not know, however, is that an evil intelligence from the Outer Planes possessed its body and eventually will turn the creature against the wizard.</td></tr></table><p>The equipment, tools, and mold can be reused after the first construction. If a wizard tries to use the mold to create a different type of magen than it previously produced, the attempt automatically fails. Each reuse of a mold requires a saving throw vs. lightning. Failure indicates the mold breaks during the final spellcasting. If breakage occurs, yet the 1d20 roll indicates success, there is a slight (5%) chance that the magen emerges perfectly formed - and fully self-aware, not subject to the wizard's command! But usually, a broken mold results in a misshapen magen that dissolves into nothing within a few minutes.</p>\n","images":["<img src=\"grf/ms.gif\" width=\"150\" height=\"75\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Mystara\" title=\"Mystara\" align=\"right\">","<img src=\"img/magen.gif\" alt=\"Magen\" title=\"Magen\" border=\"0\" width=\"300\" height=\"360\" style=\"text-align:right;\" align=\"right\">","<img src=\"grf/add2_01.gif\" width=\"200\" height=\"56\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Advanced Dungeons & Dragons 2nd Edition\">"],"setting":"Mystara","statblock":{"Caldron":{"Activity Cycle":"Any","Alignment":"Neutral","Armor Class":"5","Climate/Terrain":"Any","Damage/Attack":"By weapon","Diet":"Nil","Frequency":"Very rare","Hit Dice":"4","Intelligence":"Average (9)","Magic Resistance":"40%","Morale":"Fearless (20)","Movement":"12","No. Appearing":"1d4","No. of Attacks":"1","Organization":"Solitary","Size":"M (6' tall)","Special Attacks":"Entanglement, acid","Special Defenses":"Spell immunities","THAC0":"17","Treasure":"V","XP Value":"175"},"Demos":{"Activity Cycle":"Any","Alignment":"Neutral","Armor Class":"7 or armor type","Climate/Terrain":"Very rare","Damage/Attack":"By weapon","Diet":"Nil","Frequency":"Any","Hit Dice":"3+2","Intelligence":"Average (9)","Magic Resistance":"30%","Morale":"Fearless (20)","Movement":"12","No. Appearing":"2d6","No. of Attacks":"1","Organization":"Solitary","Size":"M (6' tall)","Special Attacks":"Nil","Special Defenses":"Spell immunities","THAC0":"17","Treasure":"C","XP Value":"120"},"Galvan":{"Activity Cycle":"Any","Alignment":"Neutral","Armor Class":"3","Climate/Terrain":"Any","Damage/Attack":"By weapon","Diet":"Nil","Frequency":"Very rare","Hit Dice":"5","Intelligence":"Average (9)","Magic Resistance":"50%","Morale":"Fearless (20)","Movement":"12","No. Appearing":"1d3","No. of Attacks":"1","Organization":"Solitary","Size":"M (6' tall)","Special Attacks":"Lightning bolt","Special Defenses":"Spell immunities","THAC0":"15","Treasure":"C","XP Value":"420"},"Hypnos":{"Activity Cycle":"Any","Alignment":"Neutral","Armor Class":"7","Climate/Terrain":"Any","Damage/Attack":"By weapon","Diet":"Nil","Frequency":"Very rare","Hit Dice":"2","Intelligence":"Average (9)","Magic Resistance":"20%","Morale":"Fearless (20)","Movement":"12","No. Appearing":"1","No. of Attacks":"1","Organization":"Solitary","Size":"M (6' tall)","Special Attacks":"Charm","Special Defenses":"Spell immunities","THAC0":"19","Treasure":"U","XP Value":"175"}},"title":"Magen"},"sources":["2501"],"statblock_names":[],"title":"Magen","prev_key":"magedoom","next_key":"magman","monster_path":"/appendix/magen"}},"staticQueryHashes":[],"slicesMap":{}}
