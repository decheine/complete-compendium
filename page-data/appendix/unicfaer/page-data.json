They are smaller than other <a href=\"/appendix/unicorn\">unicorns</a> (3-4' tall).</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Combat:</b> Faerie unicorns or faerie steeds are seldom seen. This is because they can blend into their backgrounds in a manner similar to a chameleon. They can do this at will, with results identical to a creature wearing a <i>cloak of elvenkind</i>. They share a sylvan unicorn's ability to move silently in natural terrain. Once per day, a faerie unicorn can cast the following spells: <i>charm person or mammal</i>, and <i>animal summoning I, II, and III</i> (four spells total).</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Habitat/Society:</b> Faerie unicorns are similar in habitat and society to sylvan unicorns. Their neutral nature causes them to shun outside contact; it is very unlikely that a faerie steed will attack hunters or predators in its territory. However, wanton or senseless destruction of the flora and fauna in a faerie steeds demesnes will raise its ire. Alternately, acts of courage in defense of the same lands often wins the faerie steed's gratitude.</p><p>Faerie steeds can be ridden by <a href=\"/appendix/halfling\">halflings</a>, <a href=\"/appendix/gnome\"gnomes</a>, <a href=\"/appendix/elf\">elves</a>, or other faerie denizens of either sex who prove themselves worthy.</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Ecology:</b> Faerie unicorns are identical in ecology to sylvan unicorns. Once every 100 years or so, a faerie steed will shed its horn to grow a new one. The horn regrows in 3-12 days. The discarded horns are prized by elves, because the horns can be crushed to produce the dye used in the manufacture of <i>cloaks of elvenkind</i>.</p><br clear=\"all\" style=\"clear:both; height:0;\">\r\n","images":["<img src=\"grf/dr.gif\" width=\"150\" height=\"75\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Dragon Magazine\" title=\"Dragon Magazine\" align=\"right\">","<img src=\"grf/add2_01.gif\" width=\"200\" height=\"56\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Advanced Dungeons & Dragons 2nd Edition\">"],"setting":"Dragon Magazine","statblock":{"Unicorn, Faerie":{"Activity Cycle":"Day","Alignment":"Neutral","Armor Class":"2","Climate/Terrain":"Temperate Woodlands","Damage/Attack":"1-6/1-6/1-12","Diet":"Herbivore","Frequency":"Very rare","Hit Dice":"4+4","Intelligence":"Average (8-10)","Magic Resistance":"20%","Morale":"Champion (15-16)","Movement":"30","No. Appearing":"1-6","No. of Attacks":"3","Organization":"Family","Size":"L","Special Attacks":"See below","Special Defenses":"See below","THAC0":"17","Treasure":"Xx2","XP Value":"2,000"}},"title":"Unicorn, Faerie"},"sources":["Dragon#190"],"statblock_names":[],"title":"Unicorn, Faerie","prev_key":"uniccunn","next_key":"unicgray","monster_path":"/appendix/unicfaer"}},"staticQueryHashes":[],"slicesMap":{}}
