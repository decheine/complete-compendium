While the powers listed above are the most common, some aarakocra have different or additional powers.</p><p class=\"f\">A race of intelligent, birdlike creatures living in the deepest deserts of Athas, the rare Athasian <a href=\"/appendix/aarakocr\">aarakocra</a> spends its time soaring on thermals in search of food.</p><p>The aarakocra is 7 to 8 feet tall with a wingspan of 20 feet or more. Because of its large wingspan, an aarakocra can carry as much as 75% of its own body weight and still fly easily. An aarakocra can fly a short distance carrying a burden equaling 125% of its own body weight. The average body weight of a full grown male is 100 pounds and a female is 85 pounds.</p><p>Each wing has a &ldquo;hand&rdquo; at its midpoint, consisting of three fingers and an opposable thumb. The fourth finger forms the rigid leading edge of the wing. In flight the hands cannot be used, but on the ground the aarakocra can use its hands almost as a human would. The aarakocra's body is protected by a thin bony plate on the chest, much like a solid rib cage. Talons on its legs can be used as claws and can be retracted to reveal a second set of hands, also with three fingers and an opposable thumb. Except for the chest plate, the entire skeleton is hollow and extremely fragile.</p><p>From a distance, the Athasian aarakocra resembles a huge <a href=\"/appendix/bird\">vulture</a>. Its black eyes, set in the front of the head, provide excellent vision over a long range. The plumage is generally black with a white collar for adult males and black or brown with a smaller white collar for females. Adolescents are a mixture of brown and black. The beak is large and covers most of the head. Plumage begins at the crown of the head and is darker near the head, except for the collar. Athasian aarakocra speak their own language and the languages of vultures and other large birds. Some speak the common tongue (5% to 10% chance depending on how deep in the wastelands a tribe lives).</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Combat:</b> Aarakocra can fight in the air or on the ground. They prefer aerial combat since their bones are too fragile to withstand a solid blow from a human-sized opponent. In combat against creatures on the ground, they prefer to fly over their victim and drop weighted nets. Some aarakocra use darts to harass ground-based opponents.</p><p>If their opponents can fly, the aarakocra generally forgo the use of the net, although large groups sometimes use nets on flying creatures. Normally, aarakocra attack flying creatures with long spears, diving from above and allowing the momentum to carry the spear through the target. Such an attack doubles the damage if the aarakocra have been able to dive at least 50 feet. Only the very largest aarakocra can carry more than one of these spears, they can attack with both at once with no penalty, causing double damage on each strike. All diving attacks are made at +4 and should be treated as a charge attack. All other penalties and restrictions of charge attacks apply.</p><p>The effect of the aarakocra's nets depends on if the opponent is flying at the time it becomes entangled. Creatures on the ground that are hit by a net are entangled and unable to participate in any combat until they make a successful Strength check to get free of the net. Flying creatures hit by a net can no longer fly and immediately begin falling. If they cannot escape the net or use some magical means to arrest the fall, normal falling damage applies.</p><p>Unless victims are entangled in nets, aarakocra are cautious in ground combat. If the aarakocra outnumber their opponents they advance in a straight line and thrust with their spears. If outnumbered, or the opponents are particularly tough, the aarakocra withdraw. Victims entangled in nets are killed or incapacitated for use as food or ransom.</p><p>Athasian aarakocra are mindful of their physical limitations as well as their comparatively low psionic abilities. They do not normally initiate psionic combat. At the first sign of psionic powers from any of their victims, however, all aarakocra that have some ability will use whatever attack and defense modes they can in an attempt to destroy the threat. Large groups of is or more aarakocra may initiate psionic combat if their leaders feel they can win quickly and avoid physical combat.</p><p>In desperation, an aarakocra can attempt to bite an opponent in combat. Because of the unwieldiness of its beak, the aarakocra has a THAC0 of 18 if attacking with this appendage. Further, the birdman causes only 1d2 points of damage with the beak.</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Habitat/Society:</b> Athasian aarakocra live in tribes with 6-20 (2d8+4) members, depending on the prestige of the leader. The largest tribe ever recorded had 50 members. The tribal hunting territory depends on the size of the tribe, usually about 500 square miles for a tribe of 10 members. There are no rigid boundaries between tribes and border disputes are not uncommon.</p><p>Alignments of tribe members are similar to the alignment of the leader. A tribe that has a leader who is neutral good may have neutral good, chaotic good, lawful good, and true neutral members. A predominantly evil tribe does not recognize boundaries with other tribes and treats other tribes as inferior beings to be eliminated.</p><p>Athasian aarakocra aren't happy in enclosed spaces, but they they take refuge in a cave or building if necessary.</p><p>Nonevil tribes live in rocky aeries in the highest peaks they can find. Evil tribes are normally nomadic and use an aerie made by another tribe if they need to remain in an area for a long time, even if they have to evict the tribe that made the nest.</p><p>Aarakocra aren't friendly toward intruders in their territory, especially caravans. They try to extract a toll from the caravan for passage through the desert. Good-aligned tribes allow unhindered passage of caravans that pay a tribute. If someone refuses to pay the tribute, the aarakocra try to capture scouts or outriders from the party and hold them until an even larger tribute is paid. The payment may be either livestock or shiny objects. Aarakocra are smart enough not to be taken in by glass baubles instead of gems, although they cannot tell the difference between the more common gems and the rare ones.</p><p>Evil tribes ask for tribute and often attack a caravan whether it pays or not. Aarakocra always demand shiny objects such as stones. These tribes find humans and demihumans to be quite tasty and prefer them to other food.</p><p>Good-aligned tribes of aarakocra sometimes return a lost traveler to the edge of the desert after first removing any valuables the traveler may be carrying. On very rare occasions a tribe might return a lost group of travelers to the more frequently traveled parts of the desert, again after first taking any valuables as payment.</p><p>The oldest male is the leader of the tribal hunting party and has 4+4 Hit Dice. The oldest female is in charge of the tribal aerie and has 3+3 HD. In tribes that have more than 15 members, the next oldest aarakocra serves as shaman and has 3+3 HD; the shaman completes the triumvirate necessary for proper worship and the summoning of elementals. (Interestingly, no magic-using aarakocra has ever been recorded.) Tribes without a shaman cannot summon <a href=\"/appendix/element1\">air elementals</a>, which is an important part of aarakocra culture.</p><p>The shaman is the leader of the daily sun worship. Aarakocra worship the sun because it provides them with the thermals they need to soar in search of food. The shaman also leads the mystic rituals used to summon an air elemental. Summoning an air elemental is usually done only in preparation for the tribe's most sacred ceremony, the hunt. Small tribes must band together for this ceremony to allow the triumvirate to be formed.</p><p>The ceremony to summon an air elemental must be conducted at dawn and requires the oldest male and female to emit a highpitched keening whistle. The shaman conducts an intricate dance around them, simultaneously chanting an ancient summoning mantra.</p><p>The hunt is the final part of the initiation of adolescent aarakocra to adulthood and often takes the tribe far from their normal teritory. The target is always a <a href=\"/appendix/drakalsi\">silt drake</a>. The hunt is the only time the females leave the relative safety of the nest. Even an evil tribe will not interfere with a tribe on a hunt. An air elemental is often summoned to help find the drake, but never takes part in the actual combat. Although the adult members of the tribe take part in the initial phases of the combat, it is the initiates who deliver the final, killing blows to me drake. Scars from the hunt are considered a mark of pride among all aarakocra.</p><p>The females spend about eight months of the year incubating their eggs. Athasian aarakocra mate for life and a pair normally produces as many as 10 offspring. A female lays one egg a year. Constant incubation is not required because of the high daytime temperatures, so the females can maintain the nest and keep the tribe's treasure in order.</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Ecology:</b> Athasian aarakocra are high on the food chain and have no natural enemies other than <a href=\"/appendix/drakatha\">drakes</a>. Unless evil, aarakocra leave their own territory only to hunt the silt drake and return as soon as possible when the hunt is over. (Evil aarakocra attack others, as noted above.) Aarakocra eggs and hatchlings are sought after by wealthy land owners who wish to use the creatures as scouts and sentries. An egg can bring as much as 10 cp in Tyr's marketplace. Tribes that have had eggs or hatchlings stolen have long memories and sometimes take revenge against the thief at a later date. Captive aarakocra join any tribe they come in contact with.</p><p>Athasian aarakocra have a natural life span of 21-30 years.</p><p></p><br clear=\"all\" style=\"clear:both; height:0;\">\r\n","images":["<img src=\"grf/ds.gif\" width=\"150\" height=\"75\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Dark Sun\" title=\"Dark Sun\" align=\"right\">","<img src=\"img/aarakath.gif\" alt=\"Aarakocra (Athas)\" title=\"Aarakocra (Athas)\" border=\"0\" width=\"300\" height=\"360\" style=\"text-align:right;\" align=\"right\">","<img src=\"grf/add2_01.gif\" width=\"200\" height=\"56\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Advanced Dungeons & Dragons 2nd Edition\">"],"setting":"Dark Sun","statblock":{"Aarakocra (Athas)":{"Activity Cycle":"Day","Alignment":"Any","Armor Class":"7","Climate/Terrain":"Deep desert","Damage/Attack":"1d3/1d3 or by weapon","Diet":"Carnivore","Frequency":"Rare","Hit Dice":"2+2","Intelligence":"Average (8-10)","Magic Resistance":"Nil","Morale":"Steady (11)","Movement":"6, Fl 36 (C)","No. Appearing":"1d10","No. of Attacks":"2","Organization":"Tribal","Size":"M (20'+ wingspan)","Special Attacks":"Nil","Special Defenses":"Nil","THAC0":"17","Treasure":"Varies","XP Value":"65"}},"title":"Aarakocra (Athas)"},"sources":["2433"],"statblock_names":[],"title":"Aarakocra (Athas)","prev_key":"zygraat","next_key":"aarakocr","monster_path":"/appendix/aarakath"}}},"pageContext":{"monster_key":"geninoda","monster_data":{"TSR":["2129"],"fullBody":"  <table cellspacing=\"0\" cellpadding=\"0\"><tr><th>Climate/Terrain:</th><td>Elemental earth, mountains</td></tr><tr><th>Frequency:</th><td>Very rare</td></tr><tr><th>Organization:</th><td>Khanate</td></tr><tr><th>Activity Cycle:</th><td>Day</td></tr><tr><th>Diet:</th><td>Omnivore</td></tr><tr><th>Intelligence:</th><td>Very to Exceptional (11-16)</td></tr><tr><th>Treasure:</th><td>U,Q(&times;10)</td></tr><tr><th>Alignment:</th><td>Neutral evil</td></tr><tr><th>No. Appearing:</th><td>1</td></tr><tr><th>Armor Class:</th><td>0</td></tr><tr><th>Movement:</th><td>12, Fl 21 (B), Br 9</td></tr><tr><th>Hit Dice:</th><td>12+3</td></tr><tr><th>THAC0:</th><td>7</td></tr><tr><th>No. of Attacks:</th><td>2</td></tr><tr><th>Damage/Attack:</th><td>4-24/4-24</td></tr><tr><th>Special Attacks:</th><td>See below</td></tr><tr><th>Special Defenses:</th><td>See below</td></tr><tr><th>Magic Resistance:</th><td>20%</td></tr><tr><th>Size:</th><td>L (12' tall)</td></tr><tr><th>Morale:</th><td>Fanatic (17-18)</td></tr><tr><th>XP Value:</th><td>11,000</td></tr></table><p class=\"f\">Noble dao are the rulers of the <a href=\"/appendix/genie\">genies</a> from the Elemental Plane of Earth. They command <a href=\"/appendix/element1\">earth elementals</a>, <a href=\"/appendix/genie\">dao</a>, <a href=\"/appendix/xorn\">xorn</a>, and other slaves who toil for them searching for the gems they prize. Their attitude toward all other races can best be described as callous.</p><p>Noble dao are bald and squat, and both sexes are fond of earrings, turbans, and heavy necklaces. Male dao nobles are fond of beards and moustaches, which they take great pride in and often sculpt into ridiculous points, curls, and blocky forms. Their skin varies in all the colors of earth and stone, from grey and brown to tan, white, and ebony. Their ears are pointed and their retractable fingernails are unnaturally durable claws of pure metal, capable of tearing through flesh and armor. These nails give their fingers a pudginess and a stiffness of movement that remains with them even in other forms.</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Combat:</b> Dao enjoy combat only when they already know the result. Their stratagems and plans for both melee and war revolve around stacking the deck in their favor as overwhelmingly as possible before a dispute even begins. They are great fans of spies, bribery, and mercenaries and will never fight any battle when someone else can be paid to do it and suffer the losses. However, when forced to defend themselves, noble dao are rarely unprepared. They generally seek to summon reinforcements and delay opponents while a crushing counterattack or ambush is prepared.</p><p>Noble dao can use any of the following spell-like abilities at will three times per day, one at a time: <i>change self</i>, <i>detect good</i>, <i>detect magic</i>, <i>assume gaseous form</i>, <i>polymorph self</i>, <i>become invisible</i>, fulfill the <i>wish</i> of a creature from the Prime Material Plane (in a perverse way), <i>cause misdirection</i>, <i>passwall</i>, create a <i>spectral force</i>, and create a <i>wall of stone</i>. Noble dao can cast <i>sand whisper</i> and <i>dust curtain</i> at will, <i>turn rock to mud</i> six times per day, and <i>dig</i> a dozen times per day. They can also cast <i>repulsion</i>, <i>stoneskin</i>, and <i>domination</i> once per day. Noble dao perform all magic at the 24th level of spell use. When in gaseous form, noble dao resemble a dusty cloud or sandstorm.</p><p>It is possible for dao nobles to carry up to 2,000 pounds without tiring. Double weight will cause tiring within three turns. (For every 200 pounds of weight under 4,000 the dao may add one turn to the duration of its carrying ability.) After tiring, a noble dao must rest for six turns. Note that dao can move through earth (not worked stone) at a burrowing rate of 9. They cannot take living creatures with them.</p><p>Noble dao are unaffected by all earth magics, but take three times normal damage from holy water. They are also immune to <i>maze</i> spells.</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Habitat/Society:</b> Noble dao rule various rifts of the Great Dismal Delve in the Plane of Elemental Earth, although many of them spend much of their time at the side of the khan who rules them all. Stately processions between their rift estates and the court of the khan occur frequently; in times of unrest dozens of noble processions may wind their way across the Great Dismal Delve every day as dao nobles attempt to protect their estates, possessions, mining dispensations, and trading rights from infringement or destruction. A dao mazework far from the Sevenfold Mazework is usually home to 1-6 noble dao, 4-40 common dao, and 8-80 elemental and nonelemental slaves - vassals, servants, and miners who continually expand the dao estate.</p><p>The Great Khan of the Dao rules in splendor in the Sevenfold Mazework, the city at the center of the Great Dismal Delve. The noble dao vary in power from the lesser atamen and hetmen who only visit the Sevenfold Mazework to the favored seneschals. The loyalty of the ataman or hetman who acts on the advice of a seneschal is always questionable, but the seneschals are always chosen by the khan of the dao, and their loyalty is to him alone.</p><p>The miles of three-dimensional convolutions and magical distortions which make up the Sevenfold Mazework are said to confuse even minotaur slaves, but noble dao understand its windings, twists, and spirals instinctively. Since each noble is occasionally given the unavoidable honor of paying for and supervising additions to the mazework, the khan is able to expand it perpetually at very little cost to himself. More rarely, an obsolete, unfashionable, or over-traveled section is closed off and filled with rubble from new digging elsewhere. The mazework connects to pockets of all the elements, and gates connect it to the other elemental planes.</p><p>Light in the mazework is kept deliberately dim, as it is entirely lined with mica, pyrite, hematite, and carefully cut, reflective semi-precious stones.light is reflected over and over again down the corridors. Bright lights are used as alarms to instantly alert nearby chambers of some emergency. Dim colored lights serve as signals for slaves and servants to attend to the nobles.</p><p>Nobles of the court of the great khan live in self-contained sections of the Sevenfold Mazework known as halls or wings. A typical seneschal's residence might contain 1-6 male dao nobles, 2-12 female dao nobles, 4-24 common dao, 2-12 <a href=\"/appendix/minotaur\">minotaurs</a>, 10-100 elemental and nonelemental slaves. Summoned elemental creatures are either special servitors, slave overseers, or pets. The home of a minor noble dao who keeps a primary estate far away in the provincial sections of the Great Dismal Delve is typically home to half as many occupants as indicated above.</p><p>Female noble dao are responsible for the care and well-being of the slaves and the oversight of new excavations, though they may not choose where and how much to dig. This gives them considerable influence, though they are bound by custom to their mates in all other things. Some female dao are granted recognition as atamen and hetmen, but they are strictly excluded from the world of haggling and commerce (including the buying and selling of slaves). All dao consider trade too vulgar and dangerous for the female nobles to engage in. Some female dao nobles have, through special dispensations from the khan, been allowed to use their private holdings as the basis of lucrative money-lending businesses.</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Ecology:</b> Seneschal dao extract as much work from the atamen and hetmen as they can, and, likewise, atamen and hetmen push their slaves as hard as they dare. They are sharp traders, always able to turn business to their advantage; they are notoriously hard bargainers, especially with creatures not native to the Elemental Plane of Earth. They are always willing to see how far they can push a mercenary before he will betray them. Noble dao tend to see others only in terms of how much profit can be made from them or how much power can be gained over them.</p><p>Some dao take a perverse pleasure in destroying the possessions of others while increasing their own wealth and prestige. This is rare, as most noble dao would rather buy or steal a possession for themselves than destroy it. However, joy in the misfortune of others is an entrenched part of noble dao culture among the highest grades of nobles (those living in the Mazework itself). Building a new wing in the Sevenfold Mazework may become twice as difficult if the project is opposed by noble dao in wings nearby. Successful human traders have occasionally been sabotaged by envious dao. Dao nobles hate <a href=\"/appendix/genie\">marid</a> and <a href=\"/appendix/genie\">djinn</a>, but they are on speaking terms with <a href=\"/appendix/genie\">efreet</a>, who trade worked metal for minerals. All other elemental creatures are only of interest to the dao insofar as they can be exploited.</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Great Khan of the Dao</b></p>  <p class=\"ni\">The Great Khan of the Dao is also known by a multitude of titles including Ataman of the Mountains' Roots, Caravaneer of the Sevenfold Path, the Perfect Compass, the Stone Sultan, Carver of Destiny, Master of Traders, the Fountain of Wealth, and Balancer of All Earthly Accounts.</p><p>The Great Khan is always planning new engineering projects, and his followers surround him with new ideas for additions to the mazework, new caravans, financial tricks to turn greater profits on his trade routes, and inventions to increase the efficiency of his slaves. He is constantly accompanied and assisted in his work by 1-6 tasked builder genies, 3-30 common merchant dao, 2-20 common warrior dao, and 1-10 noble dao.</p><p>The Great Khan has all the abilities of a noble dao and access to all the spells of the province of sand magic once per day. In addition he may cast <i>suggestion</i> at will merely by speaking for a full round - no gestures are required. He can cast <i>maze</i> once per month. He has 25 Hit Dice and maximum hit points. The khan is immune to all weapons made of metal or stone, though wooden weapons affect him normally.</p><p>The khan is unusually fat for a dao, with none of the strength of limb that most of his nobles possess. However, his eyes are bright with schemes and he has a quick wit. He has a great interest in technological improvements such as optics, systems to transfer mechanical power from one set of belts and gears to another, alchemical findings, and developments in metallurgy and mining such as new pumps, shorings, and refining techniques.</p><p>The audience chamber of the Great Khan is called the Hidden Fulcrum of the Dao. It is hidden deep within the Sevenfold Maze, and not even all the noble dao know where it is. Visitors who desire an audience are expected to bribe guards and even noble dao to win entrance to the corridors of power. These gifts or bribes are often discussed quite bluntly, and the amounts vary from 10-80,000 gp. Once a bribe is taken, nothing may happen or the fortunate visitor may be informed (within 1-4 weeks) that a few moments of the khan's time have become available. All visitors are blindfolded and led through the mazework to the court, a process that requires several hours depending on which path is taken to the center. The khan has cunningly had the Hidden Fulcrum covered with mirrors that reflect his image all around the supplicants who visit him, so that his true location is very difficult to determine. The khan prefers to ask constant questions rather than listen to the pleading and presentations of visitors.</p><p>Supplicants are often advised to strip themselves of wealth before entering the mazework, as the khan prefers that his subjects and his audiences be humble and poor. Those poor souls who arrive resplendent in finery and jewels are generally asked to make gifts of their riches to the khan.</p><p>The Great Khan rarely leaves the environs of the Sevenfold Mazework; when he does it will be to accompany some vital caravan or to personally supervise the haggling for and obtaining of some great prize object or rare material needed for the magics found in the Mazework. (His caravans are usually comprised of 10-100 common dao and 1-3 noble dao.) The khan prefers to travel incognito when with merchant dao, as his well-known skills at appraising and haggling make others reluctant to deal with him if they recognize him.</p><p>When the Great Khan of the Dao travels to the Prime Material Plane, his arrival is always preceded by a powerful earthquake capable of shaking down fortress walls and altering the course of rivers. Once he has arrived he generally travels to the accompaniment of smaller tremors, as his processions often take him through hills and mountains rather than over them. In the desert, his procession (containing no less than 2-200 jann and 2-16 dao) creates a huge sandstorm wherever it passes.</p><p></p><br clear=\"all\" style=\"clear:both; height:0;\">\r\n","images":["<img src=\"grf/aq.gif\" width=\"150\" height=\"75\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Al-Qadim (Forgotten Realms)\" title=\"Al-Qadim (Forgotten Realms)\" align=\"right\">","<img src=\"img/geninoda.gif\" alt=\"Genie, Noble Dao\" title=\"Genie, Noble Dao\" border=\"0\" width=\"300\" height=\"360\" style=\"text-align:right;\" align=\"right\">","<img src=\"grf/add2_01.gif\" width=\"200\" height=\"56\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Advanced Dungeons & Dragons 2nd Edition\">"],"setting":"Al-Qadim (Forgotten Realms)","statblock":{"Genie, Noble Dao":{"Activity Cycle":"Day","Alignment":"Neutral evil","Armor Class":"0","Climate/Terrain":"Elemental earth, mountains","Damage/Attack":"4-24/4-24","Diet":"Omnivore","Frequency":"Very rare","Hit Dice":"12+3","Intelligence":"Very to Exceptional (11-16)","Magic Resistance":"20%","Morale":"Fanatic (17-18)","Movement":"12, Fl 21 (B), Br 9","No. Appearing":"1","No. of Attacks":"2","Organization":"Khanate","Size":"L (12' tall)","Special Attacks":"See below","Special Defenses":"See below","THAC0":"7","Treasure":"U,Q(&times;10)","XP Value":"11,000"}},"title":"Genie, Noble Dao"},"sources":["2129"],"statblock_names":[],"title":"Genie, Noble Dao","prev_key":"genie","next_key":"geninodj","monster_path":"/appendix/geninoda"}},"staticQueryHashes":[],"slicesMap":{}}
