Bulls are dangerous, being aggressive and easily aroused. A typical bull is semi-intelligent and large, standing about 5 feet at the shoulder. If approached within 80 yards, there is a 75% chance it will attack. A bull charging at least 30 yards inflicts 3d4 hit points of damage, plus an additional 1d4 points of trampling damage. When a herd is present, there will be several bulls to defend it.</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Caribou:</b> These herbivores inhabit subarctic steppes and tundra. They are generally similar to stags, except as noted. They have animal intelligence and are large, standing 4 to 5 feet at the shoulder and weighing about 700 pounds. Herds may have up to 100 animals. They are important to tribal cultures in their region: it takes about 12 skins to make a complete winter suit or a kayak, 5 to 6 hides to make a sleeping roll. Their fat is burned in oil lamps and their antlers are used for tent pegs, tool handles, chair frames, and so on.</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Goat, Giant:</b> These reclusive herbivores dwell in hilly country. They are semi-intelligent and stand 5 feet or more at the shoulder. If more than 7 are encountered, the remainder will be young. They will aggressively defend themselves against any threat. They have one attack, a butt with two sharp horns. A giant goat charging at least 30 yards adds +4 points of damage when it hits. In rare cases, these animals have been tamed as steeds.</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Hippopotamus:</b> Hippopotomi are found in the lakes and rivers of tropical regions. They are large creatures of animal intelligence. Although they are herbivores, they will aggressively defend their territory. A hippo bites with exceedingly strong jaws; a bull will inflict 3d6 points of damage. There will be 1 to 4 bulls in the herd, one for every 4 animals. If a boat or canoe passes over submerged hippopotomi, there is a 50% chance that a bull will emerge under it and tip the craft over. Hippopotomi travel underwater by running along the bottom (at a rate of 12), and can stay submerged for 15 minutes.</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Llama:</b> These sure-footed herbivores are used as pack animals in some mountainous regions. They are about 4&#189; feet high at the shoulder and weigh about 300 pounds. They can spit as <a href=\"/appendix/camel\">camels</a> when annoyed (50% chance, blinds for 1d3 rounds), and are prone to bite. They generally refuse loads over 50 pounds.</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Ram, Giant:</b> These are giant <a href=\"/appendix/mammherd\">sheep</a> found only in hilly or mountainous regions. They have animal intelligence and are large, standing about 6 feet at the shoulder. A flock will consist of a ram, four ewes, and the balance will be lambs. All full-grown specimens will conform to the statistics. Males that charge to attack will deliver a butt of double damage. They are not normally aggressive, but if they believe the flock is threatened, they will defend it to the death.</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Rhinoceros:</b> These are aggressive herbivores, found in tropical savannahs. They are large and of animal intelligence. A few types are less aggressive and will run away if they feel threatened, but most will charge. A rhinoceros that fails a morale check wilI charge 50% of the time. Rhinoceros have poor eyesight, but good hearing and smell. If more than half the possible number are encountered, 1 or 2 will be young.</p><p>A charging rhino inflicts double damage. It will also tranple any creature low enough for this action, attacking twice with its forefeet and inflicting 2d4 points of damage with each successful hit.</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Stag, wild:</b> <a href=\"/appendix/stag\">Stags</a> are herbivores found in temperate forest and meadowlands. They are the aggressive males of a herd that numbers 4 to 8 times the number of stags encountered. They are large creatures of animal intelligence. The stags will defend the herd against all but the most fearsome opponents, attacking with their branching horns or lashing out with their sharp fore-hooves.</p>\n","images":["<img src=\"grf/xx.gif\" width=\"150\" height=\"75\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Advanced Dungeons & Dragons 2nd Edition\" title=\"Advanced Dungeons & Dragons 2nd Edition\" align=\"right\">","<img src=\"grf/tsr_sm.png\" width=\"56\" height=\"59\" border=\"0\" alt=\"TSR\">"],"setting":"Advanced Dungeons & Dragons 2nd Edition","statblock":null,"title":"Mammal, Herd II"},"sources":["2158"],"statblock_names":[],"title":"Mammal, Herd II","prev_key":"mammgian","next_key":"mammherd","monster_path":"/appendix/mammher2"}},"staticQueryHashes":[],"slicesMap":{}}
