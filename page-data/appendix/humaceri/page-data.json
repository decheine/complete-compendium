While the powers listed above are the most common, some aarakocra have different or additional powers.</p><p class=\"f\">A race of intelligent, birdlike creatures living in the deepest deserts of Athas, the rare Athasian <a href=\"/appendix/aarakocr\">aarakocra</a> spends its time soaring on thermals in search of food.</p><p>The aarakocra is 7 to 8 feet tall with a wingspan of 20 feet or more. Because of its large wingspan, an aarakocra can carry as much as 75% of its own body weight and still fly easily. An aarakocra can fly a short distance carrying a burden equaling 125% of its own body weight. The average body weight of a full grown male is 100 pounds and a female is 85 pounds.</p><p>Each wing has a &ldquo;hand&rdquo; at its midpoint, consisting of three fingers and an opposable thumb. The fourth finger forms the rigid leading edge of the wing. In flight the hands cannot be used, but on the ground the aarakocra can use its hands almost as a human would. The aarakocra's body is protected by a thin bony plate on the chest, much like a solid rib cage. Talons on its legs can be used as claws and can be retracted to reveal a second set of hands, also with three fingers and an opposable thumb. Except for the chest plate, the entire skeleton is hollow and extremely fragile.</p><p>From a distance, the Athasian aarakocra resembles a huge <a href=\"/appendix/bird\">vulture</a>. Its black eyes, set in the front of the head, provide excellent vision over a long range. The plumage is generally black with a white collar for adult males and black or brown with a smaller white collar for females. Adolescents are a mixture of brown and black. The beak is large and covers most of the head. Plumage begins at the crown of the head and is darker near the head, except for the collar. Athasian aarakocra speak their own language and the languages of vultures and other large birds. Some speak the common tongue (5% to 10% chance depending on how deep in the wastelands a tribe lives).</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Combat:</b> Aarakocra can fight in the air or on the ground. They prefer aerial combat since their bones are too fragile to withstand a solid blow from a human-sized opponent. In combat against creatures on the ground, they prefer to fly over their victim and drop weighted nets. Some aarakocra use darts to harass ground-based opponents.</p><p>If their opponents can fly, the aarakocra generally forgo the use of the net, although large groups sometimes use nets on flying creatures. Normally, aarakocra attack flying creatures with long spears, diving from above and allowing the momentum to carry the spear through the target. Such an attack doubles the damage if the aarakocra have been able to dive at least 50 feet. Only the very largest aarakocra can carry more than one of these spears, they can attack with both at once with no penalty, causing double damage on each strike. All diving attacks are made at +4 and should be treated as a charge attack. All other penalties and restrictions of charge attacks apply.</p><p>The effect of the aarakocra's nets depends on if the opponent is flying at the time it becomes entangled. Creatures on the ground that are hit by a net are entangled and unable to participate in any combat until they make a successful Strength check to get free of the net. Flying creatures hit by a net can no longer fly and immediately begin falling. If they cannot escape the net or use some magical means to arrest the fall, normal falling damage applies.</p><p>Unless victims are entangled in nets, aarakocra are cautious in ground combat. If the aarakocra outnumber their opponents they advance in a straight line and thrust with their spears. If outnumbered, or the opponents are particularly tough, the aarakocra withdraw. Victims entangled in nets are killed or incapacitated for use as food or ransom.</p><p>Athasian aarakocra are mindful of their physical limitations as well as their comparatively low psionic abilities. They do not normally initiate psionic combat. At the first sign of psionic powers from any of their victims, however, all aarakocra that have some ability will use whatever attack and defense modes they can in an attempt to destroy the threat. Large groups of is or more aarakocra may initiate psionic combat if their leaders feel they can win quickly and avoid physical combat.</p><p>In desperation, an aarakocra can attempt to bite an opponent in combat. Because of the unwieldiness of its beak, the aarakocra has a THAC0 of 18 if attacking with this appendage. Further, the birdman causes only 1d2 points of damage with the beak.</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Habitat/Society:</b> Athasian aarakocra live in tribes with 6-20 (2d8+4) members, depending on the prestige of the leader. The largest tribe ever recorded had 50 members. The tribal hunting territory depends on the size of the tribe, usually about 500 square miles for a tribe of 10 members. There are no rigid boundaries between tribes and border disputes are not uncommon.</p><p>Alignments of tribe members are similar to the alignment of the leader. A tribe that has a leader who is neutral good may have neutral good, chaotic good, lawful good, and true neutral members. A predominantly evil tribe does not recognize boundaries with other tribes and treats other tribes as inferior beings to be eliminated.</p><p>Athasian aarakocra aren't happy in enclosed spaces, but they they take refuge in a cave or building if necessary.</p><p>Nonevil tribes live in rocky aeries in the highest peaks they can find. Evil tribes are normally nomadic and use an aerie made by another tribe if they need to remain in an area for a long time, even if they have to evict the tribe that made the nest.</p><p>Aarakocra aren't friendly toward intruders in their territory, especially caravans. They try to extract a toll from the caravan for passage through the desert. Good-aligned tribes allow unhindered passage of caravans that pay a tribute. If someone refuses to pay the tribute, the aarakocra try to capture scouts or outriders from the party and hold them until an even larger tribute is paid. The payment may be either livestock or shiny objects. Aarakocra are smart enough not to be taken in by glass baubles instead of gems, although they cannot tell the difference between the more common gems and the rare ones.</p><p>Evil tribes ask for tribute and often attack a caravan whether it pays or not. Aarakocra always demand shiny objects such as stones. These tribes find humans and demihumans to be quite tasty and prefer them to other food.</p><p>Good-aligned tribes of aarakocra sometimes return a lost traveler to the edge of the desert after first removing any valuables the traveler may be carrying. On very rare occasions a tribe might return a lost group of travelers to the more frequently traveled parts of the desert, again after first taking any valuables as payment.</p><p>The oldest male is the leader of the tribal hunting party and has 4+4 Hit Dice. The oldest female is in charge of the tribal aerie and has 3+3 HD. In tribes that have more than 15 members, the next oldest aarakocra serves as shaman and has 3+3 HD; the shaman completes the triumvirate necessary for proper worship and the summoning of elementals. (Interestingly, no magic-using aarakocra has ever been recorded.) Tribes without a shaman cannot summon <a href=\"/appendix/element1\">air elementals</a>, which is an important part of aarakocra culture.</p><p>The shaman is the leader of the daily sun worship. Aarakocra worship the sun because it provides them with the thermals they need to soar in search of food. The shaman also leads the mystic rituals used to summon an air elemental. Summoning an air elemental is usually done only in preparation for the tribe's most sacred ceremony, the hunt. Small tribes must band together for this ceremony to allow the triumvirate to be formed.</p><p>The ceremony to summon an air elemental must be conducted at dawn and requires the oldest male and female to emit a highpitched keening whistle. The shaman conducts an intricate dance around them, simultaneously chanting an ancient summoning mantra.</p><p>The hunt is the final part of the initiation of adolescent aarakocra to adulthood and often takes the tribe far from their normal teritory. The target is always a <a href=\"/appendix/drakalsi\">silt drake</a>. The hunt is the only time the females leave the relative safety of the nest. Even an evil tribe will not interfere with a tribe on a hunt. An air elemental is often summoned to help find the drake, but never takes part in the actual combat. Although the adult members of the tribe take part in the initial phases of the combat, it is the initiates who deliver the final, killing blows to me drake. Scars from the hunt are considered a mark of pride among all aarakocra.</p><p>The females spend about eight months of the year incubating their eggs. Athasian aarakocra mate for life and a pair normally produces as many as 10 offspring. A female lays one egg a year. Constant incubation is not required because of the high daytime temperatures, so the females can maintain the nest and keep the tribe's treasure in order.</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Ecology:</b> Athasian aarakocra are high on the food chain and have no natural enemies other than <a href=\"/appendix/drakatha\">drakes</a>. Unless evil, aarakocra leave their own territory only to hunt the silt drake and return as soon as possible when the hunt is over. (Evil aarakocra attack others, as noted above.) Aarakocra eggs and hatchlings are sought after by wealthy land owners who wish to use the creatures as scouts and sentries. An egg can bring as much as 10 cp in Tyr's marketplace. Tribes that have had eggs or hatchlings stolen have long memories and sometimes take revenge against the thief at a later date. Captive aarakocra join any tribe they come in contact with.</p><p>Athasian aarakocra have a natural life span of 21-30 years.</p><br clear=\"all\" style=\"clear:both; height:0;\">\r\n","images":["<img src=\"grf/ds.gif\" width=\"150\" height=\"75\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Dark Sun\" title=\"Dark Sun\" align=\"right\">","<img src=\"img/aarakath.gif\" alt=\"Aarakocra (Athas)\" title=\"Aarakocra (Athas)\" border=\"0\" width=\"300\" height=\"360\" style=\"text-align:right;\" align=\"right\">","<img src=\"grf/add2_01.gif\" width=\"200\" height=\"56\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Advanced Dungeons & Dragons 2nd Edition\">"],"setting":"Dark Sun","statblock":{"Aarakocra (Athas)":{"Activity Cycle":"Day","Alignment":"Any","Armor Class":"7","Climate/Terrain":"Deep desert","Damage/Attack":"1d3/1d3 or by weapon","Diet":"Carnivore","Frequency":"Rare","Hit Dice":"2+2","Intelligence":"Average (8-10)","Magic Resistance":"Nil","Morale":"Steady (11)","Movement":"6, Fl 36 (C)","No. Appearing":"1d10","No. of Attacks":"2","Organization":"Tribal","Size":"M (20'+ wingspan)","Special Attacks":"Nil","Special Defenses":"Nil","THAC0":"17","Treasure":"Varies","XP Value":"65"}},"title":"Aarakocra (Athas)"},"sources":["2433"],"statblock_names":[],"title":"Aarakocra (Athas)","prev_key":"zygraat","next_key":"aarakocr","monster_path":"/appendix/aarakath"}}},"pageContext":{"monster_key":"humaceri","monster_data":{"TSR":["2166"],"fullBody":"  <table cellspacing=\"0\" cellpadding=\"0\"><tr class=\"bk\"><th> </th><th class=\"cn\">Anurien (Knight)</th><th class=\"cn\">Brecht (Tradesman)</th><th class=\"cn\">Khinasi (Soldier)</th><th class=\"cn\">Rjurik (Berserker)</th><th class=\"cn\">Vos (Mercenary)</th></tr><tr><th>Frequency:</th><td>Rare</td><td>Common</td><td>Common</td><td>Uncommon</td><td>Common</td></tr><tr><th>Treasure:</th><td>L,M</td><td>1-100 gp</td><td>I</td><td>Nil</td><td>L,M</td></tr><tr><th>Alignment:</th><td>Any lawful</td><td>Any</td><td>Any</td><td>Neutral</td><td>Lawful neutral</td></tr><tr><th>No. Appearing:</th><td>1-20</td><td>2-12</td><td>10-100</td><td>10-100</td><td>10-100</td></tr><tr><th>Armor Class:</th><td>2 or 4</td><td>8</td><td>8 to 4</td><td>8 to 6</td><td>7 to 4</td></tr><tr><th>Hit Dice:</th><td>2+</td><td>1-6 hp</td><td>1-6 hp</td><td>2-7 hp</td><td>2-8 hp</td></tr><tr><th>THAC0:</th><td>19 or less</td><td>20</td><td>20</td><td>20</td><td>20</td></tr><tr><th>Morale:</th><td>Elite (14)</td><td>Steady (11)</td><td>Steady (10)</td><td>Fearless (20)</td><td>Steady (12)</td></tr><tr><th>XP Value:</th><td>Varies</td><td>15</td><td>15</td><td>15</td><td>15</td></tr></table><p class=\"f\">This is a short guide to the humans of Cerilia, home of the <i>Birthright</i> setting. As characters from this setting venture forth, they might be encountered nearly anywhere, particularly if interworld gates or far-ranging spelljamming is common. Nearly all of the general types of humans listed in the <a href=\"/appendix/human\">Human entry</a> exist in Cerilia.</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Anuirean</b></p><p class=\"ni\">These people are native to the southwest portion of Cerilia. The ancient Anuireans were a fair-skinned, red-haired people, but they have mixed with the other Cerilians over the centuries, so that blond, brunette, and black-haired Anuireans are at least as common as the original stock.</p><p>Their culture is semifeudal and based on a class of free farmers and craftsmen. Local rulers are usually titled nobles. The Anuireans respect nobility and look to their leaders to protect them from the barbarians and savages who surround the states of the old Anuirean Empire.</p><p>Wizards are in general mistrusted, though one in the service of a noble is tolerated. Bards enjoy the role of herald and lore-keeper, and are welcomed and well-respected. A lively rural tradition includes robber barons and infamous outlaws.</p><p>Commoners identify strongly with their lords, and the dealing and alliances of the noble families are topics of continuous  discussion throughout Anuirean lands. While the squabbling feuds of petty lords prevent a return to Anuirea's lost imperial greatness, their armoes of mounted knights, well supported by men-at-arms and court mages, are difficult to beat. A typical Anuirean field force has 25-40% knights, 30-50% professional infantry (mostly pike- or spear-armed, though up to half might have longbows), and 25-40% feudal levy infantry, Both paladins and rangers might be found in such a force, though not in particularly great numbers.</p><p class=\"f\"><img src=\"/img/spc/humacer2.gif\" width=\"200\" height=\"240\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Brecht\" title=\"Brecht\" style=\"float:left;\"><b>Brecht</b></p><p class=\"ni\">These short, stocky, dark-haired people live in north-central Cerilia. Early in their history, they were under the rule of Anuirean governors. During this time, Brecht nobility declined drastically in power and importance. When the Empire fell and the Brechts gained independence, the guilds and merchants came into power. The current nobility is weak, and several states have declared themselves republics. Many Brechts are seafaring traders.</p><p>The magical arts are mistrusted, most often finding an outlet in scholarly discipolines such as alchemy or the fabrication of more mechanical inventions. Bards are viewed as wastrels, whose works are pretty, but ultimately frivolous and lacking solid value. They are tolerated, but considered a bad examule for the young.</p><p>The Brechts believe in free enterprise, and Brecht society revolves around wealth. The Brechts have a fierce love of independence and a tradition of self-reliance; they don't wait for their lords or rnlers to solve problems for them. Commerce and trade are expressions of this belief, and Brecht commoners owe their first loyalty to guilds and companies.</p><p>The Brecht are conservative and pragmatic, preferring to bargain their way out of trouble if possible. While not entirely cold to the needs of others, they tend to weigh the costs and benefits of their actions; they are not given to heedless generosity or wild gambling. They are comfortable with their own lifestyle, and slow to adopt the ways of others.</p><p>A typical Brecht field force has 10-20% bights, 40-50% professional infantry armed with pike or crossbow, and 20-30% militia. The leaders and front ranks of pikemen are the most heavily armored, and Brecht foot soldiers are generally steadier than their Anuirean counterparts. Paladins are rare, but rangers are rarer. The strength of such a force is often in its masses of pikes, though lighter raiding forces might be landed by sea to harry the coastal towns and farmlands of a foe.</p><p class=\"f\"><img src=\"/img/spc/humacer3.gif\" width=\"200\" height=\"240\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Khinasi\" title=\"Khinasi\" style=\"float:right;\"><b>Khinasi</b></p><p class=\"ni\">These people come from the region called Khinasi and speak a language called Basarii. They are tall and lanky, with aquiline features and dark eyes. Their complexions range from a light coffee to a dark brown.</p><p>Men wear loosrfitting breeches of light colored linen or silk, a broad sash of colorful fabric, and a tight-fitting high-collared shirt with half- or three-quarter length sleeves. Colorful vests are common and wealthy men wear lavishly decorated shoes. Women's dress is similar, but cover the legs to the ankle and arms to the wrist for decency. It is considered improper for either gender to appear in public without a head covering, generally a cap, scarf, turban, or light veil.</p><p>Unlike the other human cultures of Cerilia, the Khinasi have no fear of magic. The study of magic is considered the noblest of callings, but raising or communicating with the dead is strictly forbidden.</p><p>Khinasi bards are not respected, being mostly poor wanderers of dubious honesty. They lack the status of Anuirean bards, and are commonly considered vagrants and thieves. Professional storytellers, however, are highly respected.</p><p>Thieves' guilds are vigorously rooted out by Khinasi city governments, though some operate succesfully. The culture has a long tradition of hidden cults and guilds of assassins, though most Khinasi view their activities with horror.</p><p>Like the Brechts, Khinasi commoners are traders and merchants, but an individual's decorum, hospitality, conduct, and ability to entertain lavishly are far more important than wealth. Piety, politeness, and eloquence mark high breeding and wisdom, and Khinasi disputes are marvels of suggestion. Khinasi agpssively assimilate aspects of other cnltures they find useful, yet maintain a core lifestyle that is their own.</p><p>Many Khinasi sprinkle everyday speech with brief prayers for success in routine ventures, blessings on passing strangers, and invocations of divine favor for great enterprises. Swearing in a deity's name is a horribly crude and barbaric act. Slavery is unknown; a person of skill might rise without limit with hard work and a little luck. Khinasi rulers are skilled in diplomacy and subtle. The highest noble titles include emir, satrap, sultan, and khan.</p><p>In war, the nobles fight as mailed cavalry mounted on medium horses, armed with lance, scimitar (or saber), and javelins. Khinasi professional warriors wear chain mail and carry scimitars, while Khinasi militia is generally unarmored. Typical militia weapons include spears, clubs, daggers, and composite bows. Seafarers and herders typically wear leather armor and might carry a cutlass or short sword, sling, or dagger.</p><p>A typical Khinasi field force has 30% medium cavalry, 20-30% light cavalry, and 40-50% split between spear-armed militia levies, archery, and irregular light troops such as hillmen or marines. Paladins are as common as in Anuirean armies, rangers tend to be from hills or deserts instead of forests.</p><p class=\"f\"><img src=\"/img/spc/humacer4.gif\" width=\"200\" height=\"240\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Rjurik\" title=\"Rjurik\" style=\"float:left;\"><b>Rjurik</b></p><p class=\"ni\">These tall, broad-shouldered people live in the forests and highlands of northwestern Cerilia. They have blond or red hair and fair complexions. Men and women most commonly wear their hair in long braids.</p><p>The Rjurik are stubborn individualists who don't swear fealty to anyone but their own kin; the family is the most important part of Rjurik life. The local rulers are jarls, though druids hold the real power.</p><p>The Rjurik are suspicious of wizards and outland priests and may treat them roughly or subject them to crude pranks if given cause. Bards are called <i>skalds</i>, and are the keepers of history and lore. A bard can find a ready hearth in all but the meanest of Rlurik halls.</p><p>Most Rjurik follow the god Erik, a druidical ppwer, and druids are revered throughout Rjurik society as teachers, leaders, and advisers. All Rjurik have a deep respect and love for Cerilia's wilds, and carefully avoid over-hunting or clearing virgin forest.</p><p>A hpical Rjurik force has 20-25% elite warriors under the overall chieftain, 25-40% experienced warriors trained to fight in close order, 25-30% irregular warriors with light weapons, and up to 25% light archers. The war chief, war band leaders, and their immediate retinues have the best armor, usually chain mail, and the war axe is a favored weapon. There may be a scattering of berserkers, but no rangers or paladins.</p><p class=\"f\"><img src=\"/img/spc/humacer5.gif\" width=\"200\" height=\"240\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Vos\" title=\"Vos\" style=\"float:right;\"><b>Vos</b></p><p class=\"ni\">The Vos are a barbaric race from the cold mountains and forests of northeastern Cerilia. They are a tall, thick-boned people with flat features, light eyes, and sallow skin. Male warriors are fond of shaving their heads and wearing long, drooping mustaches. Their dress is rough, often quilted, and heavy furs are worn against the bitter cold.</p><p>The Vos have a rigid code of face and honor that demands blood for even unintentional insults. Their leaders are warchiefs known as <i>tsarevos</i> who are advised by the priests of the grim Vos gods. Almost all Vos men are warriors and hunters - other professions are considered unmanly. Vos women are by custom greatly limited in their freedoms, although a few women have succeeded as warriors or <i>tsarevas</i>.</p><p>Magic is the prerogative of the nobility - wizards are feared by the people. However, no noble would throw away a peasant skilled in magic who could be useful against his enemies.</p><p>Vas live in lands bitterly contested by orogs and similar humanoids, and harsh conditions have bred a harsh people Their rulers are visionary priests of dark and bloody gods who encourage continual warfare against each other and the enemies surrounding them. Though the Vos don't believe in mercy, they understand compassion - while they hunt their enemies ruthlessly, true friends are treasured.</p><p>A typical Vos field force has 25% lizard riders (exceptionally mobile in snow), 50% close order footmen, and the rest archers or irregular light infantry. Because paladins and rangers are nearly unheard of and wizards and priests are rare, Vos war leaders compensate by becoming masters of stratagem and treachery. Two key strengths of the Vos are the stoic capacity to function in spite of extreme privation - lack of food, shelter, warmth, and equipment - and an extraordinary discipline and march endurance. It is not unusual for a Vos armv to outmarch a conventional force of cavalry, and more than one encamped Vos army has slipped away in the night without alerting vigilant enemy scouts.</p><br clear=\"all\" style=\"clear:both; height:0;\">\r\n","images":["<img src=\"grf/br.gif\" width=\"150\" height=\"75\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Birthright\" title=\"Birthright\" align=\"right\">","<img src=\"/img/spc/humacer1.gif\" width=\"200\" height=\"240\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Anuirean\" title=\"Anuirean\" style=\"float:right;\">","<img src=\"/img/spc/humacer2.gif\" width=\"200\" height=\"240\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Brecht\" title=\"Brecht\" style=\"float:left;\">","<img src=\"/img/spc/humacer3.gif\" width=\"200\" height=\"240\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Khinasi\" title=\"Khinasi\" style=\"float:right;\">","<img src=\"/img/spc/humacer4.gif\" width=\"200\" height=\"240\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Rjurik\" title=\"Rjurik\" style=\"float:left;\">","<img src=\"/img/spc/humacer5.gif\" width=\"200\" height=\"240\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Vos\" title=\"Vos\" style=\"float:right;\">","<img src=\"grf/add2_01.gif\" width=\"200\" height=\"56\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Advanced Dungeons & Dragons 2nd Edition\">"],"setting":"Birthright","statblock":{"Anurien (Knight)":{"Alignment":"Any lawful","Armor Class":"2 or 4","Frequency":"Rare","Hit Dice":"2+","Morale":"Elite (14)","No. Appearing":"1-20","THAC0":"19 or less","Treasure":"L,M","XP Value":"Varies"},"Brecht (Tradesman)":{"Alignment":"Any","Armor Class":"8","Frequency":"Common","Hit Dice":"1-6 hp","Morale":"Steady (11)","No. Appearing":"2-12","THAC0":"20","Treasure":"1-100 gp","XP Value":"15"},"Khinasi (Soldier)":{"Alignment":"Any","Armor Class":"8 to 4","Frequency":"Common","Hit Dice":"1-6 hp","Morale":"Steady (10)","No. Appearing":"10-100","THAC0":"20","Treasure":"I","XP Value":"15"},"Rjurik (Berserker)":{"Alignment":"Neutral","Armor Class":"8 to 6","Frequency":"Uncommon","Hit Dice":"2-7 hp","Morale":"Fearless (20)","No. Appearing":"10-100","THAC0":"20","Treasure":"Nil","XP Value":"15"},"Vos (Mercenary)":{"Alignment":"Lawful neutral","Armor Class":"7 to 4","Frequency":"Common","Hit Dice":"2-8 hp","Morale":"Steady (12)","No. Appearing":"10-100","THAC0":"20","Treasure":"L,M","XP Value":"15"}},"title":"Human (Cerilia)"},"sources":["2166"],"statblock_names":[],"title":"Human (Cerilia)","prev_key":"humaatha","next_key":"humacurs","monster_path":"/appendix/humaceri"}},"staticQueryHashes":[],"slicesMap":{}}
