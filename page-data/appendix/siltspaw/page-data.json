While the powers listed above are the most common, some aarakocra have different or additional powers.</p><p class=\"f\">A race of intelligent, birdlike creatures living in the deepest deserts of Athas, the rare Athasian <a href=\"/appendix/aarakocr\">aarakocra</a> spends its time soaring on thermals in search of food.</p><p>The aarakocra is 7 to 8 feet tall with a wingspan of 20 feet or more. Because of its large wingspan, an aarakocra can carry as much as 75% of its own body weight and still fly easily. An aarakocra can fly a short distance carrying a burden equaling 125% of its own body weight. The average body weight of a full grown male is 100 pounds and a female is 85 pounds.</p><p>Each wing has a &ldquo;hand&rdquo; at its midpoint, consisting of three fingers and an opposable thumb. The fourth finger forms the rigid leading edge of the wing. In flight the hands cannot be used, but on the ground the aarakocra can use its hands almost as a human would. The aarakocra's body is protected by a thin bony plate on the chest, much like a solid rib cage. Talons on its legs can be used as claws and can be retracted to reveal a second set of hands, also with three fingers and an opposable thumb. Except for the chest plate, the entire skeleton is hollow and extremely fragile.</p><p>From a distance, the Athasian aarakocra resembles a huge <a href=\"/appendix/bird\">vulture</a>. Its black eyes, set in the front of the head, provide excellent vision over a long range. The plumage is generally black with a white collar for adult males and black or brown with a smaller white collar for females. Adolescents are a mixture of brown and black. The beak is large and covers most of the head. Plumage begins at the crown of the head and is darker near the head, except for the collar. Athasian aarakocra speak their own language and the languages of vultures and other large birds. Some speak the common tongue (5% to 10% chance depending on how deep in the wastelands a tribe lives).</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Combat:</b> Aarakocra can fight in the air or on the ground. They prefer aerial combat since their bones are too fragile to withstand a solid blow from a human-sized opponent. In combat against creatures on the ground, they prefer to fly over their victim and drop weighted nets. Some aarakocra use darts to harass ground-based opponents.</p><p>If their opponents can fly, the aarakocra generally forgo the use of the net, although large groups sometimes use nets on flying creatures. Normally, aarakocra attack flying creatures with long spears, diving from above and allowing the momentum to carry the spear through the target. Such an attack doubles the damage if the aarakocra have been able to dive at least 50 feet. Only the very largest aarakocra can carry more than one of these spears, they can attack with both at once with no penalty, causing double damage on each strike. All diving attacks are made at +4 and should be treated as a charge attack. All other penalties and restrictions of charge attacks apply.</p><p>The effect of the aarakocra's nets depends on if the opponent is flying at the time it becomes entangled. Creatures on the ground that are hit by a net are entangled and unable to participate in any combat until they make a successful Strength check to get free of the net. Flying creatures hit by a net can no longer fly and immediately begin falling. If they cannot escape the net or use some magical means to arrest the fall, normal falling damage applies.</p><p>Unless victims are entangled in nets, aarakocra are cautious in ground combat. If the aarakocra outnumber their opponents they advance in a straight line and thrust with their spears. If outnumbered, or the opponents are particularly tough, the aarakocra withdraw. Victims entangled in nets are killed or incapacitated for use as food or ransom.</p><p>Athasian aarakocra are mindful of their physical limitations as well as their comparatively low psionic abilities. They do not normally initiate psionic combat. At the first sign of psionic powers from any of their victims, however, all aarakocra that have some ability will use whatever attack and defense modes they can in an attempt to destroy the threat. Large groups of is or more aarakocra may initiate psionic combat if their leaders feel they can win quickly and avoid physical combat.</p><p>In desperation, an aarakocra can attempt to bite an opponent in combat. Because of the unwieldiness of its beak, the aarakocra has a THAC0 of 18 if attacking with this appendage. Further, the birdman causes only 1d2 points of damage with the beak.</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Habitat/Society:</b> Athasian aarakocra live in tribes with 6-20 (2d8+4) members, depending on the prestige of the leader. The largest tribe ever recorded had 50 members. The tribal hunting territory depends on the size of the tribe, usually about 500 square miles for a tribe of 10 members. There are no rigid boundaries between tribes and border disputes are not uncommon.</p><p>Alignments of tribe members are similar to the alignment of the leader. A tribe that has a leader who is neutral good may have neutral good, chaotic good, lawful good, and true neutral members. A predominantly evil tribe does not recognize boundaries with other tribes and treats other tribes as inferior beings to be eliminated.</p><p>Athasian aarakocra aren't happy in enclosed spaces, but they they take refuge in a cave or building if necessary.</p><p>Nonevil tribes live in rocky aeries in the highest peaks they can find. Evil tribes are normally nomadic and use an aerie made by another tribe if they need to remain in an area for a long time, even if they have to evict the tribe that made the nest.</p><p>Aarakocra aren't friendly toward intruders in their territory, especially caravans. They try to extract a toll from the caravan for passage through the desert. Good-aligned tribes allow unhindered passage of caravans that pay a tribute. If someone refuses to pay the tribute, the aarakocra try to capture scouts or outriders from the party and hold them until an even larger tribute is paid. The payment may be either livestock or shiny objects. Aarakocra are smart enough not to be taken in by glass baubles instead of gems, although they cannot tell the difference between the more common gems and the rare ones.</p><p>Evil tribes ask for tribute and often attack a caravan whether it pays or not. Aarakocra always demand shiny objects such as stones. These tribes find humans and demihumans to be quite tasty and prefer them to other food.</p><p>Good-aligned tribes of aarakocra sometimes return a lost traveler to the edge of the desert after first removing any valuables the traveler may be carrying. On very rare occasions a tribe might return a lost group of travelers to the more frequently traveled parts of the desert, again after first taking any valuables as payment.</p><p>The oldest male is the leader of the tribal hunting party and has 4+4 Hit Dice. The oldest female is in charge of the tribal aerie and has 3+3 HD. In tribes that have more than 15 members, the next oldest aarakocra serves as shaman and has 3+3 HD; the shaman completes the triumvirate necessary for proper worship and the summoning of elementals. (Interestingly, no magic-using aarakocra has ever been recorded.) Tribes without a shaman cannot summon <a href=\"/appendix/element1\">air elementals</a>, which is an important part of aarakocra culture.</p><p>The shaman is the leader of the daily sun worship. Aarakocra worship the sun because it provides them with the thermals they need to soar in search of food. The shaman also leads the mystic rituals used to summon an air elemental. Summoning an air elemental is usually done only in preparation for the tribe's most sacred ceremony, the hunt. Small tribes must band together for this ceremony to allow the triumvirate to be formed.</p><p>The ceremony to summon an air elemental must be conducted at dawn and requires the oldest male and female to emit a highpitched keening whistle. The shaman conducts an intricate dance around them, simultaneously chanting an ancient summoning mantra.</p><p>The hunt is the final part of the initiation of adolescent aarakocra to adulthood and often takes the tribe far from their normal teritory. The target is always a <a href=\"/appendix/drakalsi\">silt drake</a>. The hunt is the only time the females leave the relative safety of the nest. Even an evil tribe will not interfere with a tribe on a hunt. An air elemental is often summoned to help find the drake, but never takes part in the actual combat. Although the adult members of the tribe take part in the initial phases of the combat, it is the initiates who deliver the final, killing blows to me drake. Scars from the hunt are considered a mark of pride among all aarakocra.</p><p>The females spend about eight months of the year incubating their eggs. Athasian aarakocra mate for life and a pair normally produces as many as 10 offspring. A female lays one egg a year. Constant incubation is not required because of the high daytime temperatures, so the females can maintain the nest and keep the tribe's treasure in order.</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Ecology:</b> Athasian aarakocra are high on the food chain and have no natural enemies other than <a href=\"/appendix/drakatha\">drakes</a>. Unless evil, aarakocra leave their own territory only to hunt the silt drake and return as soon as possible when the hunt is over. (Evil aarakocra attack others, as noted above.) Aarakocra eggs and hatchlings are sought after by wealthy land owners who wish to use the creatures as scouts and sentries. An egg can bring as much as 10 cp in Tyr's marketplace. Tribes that have had eggs or hatchlings stolen have long memories and sometimes take revenge against the thief at a later date. Captive aarakocra join any tribe they come in contact with.</p><p>Athasian aarakocra have a natural life span of 21-30 years.</p><br clear=\"all\" style=\"clear:both; height:0;\">\r\n","images":["<img src=\"grf/ds.gif\" width=\"150\" height=\"75\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Dark Sun\" title=\"Dark Sun\" align=\"right\">","<img src=\"img/aarakath.gif\" alt=\"Aarakocra (Athas)\" title=\"Aarakocra (Athas)\" border=\"0\" width=\"300\" height=\"360\" style=\"text-align:right;\" align=\"right\">","<img src=\"grf/add2_01.gif\" width=\"200\" height=\"56\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Advanced Dungeons & Dragons 2nd Edition\">"],"setting":"Dark Sun","statblock":{"Aarakocra (Athas)":{"Activity Cycle":"Day","Alignment":"Any","Armor Class":"7","Climate/Terrain":"Deep desert","Damage/Attack":"1d3/1d3 or by weapon","Diet":"Carnivore","Frequency":"Rare","Hit Dice":"2+2","Intelligence":"Average (8-10)","Magic Resistance":"Nil","Morale":"Steady (11)","Movement":"6, Fl 36 (C)","No. Appearing":"1d10","No. of Attacks":"2","Organization":"Tribal","Size":"M (20'+ wingspan)","Special Attacks":"Nil","Special Defenses":"Nil","THAC0":"17","Treasure":"Varies","XP Value":"65"}},"title":"Aarakocra (Athas)"},"sources":["2433"],"statblock_names":[],"title":"Aarakocra (Athas)","prev_key":"zygraat","next_key":"aarakocr","monster_path":"/appendix/aarakath"}}},"pageContext":{"monster_key":"siltspaw","monster_data":{"TSR":["2432","2433"],"fullBody":"  <table cellspacing=\"0\" cellpadding=\"0\"><tr><th>Climate/Terrain:</th><td>Sea of Silt</td></tr><tr><th>Frequency:</th><td>Uncommon</td></tr><tr><th>Organization:</th><td>Clutch</td></tr><tr><th>Activity Cycle:</th><td>Day</td></tr><tr><th>Diet:</th><td>Carnivore</td></tr><tr><th>Intelligence:</th><td>Animal (1)</td></tr><tr><th>Treasure:</th><td>Nil</td></tr><tr><th>Alignment:</th><td>Neutral</td></tr><tr><th>No. Appearing:</th><td>2d6</td></tr><tr><th>Armor Class:</th><td>8</td></tr><tr><th>Movement:</th><td>15 (in silt)</td></tr><tr><th>Hit Dice:</th><td>2</td></tr><tr><th>THAC0:</th><td>19</td></tr><tr><th>No. of Attacks:</th><td>1</td></tr><tr><th>Damage/Attack:</th><td>1d8</td></tr><tr><th>Special Attacks:</th><td>Nil</td></tr><tr><th>Special Defenses:</th><td>Nil</td></tr><tr><th>Magic Resistance:</th><td>Nil</td></tr><tr><th>Size:</th><td>M (4' long)</td></tr><tr><th>Morale:</th><td>Steady (12)</td></tr><tr><th>XP Value:</th><td>65</td></tr></table><p class=\"f\">Silt spawn are the young of the <a href=\"/appendix/silthorr\">silt horrors</a> that roam the Sea of Silt. Unlike their adult counterparts, coloration is more difficult to detect at this young age. It seems that the young are born with random colors and only take on the appearance of silt horrors as they reach maturity. Silt spawn only remotely resemble the adult creatures they will become, and few who see them would even guess at a connection between the smaller silt spawn and the huge, multi-tentacled silt horrors they grow into.</p><p>Silt spawn have tentacles and teeth, like the adult horrors, but they appear flatter, less bulbous. They keep this flat shape until reaching a size of about 10 feet long, then they start to take on the characteristics that differentiate them as adult silt horrors.</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Combat:</b> When aroused, a clutch of young horrors will gauge their prey's strength before attacking as a group. The only attack form available to the silt spawn is a bite, as its tentacles have not yet developed enough strength to be used offensively. The silt spawn usually concentrate on a single target, hoping to drag it under the silt where the entire clutch can share in the feast.</p><p>Though the silt spawn are small, their varied nature and youthful energy makes them deadly in their own right. Because of their ability to move quietly through the silt, opponents receive a -2 penalty to all surprise rolls. If a victim is surprised, in the first round of combat all of the silt spawn get to make a free attack against the target.</p><p>One tactic that the spawn have learned is to drag prey deeper into the silt. If more than two of the spawn manage to bite a character in the same round, the victim must make a successful Strength check or be dragged a number of feet into the silt equal to the number of silt spawn that bit him. A character who failed a Strength check and was bitten by three spawn would be dragged three feet deeper into the silt. If the victim is standing on a shoal ledge or reef, this can often lead to a quick and dusty death - as well as provide a hearty meal for a clutch of silt spawn.</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Habitat/Society:</b> Silt spawn live in ruins or rocky sanctuaries beneath the silt where larger creatures usually can't get at them. When they sense prey nearby, they quietly move toward the surface and wait to ambush them.</p><p>While adult silt horrors are solitary creatures, silt spawn live in clutches of 2-12 creatures. They have the same constant hunger that drives the silt horrors, but silt spawn will actually work together to capture prey. Many of the techniques they learn to use in the clutch will serve them just as well when they reach adulthood. Once they are full grown, silt horrors use their many tentacles to grab and drag prey instead of relying on the help of clutchmates.</p><p>Unlike adult silt horrors, silt spawn are tasty and can be used as a source of food. While giants will avoid silt horrors unless desperately hungry, they will seek out silt spawn as a delicacy. For this reason, and because of their smaller size, silt spawn tend to be much faster than their adult counterparts. Their sleek design gives them the ability to &ldquo;fly&rdquo; through silt. They do this by employing powerful body muscles and their shorter tentacles to produce movement - much like <a href=\"/appendix/eel\">eels</a> swim through water.</p><p>A silt horror always lingers near silt-covered ruins and buried reefs as it prepares to give birth. After an adult horror gives birth to a clutch of silt spawn, the spawn take refuge in the ruins or reefs to avoid the gnawing hunger of their parent. A silt horror has no love for its spawn, and will try to eat its young with as much enthusiasm as it shows other living things. Once the spawn have escaped the horror's tentacles (and not all do), the horror responds to the call of the deeper silt and moves away from the birthing ground. The spawn remain in the protected area until they reach a size that will make them less likely targets of the adult horrors.</p><p>A clutch of silt spawn is usually, but not always, made up of the offspring of a single horror. Sometimes two or more horrors will give birth in the same area at approximately the same time. In this rare instance, all of the spawn will seek each other out and form a massive clutch. They lose this companionship when they reach adulthood, as silt spawn grow increasingly independent as they mature into silt horrors.</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Ecology:</b> Silt spawn live in clutches until they are too big to fit in the shallow silt. Then they move out into the depths of the Silt Sea to become true silt horrors. Though different colored horrors have been known to prey on each other, silt priests claim that those that are raised in the same clutch - even if they are of different species - will not. Perhaps this is due to some scent or other natural phenomenon native to their breeding beds.</p><p>Silt spawn are sometimes hunted not only as food, but because their outer layer of skin can be used to make waterproof sacks. The giants of the Silt Sea islands make water containers and storage sacks out of the silt spawn they capture - after hollowing them out and removing all of the tasty meat first.</p><p>A weed called draxia that grows on the islands of the Sea of Silt can be turned into an ointment that repels silt spawn and irritates silt horrors. When the plant's juice is rubbed on the skin, it acts as a repellent to drive away silt spawn. The smell lasts for two hours, during which time silt spawn will not come within 10 feet of a person or creature coated with the stuff. While silt horrors don't like the smell, they can ignore it and attack as usual in its presence. In fact, many times the irritation caused by the plant's juice will simply serve to infuriate a silt horror. There is a 60% chance that a silt horror will ignore all other targets to attack a character that smells of draxia weed.</p><br clear=\"all\" style=\"clear:both; height:0;\">\r\n","images":["<img src=\"grf/ds.gif\" width=\"150\" height=\"75\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Dark Sun\" title=\"Dark Sun\" align=\"right\">","<img src=\"img/siltspaw.gif\" alt=\"Silt Spawn\" title=\"Silt Spawn\" border=\"0\" width=\"300\" height=\"360\" style=\"text-align:right;\" align=\"right\">","<img src=\"grf/add2_01.gif\" width=\"200\" height=\"56\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Advanced Dungeons & Dragons 2nd Edition\">"],"setting":"Dark Sun","statblock":{"Silt Spawn":{"Activity Cycle":"Day","Alignment":"Neutral","Armor Class":"8","Climate/Terrain":"Sea of Silt","Damage/Attack":"1d8","Diet":"Carnivore","Frequency":"Uncommon","Hit Dice":"2","Intelligence":"Animal (1)","Magic Resistance":"Nil","Morale":"Steady (12)","Movement":"15 (in silt)","No. Appearing":"2d6","No. of Attacks":"1","Organization":"Clutch","Size":"M (4' long)","Special Attacks":"Nil","Special Defenses":"Nil","THAC0":"19","Treasure":"Nil","XP Value":"65"}},"title":"Silt Spawn"},"sources":["2432","2433"],"statblock_names":[],"title":"Silt Spawn","prev_key":"siltserp","next_key":"silvedog","monster_path":"/appendix/siltspaw"}},"staticQueryHashes":[],"slicesMap":{}}
