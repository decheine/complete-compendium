While the powers listed above are the most common, some aarakocra have different or additional powers.</p><p class=\"f\">A race of intelligent, birdlike creatures living in the deepest deserts of Athas, the rare Athasian <a href=\"/appendix/aarakocr\">aarakocra</a> spends its time soaring on thermals in search of food.</p><p>The aarakocra is 7 to 8 feet tall with a wingspan of 20 feet or more. Because of its large wingspan, an aarakocra can carry as much as 75% of its own body weight and still fly easily. An aarakocra can fly a short distance carrying a burden equaling 125% of its own body weight. The average body weight of a full grown male is 100 pounds and a female is 85 pounds.</p><p>Each wing has a &ldquo;hand&rdquo; at its midpoint, consisting of three fingers and an opposable thumb. The fourth finger forms the rigid leading edge of the wing. In flight the hands cannot be used, but on the ground the aarakocra can use its hands almost as a human would. The aarakocra's body is protected by a thin bony plate on the chest, much like a solid rib cage. Talons on its legs can be used as claws and can be retracted to reveal a second set of hands, also with three fingers and an opposable thumb. Except for the chest plate, the entire skeleton is hollow and extremely fragile.</p><p>From a distance, the Athasian aarakocra resembles a huge <a href=\"/appendix/bird\">vulture</a>. Its black eyes, set in the front of the head, provide excellent vision over a long range. The plumage is generally black with a white collar for adult males and black or brown with a smaller white collar for females. Adolescents are a mixture of brown and black. The beak is large and covers most of the head. Plumage begins at the crown of the head and is darker near the head, except for the collar. Athasian aarakocra speak their own language and the languages of vultures and other large birds. Some speak the common tongue (5% to 10% chance depending on how deep in the wastelands a tribe lives).</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Combat:</b> Aarakocra can fight in the air or on the ground. They prefer aerial combat since their bones are too fragile to withstand a solid blow from a human-sized opponent. In combat against creatures on the ground, they prefer to fly over their victim and drop weighted nets. Some aarakocra use darts to harass ground-based opponents.</p><p>If their opponents can fly, the aarakocra generally forgo the use of the net, although large groups sometimes use nets on flying creatures. Normally, aarakocra attack flying creatures with long spears, diving from above and allowing the momentum to carry the spear through the target. Such an attack doubles the damage if the aarakocra have been able to dive at least 50 feet. Only the very largest aarakocra can carry more than one of these spears, they can attack with both at once with no penalty, causing double damage on each strike. All diving attacks are made at +4 and should be treated as a charge attack. All other penalties and restrictions of charge attacks apply.</p><p>The effect of the aarakocra's nets depends on if the opponent is flying at the time it becomes entangled. Creatures on the ground that are hit by a net are entangled and unable to participate in any combat until they make a successful Strength check to get free of the net. Flying creatures hit by a net can no longer fly and immediately begin falling. If they cannot escape the net or use some magical means to arrest the fall, normal falling damage applies.</p><p>Unless victims are entangled in nets, aarakocra are cautious in ground combat. If the aarakocra outnumber their opponents they advance in a straight line and thrust with their spears. If outnumbered, or the opponents are particularly tough, the aarakocra withdraw. Victims entangled in nets are killed or incapacitated for use as food or ransom.</p><p>Athasian aarakocra are mindful of their physical limitations as well as their comparatively low psionic abilities. They do not normally initiate psionic combat. At the first sign of psionic powers from any of their victims, however, all aarakocra that have some ability will use whatever attack and defense modes they can in an attempt to destroy the threat. Large groups of is or more aarakocra may initiate psionic combat if their leaders feel they can win quickly and avoid physical combat.</p><p>In desperation, an aarakocra can attempt to bite an opponent in combat. Because of the unwieldiness of its beak, the aarakocra has a THAC0 of 18 if attacking with this appendage. Further, the birdman causes only 1d2 points of damage with the beak.</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Habitat/Society:</b> Athasian aarakocra live in tribes with 6-20 (2d8+4) members, depending on the prestige of the leader. The largest tribe ever recorded had 50 members. The tribal hunting territory depends on the size of the tribe, usually about 500 square miles for a tribe of 10 members. There are no rigid boundaries between tribes and border disputes are not uncommon.</p><p>Alignments of tribe members are similar to the alignment of the leader. A tribe that has a leader who is neutral good may have neutral good, chaotic good, lawful good, and true neutral members. A predominantly evil tribe does not recognize boundaries with other tribes and treats other tribes as inferior beings to be eliminated.</p><p>Athasian aarakocra aren't happy in enclosed spaces, but they they take refuge in a cave or building if necessary.</p><p>Nonevil tribes live in rocky aeries in the highest peaks they can find. Evil tribes are normally nomadic and use an aerie made by another tribe if they need to remain in an area for a long time, even if they have to evict the tribe that made the nest.</p><p>Aarakocra aren't friendly toward intruders in their territory, especially caravans. They try to extract a toll from the caravan for passage through the desert. Good-aligned tribes allow unhindered passage of caravans that pay a tribute. If someone refuses to pay the tribute, the aarakocra try to capture scouts or outriders from the party and hold them until an even larger tribute is paid. The payment may be either livestock or shiny objects. Aarakocra are smart enough not to be taken in by glass baubles instead of gems, although they cannot tell the difference between the more common gems and the rare ones.</p><p>Evil tribes ask for tribute and often attack a caravan whether it pays or not. Aarakocra always demand shiny objects such as stones. These tribes find humans and demihumans to be quite tasty and prefer them to other food.</p><p>Good-aligned tribes of aarakocra sometimes return a lost traveler to the edge of the desert after first removing any valuables the traveler may be carrying. On very rare occasions a tribe might return a lost group of travelers to the more frequently traveled parts of the desert, again after first taking any valuables as payment.</p><p>The oldest male is the leader of the tribal hunting party and has 4+4 Hit Dice. The oldest female is in charge of the tribal aerie and has 3+3 HD. In tribes that have more than 15 members, the next oldest aarakocra serves as shaman and has 3+3 HD; the shaman completes the triumvirate necessary for proper worship and the summoning of elementals. (Interestingly, no magic-using aarakocra has ever been recorded.) Tribes without a shaman cannot summon <a href=\"/appendix/element1\">air elementals</a>, which is an important part of aarakocra culture.</p><p>The shaman is the leader of the daily sun worship. Aarakocra worship the sun because it provides them with the thermals they need to soar in search of food. The shaman also leads the mystic rituals used to summon an air elemental. Summoning an air elemental is usually done only in preparation for the tribe's most sacred ceremony, the hunt. Small tribes must band together for this ceremony to allow the triumvirate to be formed.</p><p>The ceremony to summon an air elemental must be conducted at dawn and requires the oldest male and female to emit a highpitched keening whistle. The shaman conducts an intricate dance around them, simultaneously chanting an ancient summoning mantra.</p><p>The hunt is the final part of the initiation of adolescent aarakocra to adulthood and often takes the tribe far from their normal teritory. The target is always a <a href=\"/appendix/drakalsi\">silt drake</a>. The hunt is the only time the females leave the relative safety of the nest. Even an evil tribe will not interfere with a tribe on a hunt. An air elemental is often summoned to help find the drake, but never takes part in the actual combat. Although the adult members of the tribe take part in the initial phases of the combat, it is the initiates who deliver the final, killing blows to me drake. Scars from the hunt are considered a mark of pride among all aarakocra.</p><p>The females spend about eight months of the year incubating their eggs. Athasian aarakocra mate for life and a pair normally produces as many as 10 offspring. A female lays one egg a year. Constant incubation is not required because of the high daytime temperatures, so the females can maintain the nest and keep the tribe's treasure in order.</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Ecology:</b> Athasian aarakocra are high on the food chain and have no natural enemies other than <a href=\"/appendix/drakatha\">drakes</a>. Unless evil, aarakocra leave their own territory only to hunt the silt drake and return as soon as possible when the hunt is over. (Evil aarakocra attack others, as noted above.) Aarakocra eggs and hatchlings are sought after by wealthy land owners who wish to use the creatures as scouts and sentries. An egg can bring as much as 10 cp in Tyr's marketplace. Tribes that have had eggs or hatchlings stolen have long memories and sometimes take revenge against the thief at a later date. Captive aarakocra join any tribe they come in contact with.</p><p>Athasian aarakocra have a natural life span of 21-30 years.</p><p></p><br clear=\"all\" style=\"clear:both; height:0;\">\r\n","images":["<img src=\"grf/ds.gif\" width=\"150\" height=\"75\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Dark Sun\" title=\"Dark Sun\" align=\"right\">","<img src=\"img/aarakath.gif\" alt=\"Aarakocra (Athas)\" title=\"Aarakocra (Athas)\" border=\"0\" width=\"300\" height=\"360\" style=\"text-align:right;\" align=\"right\">","<img src=\"grf/add2_01.gif\" width=\"200\" height=\"56\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Advanced Dungeons & Dragons 2nd Edition\">"],"setting":"Dark Sun","statblock":{"Aarakocra (Athas)":{"Activity Cycle":"Day","Alignment":"Any","Armor Class":"7","Climate/Terrain":"Deep desert","Damage/Attack":"1d3/1d3 or by weapon","Diet":"Carnivore","Frequency":"Rare","Hit Dice":"2+2","Intelligence":"Average (8-10)","Magic Resistance":"Nil","Morale":"Steady (11)","Movement":"6, Fl 36 (C)","No. Appearing":"1d10","No. of Attacks":"2","Organization":"Tribal","Size":"M (20'+ wingspan)","Special Attacks":"Nil","Special Defenses":"Nil","THAC0":"17","Treasure":"Varies","XP Value":"65"}},"title":"Aarakocra (Athas)"},"sources":["2433"],"statblock_names":[],"title":"Aarakocra (Athas)","prev_key":"zygraat","next_key":"aarakocr","monster_path":"/appendix/aarakath"}}},"pageContext":{"monster_key":"fishdeoc","monster_data":{"TSR":["2173","Dragon235"],"fullBody":"  <table cellspacing=\"0\" cellpadding=\"0\"><tr class=\"bk\"><th> </th><th class=\"cn\">Angler Fish</th><th class=\"cn\">Death Minnow</th><th class=\"cn\">Gulper</th><th class=\"cn\">Viperfish</th></tr><tr><th>Climate/Terrain:</th><td>Ocean depths</td><td>Ocean depths</td><td>Ocean depths</td><td>Ocean depths</td></tr><tr><th>Frequency:</th><td>Uncommon</td><td>Very rare</td><td>Uncommon</td><td>Uncommon</td></tr><tr><th>Organization:</th><td>Solitary</td><td>Solitary</td><td>Solitary</td><td>Solitary</td></tr><tr><th>Activity Cycle:</th><td>Any</td><td>Any</td><td>Any</td><td>Any</td></tr><tr><th>Diet:</th><td>Carnivore</td><td>Carnivore</td><td>Carnivore</td><td>Carnivore</td></tr><tr><th>Intelligence:</th><td>Animal (1)</td><td>Animal (1)</td><td>Animal (1)</td><td>Animal (1)</td></tr><tr><th>Treasure:</th><td>Nil</td><td>Nil</td><td>Nil</td><td>Nil</td></tr><tr><th>Alignment:</th><td>Neutral</td><td>Neutral</td><td>Neutral</td><td>Neutral</td></tr><tr><th>No. Appearing:</th><td>1</td><td>1-2</td><td>1</td><td>1-2</td></tr><tr><th>Armor Class:</th><td>8</td><td>10</td><td>9</td><td>7</td></tr><tr><th>Movement:</th><td>Sw 12</td><td>Sw 9 (12)</td><td>Sw 15</td><td>Sw 18</td></tr><tr><th>Hit Dice:</th><td>8</td><td>6</td><td>9</td><td>10</td></tr><tr><th>THAC0:</th><td>13</td><td>15</td><td>11</td><td>11</td></tr><tr><th>No. of Attacks:</th><td>1</td><td>1</td><td>1</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><th>Damage/Attack:</th><td>2d8 (some species 1d4)</td><td>Special</td><td>2d8 (some species 1d8)</td><td>1d20</td></tr><tr><th>Special Attacks:</th><td>Swallows whole</td><td>Swallows whole, <i>enlarge</i></td><td>Constriction, swallows whole</td><td>Swallow whole (some: constriction)</td></tr><tr><th>Special Defenses:</th><td>Nil</td><td><i>Shrink</i></td><td>Nil</td><td>Nil</td></tr><tr><th>Magic Resistance:</th><td>Nil</td><td>Nil</td><td>Nil</td><td>Nil</td></tr><tr><th>Size:</th><td>L (8' long)</td><td>T or L (2&rdquo; or 8')</td><td>L (12' long)</td><td>H (20' long)</td></tr><tr><th>Morale:</th><td>Elite (13)</td><td>Elite (13)</td><td>Elite (13)</td><td>Fearless (20)</td></tr><tr><th>XP Value:</th><td>1,400</td><td>2,000</td><td>3,000</td><td>5,000</td></tr></table><p class=\"f\"><b><img src=\"/img/spc/fishdeo1.gif\" width=\"300\" height=\"360\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Angler Fish\" title=\"Angler Fish\" style=\"float:right;\">Angler Fish</b></p>  <p class=\"ni\">The <a href=\"/appendix/anglfish\">angler fish</a> is, as its name implies, a <a href=\"/appendix/fish\">fish</a> that hunts the lightless depths by means of a natural &ldquo;fishing line&rdquo;, sometimes even with a hook (not in the real-world creatures). These bloated looking things are clumsy swimmers, relying on their lures to cause prey to come to them. Surface-dwellers have an illicium (the &ldquo;fishing line&rdquo;, actually the modified first ray of the dorsal fin) that looks like a worm or similar creature; with deep-sea anglers, the illicium is luminous. Some anglers don't have an illicium, relying instead on a luminous growth protruding from the roof or palate of the mouth. These growths, in some fantastic species, might resemble anything from mounds of sunken treasure to a beautiful mermaid, both lying in a &ldquo;cavern&rdquo; chock full of &ldquo;stalactites&rdquo; and &ldquo;stalagmites&rdquo;. Most anglers are no bigger than a man's fist, though one surface-dwelling type is large enough to swallow ducks and geese and does so.</p><p>Combat for the angler fish generally consists of decoying the victim close enough to be attacked, with the teeth getting in one good bite (2d8 damage) and then simply holding the victim in place to be digested (1d8 damage per round). Some anglers actually have one or more hooks at the end of the illicium. With some fantastic species of these fish, these hooks are functional and can be used to snare prey (1d4 points of damage), drawing it down to the mouth to be bitten automatically in the same round. The angler fish's poor Armour Class allows stabbing weapons to penetrate it relatively easily. A swallowed prey takes as much damage from the attack as the fish. The fish's teeth curve inward, so it can't even think about letting go, no matter how much opponents with tridents and daggers might make it wish it could. Swallowing prey is the ultimate act of commitment.</p><p>In most species of angler fish, only the females do the hunting. The male, only a fraction of the female's size, clings like a <a href=\"/appendix/lamprey\">lamprey</a> to her body, living off her as a parasite. This works well for the angler fish; despite the darkness of the ocean depths and the fact that angler fish are few and far between, this system ensures that every fish always has a mate on hand when breeding season comes around. What happens to the young is not known.</p><p>The angler fish is a typical predator, like nearly all hunters of the deep. Its flesh is edible, though not a gourmet's delight by human standards.</p><p></p><p class=\"f\"><b><img src=\"/img/spc/fishdeo2.gif\" width=\"300\" height=\"360\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Death Minnow\" title=\"Death Minnow\" style=\"float:left;\">Death Minnow</b></p>  <p class=\"ni\">The <a href=\"/appendix/deatminn\">death minnow</a> is a bright orange fish only 2 inches long. It is a magical creature, created by powerful, but unknown, undersea sorcerers (<a href=\"/appendix/aboleth\">aboleths</a>? <a href=\"/appendix/sahuagin\">sahuagin</a>?) A potent guardian of dark undersea lairs and treasure troves, this creature relies on pressure-sensitive lateral lines to detect its prey.</p><p>The death minnow's creators incorporated into the fish an innate magical ability similar to the reversible spell <i>enlarge/reduce</i>. Simply put, this little fish can swim up to a creature, looking as innocuous as can be, suddenly enlarge itself to the size of a giant angler fish, swallow the surprised victim with a single gulp, and then reduce both itself and the victim to minute size again. If no one else is loking in the victim's direction at the time (remember, there is apparently nothing large enough to be a threat in the vicinity), then the target will seem to have simply disappeared without a trace.</p><p>The act of swallowing itself causes no damage, as the victim is drawn into the fish's mouth by suction. Once inside, however, the prey suffers 1d6 points of damage from the death minnow's digestive juices until rescue or death. Weapons inflict full damage on the swallowed creature as well as the death minnow. However, even bloated with prey, the tiny death minnow can easily dodge most blows. Once the fish is slain (an ingrained instinct prevents it from releasing its prey under any circumstances), the victim instantly returns to normal size. Casting <i>dispel magic</i> on a tiny death minnow causes it to grow to its monster size of 8 feet, making it a far easier target.</p><p>There are no known &ldquo;wild&rdquo; populations of death minnows. These are magical guard beasts. As they are created magically, they do not need to breed. In fact, it is uncertain if they even have male and female sexes.</p><p>As a magical guardian beast, the death minnow ensures that the immediate vicinity it is set to guard remains free of such dangerous predators as adventurers. If the party can kill one, its blood might be used as an ingredient in the ink used for penning <i>enlarge</i> or <i>shrink</i> on spell scrolls. If, instead, someone wants to return the swallowing favor by eating it, it tastes remarkably like kippered herring.</p><p></p><p class=\"f\"><b><img src=\"/img/spc/fishdeo3.gif\" width=\"300\" height=\"360\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Gulper\" title=\"Gulper\" style=\"float:right;\">Gulper</b></p>  <p class=\"ni\">The <a href=\"/appendix/gulper\">gulper</a> is little more than a huge mouth, followed by a trailing tail that seems to stretch on forever. The mouth is huge; it can swallow prey several times larger than the gulper itself. Gulpers ean grow to a length of 12 feet. This creature has small eyes set on top of its head to catch the least bit of sunlight that filters down from the surface; however, it relies almost solely on its lateral lines (a pressure-sensitive line that runs along each side of its body) to feel the approach of prey. Some species have a bioelectric light at the tip of the tail, to attract potential victims. The giant eel, <a href=\"/appendix/fishvurg\">vurgens</a>, found in the Forgotten Realms setting, is a giant species of gulper that hunts in shallower water.</p><p>The gulper's bite, causing 2d8 points of damage, is inflicted only once on any prey. The next round, the victim is swallowed whole, and the creature's teeth are now reduced to a supportive role, holding the prey in place so it can't get away. Further damage is caused by the gulper's digestive juices, which inflict 1d8 points of damage per turn until the prey is either digested or released. Release can be tricky, though, as cutting though the gulper's soft flesh inflicts an equal amount of damage on the trapped prey.</p><p>A gulper might use its tail for a constriction attack, inflicting 1d6 points of damage per round upon the hapless victim. Any creature smaller than size G can be constricted by a 12-foot gulper.</p><p>Gulpers are solitary. Their reproductive cycle is unknown, but it is possible that one parent may shelter the newborn young in its mouth for a time. In this case, &ldquo;survival of the fittest&rdquo; means knowing enough to leave home before hunger overrides parental urges.</p><p>Gulpers eat anything. They are edible in tum, with delicate flesh. An enterprising magical artificer might use their skin in the construction of - what else - a <i>bag of holding</i>.</p><p></p><p class=\"f\"><b><img src=\"/img/spc/fishdeo4.gif\" width=\"300\" height=\"360\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Viperfish\" title=\"Viperfish\" style=\"float:left;\">Viperfish</b></p>  <p class=\"ni\">The viperfish is among the most vicious inhabitants of the deepest ocean depths. It is an active cruiser after prey rather than a mere passive toothed trap waiting for a meal to come within reach. The creature has lights for vision as well as for attracting prey, and often has a double row of lights along its torso like portholes on an ocean liner. Prey lures include luminous patches directly inside the creature's mouth. From a viperfish's chin protrudes one or more branches - or whiplike growths. In all species, this is an extension of the lateral line senses, serving as a type of antenna to detect movement in the water. Some fantastic species, however, might also use it as a weapon (see below). The smallest natural viperfish is about an inch and a half long, while the largest can grow to 6 feet. Monstrous viperfish might grow to a length of 20 feet or more.</p><p>Like many other fish of the depths, a viperfish gets in one good bite at the start of the attack (1d20 points of damage) and then swallows its prey whole, its teeth serving as no more than bars in a cage to keep the prey from escaping. They also keep the viperfish from letting its prey go if it realizes it is too much for it, as they slantbackwards. If the viperfish takes too big a mouthful, then that's just too bad for it, as well as for its prey. Some specimens have a whiplike chin growth that acts as a tentacle causing 1d8 points of constriction damage. Swallowed prey takes 1d8 points of damage per round from the viperfish's stomach acids until rescued or dead. Slashing or piercing damage inflicted on the viperfish is inflicted on the trapped prey as well.</p><p>Viperfish are solitary creatures, only coming together briefly for the mating season. They abandon their young as soon as the eggs are laid.</p><p>As active hunters, viperfish have more of an impact on the deep-sea ecology than those predators that simply sit around waiting for prey to come to them. They also have edible, if nontasty, flesh</p><p></p><br clear=\"all\" style=\"clear:both; height:0;\">\r\n","images":["<img src=\"grf/dr.gif\" width=\"150\" height=\"75\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Dragon Magazine\" title=\"Dragon Magazine\" align=\"right\">","<img src=\"/img/spc/fishdeo1.gif\" width=\"300\" height=\"360\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Angler Fish\" title=\"Angler Fish\" style=\"float:right;\">","<img src=\"/img/spc/fishdeo2.gif\" width=\"300\" height=\"360\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Death Minnow\" title=\"Death Minnow\" style=\"float:left;\">","<img src=\"/img/spc/fishdeo3.gif\" width=\"300\" height=\"360\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Gulper\" title=\"Gulper\" style=\"float:right;\">","<img src=\"/img/spc/fishdeo4.gif\" width=\"300\" height=\"360\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Viperfish\" title=\"Viperfish\" style=\"float:left;\">","<img src=\"grf/add2_01.gif\" width=\"200\" height=\"56\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Advanced Dungeons & Dragons 2nd Edition\">"],"setting":"Dragon Magazine","statblock":{"Angler Fish":{"Activity Cycle":"Any","Alignment":"Neutral","Armor Class":"8","Climate/Terrain":"Ocean depths","Damage/Attack":"2d8 (some species 1d4)","Diet":"Carnivore","Frequency":"Uncommon","Hit Dice":"8","Intelligence":"Animal (1)","Magic Resistance":"Nil","Morale":"Elite (13)","Movement":"Sw 12","No. Appearing":"1","No. of Attacks":"1","Organization":"Solitary","Size":"L (8' long)","Special Attacks":"Swallows whole","Special Defenses":"Nil","THAC0":"13","Treasure":"Nil","XP Value":"1,400"},"Death Minnow":{"Activity Cycle":"Any","Alignment":"Neutral","Armor Class":"10","Climate/Terrain":"Ocean depths","Damage/Attack":"Special","Diet":"Carnivore","Frequency":"Very rare","Hit Dice":"6","Intelligence":"Animal (1)","Magic Resistance":"Nil","Morale":"Elite (13)","Movement":"Sw 9 (12)","No. Appearing":"1-2","No. of Attacks":"1","Organization":"Solitary","Size":"T or L (2&rdquo; or 8')","Special Attacks":"Swallows whole, <i>enlarge</i>","Special Defenses":"<i>Shrink</i>","THAC0":"15","Treasure":"Nil","XP Value":"2,000"},"Gulper":{"Activity Cycle":"Any","Alignment":"Neutral","Armor Class":"9","Climate/Terrain":"Ocean depths","Damage/Attack":"2d8 (some species 1d8)","Diet":"Carnivore","Frequency":"Uncommon","Hit Dice":"9","Intelligence":"Animal (1)","Magic Resistance":"Nil","Morale":"Elite (13)","Movement":"Sw 15","No. Appearing":"1","No. of Attacks":"1","Organization":"Solitary","Size":"L (12' long)","Special Attacks":"Constriction, swallows whole","Special Defenses":"Nil","THAC0":"11","Treasure":"Nil","XP Value":"3,000"},"Viperfish":{"Activity Cycle":"Any","Alignment":"Neutral","Armor Class":"7","Climate/Terrain":"Ocean depths","Damage/Attack":"1d20","Diet":"Carnivore","Frequency":"Uncommon","Hit Dice":"10","Intelligence":"Animal (1)","Magic Resistance":"Nil","Morale":"Fearless (20)","Movement":"Sw 18","No. Appearing":"1-2","No. of Attacks":"1","Organization":"Solitary","Size":"H (20' long)","Special Attacks":"Swallow whole (some: constriction)","Special Defenses":"Nil","THAC0":"11","Treasure":"Nil","XP Value":"5,000"}},"title":"Fish, Deep Ocean"},"sources":["2173","Dragon235"],"statblock_names":[],"title":"Fish, Deep Ocean","prev_key":"fishasca","next_key":"fishgian","monster_path":"/appendix/fishdeoc"}},"staticQueryHashes":[],"slicesMap":{}}
