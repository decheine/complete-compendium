While the powers listed above are the most common, some aarakocra have different or additional powers.</p><p class=\"f\">A race of intelligent, birdlike creatures living in the deepest deserts of Athas, the rare Athasian <a href=\"/appendix/aarakocr\">aarakocra</a> spends its time soaring on thermals in search of food.</p><p>The aarakocra is 7 to 8 feet tall with a wingspan of 20 feet or more. Because of its large wingspan, an aarakocra can carry as much as 75% of its own body weight and still fly easily. An aarakocra can fly a short distance carrying a burden equaling 125% of its own body weight. The average body weight of a full grown male is 100 pounds and a female is 85 pounds.</p><p>Each wing has a &ldquo;hand&rdquo; at its midpoint, consisting of three fingers and an opposable thumb. The fourth finger forms the rigid leading edge of the wing. In flight the hands cannot be used, but on the ground the aarakocra can use its hands almost as a human would. The aarakocra's body is protected by a thin bony plate on the chest, much like a solid rib cage. Talons on its legs can be used as claws and can be retracted to reveal a second set of hands, also with three fingers and an opposable thumb. Except for the chest plate, the entire skeleton is hollow and extremely fragile.</p><p>From a distance, the Athasian aarakocra resembles a huge <a href=\"/appendix/bird\">vulture</a>. Its black eyes, set in the front of the head, provide excellent vision over a long range. The plumage is generally black with a white collar for adult males and black or brown with a smaller white collar for females. Adolescents are a mixture of brown and black. The beak is large and covers most of the head. Plumage begins at the crown of the head and is darker near the head, except for the collar. Athasian aarakocra speak their own language and the languages of vultures and other large birds. Some speak the common tongue (5% to 10% chance depending on how deep in the wastelands a tribe lives).</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Combat:</b> Aarakocra can fight in the air or on the ground. They prefer aerial combat since their bones are too fragile to withstand a solid blow from a human-sized opponent. In combat against creatures on the ground, they prefer to fly over their victim and drop weighted nets. Some aarakocra use darts to harass ground-based opponents.</p><p>If their opponents can fly, the aarakocra generally forgo the use of the net, although large groups sometimes use nets on flying creatures. Normally, aarakocra attack flying creatures with long spears, diving from above and allowing the momentum to carry the spear through the target. Such an attack doubles the damage if the aarakocra have been able to dive at least 50 feet. Only the very largest aarakocra can carry more than one of these spears, they can attack with both at once with no penalty, causing double damage on each strike. All diving attacks are made at +4 and should be treated as a charge attack. All other penalties and restrictions of charge attacks apply.</p><p>The effect of the aarakocra's nets depends on if the opponent is flying at the time it becomes entangled. Creatures on the ground that are hit by a net are entangled and unable to participate in any combat until they make a successful Strength check to get free of the net. Flying creatures hit by a net can no longer fly and immediately begin falling. If they cannot escape the net or use some magical means to arrest the fall, normal falling damage applies.</p><p>Unless victims are entangled in nets, aarakocra are cautious in ground combat. If the aarakocra outnumber their opponents they advance in a straight line and thrust with their spears. If outnumbered, or the opponents are particularly tough, the aarakocra withdraw. Victims entangled in nets are killed or incapacitated for use as food or ransom.</p><p>Athasian aarakocra are mindful of their physical limitations as well as their comparatively low psionic abilities. They do not normally initiate psionic combat. At the first sign of psionic powers from any of their victims, however, all aarakocra that have some ability will use whatever attack and defense modes they can in an attempt to destroy the threat. Large groups of is or more aarakocra may initiate psionic combat if their leaders feel they can win quickly and avoid physical combat.</p><p>In desperation, an aarakocra can attempt to bite an opponent in combat. Because of the unwieldiness of its beak, the aarakocra has a THAC0 of 18 if attacking with this appendage. Further, the birdman causes only 1d2 points of damage with the beak.</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Habitat/Society:</b> Athasian aarakocra live in tribes with 6-20 (2d8+4) members, depending on the prestige of the leader. The largest tribe ever recorded had 50 members. The tribal hunting territory depends on the size of the tribe, usually about 500 square miles for a tribe of 10 members. There are no rigid boundaries between tribes and border disputes are not uncommon.</p><p>Alignments of tribe members are similar to the alignment of the leader. A tribe that has a leader who is neutral good may have neutral good, chaotic good, lawful good, and true neutral members. A predominantly evil tribe does not recognize boundaries with other tribes and treats other tribes as inferior beings to be eliminated.</p><p>Athasian aarakocra aren't happy in enclosed spaces, but they they take refuge in a cave or building if necessary.</p><p>Nonevil tribes live in rocky aeries in the highest peaks they can find. Evil tribes are normally nomadic and use an aerie made by another tribe if they need to remain in an area for a long time, even if they have to evict the tribe that made the nest.</p><p>Aarakocra aren't friendly toward intruders in their territory, especially caravans. They try to extract a toll from the caravan for passage through the desert. Good-aligned tribes allow unhindered passage of caravans that pay a tribute. If someone refuses to pay the tribute, the aarakocra try to capture scouts or outriders from the party and hold them until an even larger tribute is paid. The payment may be either livestock or shiny objects. Aarakocra are smart enough not to be taken in by glass baubles instead of gems, although they cannot tell the difference between the more common gems and the rare ones.</p><p>Evil tribes ask for tribute and often attack a caravan whether it pays or not. Aarakocra always demand shiny objects such as stones. These tribes find humans and demihumans to be quite tasty and prefer them to other food.</p><p>Good-aligned tribes of aarakocra sometimes return a lost traveler to the edge of the desert after first removing any valuables the traveler may be carrying. On very rare occasions a tribe might return a lost group of travelers to the more frequently traveled parts of the desert, again after first taking any valuables as payment.</p><p>The oldest male is the leader of the tribal hunting party and has 4+4 Hit Dice. The oldest female is in charge of the tribal aerie and has 3+3 HD. In tribes that have more than 15 members, the next oldest aarakocra serves as shaman and has 3+3 HD; the shaman completes the triumvirate necessary for proper worship and the summoning of elementals. (Interestingly, no magic-using aarakocra has ever been recorded.) Tribes without a shaman cannot summon <a href=\"/appendix/element1\">air elementals</a>, which is an important part of aarakocra culture.</p><p>The shaman is the leader of the daily sun worship. Aarakocra worship the sun because it provides them with the thermals they need to soar in search of food. The shaman also leads the mystic rituals used to summon an air elemental. Summoning an air elemental is usually done only in preparation for the tribe's most sacred ceremony, the hunt. Small tribes must band together for this ceremony to allow the triumvirate to be formed.</p><p>The ceremony to summon an air elemental must be conducted at dawn and requires the oldest male and female to emit a highpitched keening whistle. The shaman conducts an intricate dance around them, simultaneously chanting an ancient summoning mantra.</p><p>The hunt is the final part of the initiation of adolescent aarakocra to adulthood and often takes the tribe far from their normal teritory. The target is always a <a href=\"/appendix/drakalsi\">silt drake</a>. The hunt is the only time the females leave the relative safety of the nest. Even an evil tribe will not interfere with a tribe on a hunt. An air elemental is often summoned to help find the drake, but never takes part in the actual combat. Although the adult members of the tribe take part in the initial phases of the combat, it is the initiates who deliver the final, killing blows to me drake. Scars from the hunt are considered a mark of pride among all aarakocra.</p><p>The females spend about eight months of the year incubating their eggs. Athasian aarakocra mate for life and a pair normally produces as many as 10 offspring. A female lays one egg a year. Constant incubation is not required because of the high daytime temperatures, so the females can maintain the nest and keep the tribe's treasure in order.</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Ecology:</b> Athasian aarakocra are high on the food chain and have no natural enemies other than <a href=\"/appendix/drakatha\">drakes</a>. Unless evil, aarakocra leave their own territory only to hunt the silt drake and return as soon as possible when the hunt is over. (Evil aarakocra attack others, as noted above.) Aarakocra eggs and hatchlings are sought after by wealthy land owners who wish to use the creatures as scouts and sentries. An egg can bring as much as 10 cp in Tyr's marketplace. Tribes that have had eggs or hatchlings stolen have long memories and sometimes take revenge against the thief at a later date. Captive aarakocra join any tribe they come in contact with.</p><p>Athasian aarakocra have a natural life span of 21-30 years.</p>\n","images":["<img src=\"grf/ds.gif\" width=\"150\" height=\"75\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Dark Sun\" title=\"Dark Sun\" align=\"right\">","<img src=\"img/aarakath.gif\" alt=\"Aarakocra (Athas)\" title=\"Aarakocra (Athas)\" border=\"0\" width=\"300\" height=\"360\" style=\"text-align:right;\" align=\"right\">","<img src=\"grf/add2_01.gif\" width=\"200\" height=\"56\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Advanced Dungeons & Dragons 2nd Edition\">"],"setting":"Dark Sun","statblock":{"Aarakocra (Athas)":{"Activity Cycle":"Day","Alignment":"Any","Armor Class":"7","Climate/Terrain":"Deep desert","Damage/Attack":"1d3/1d3 or by weapon","Diet":"Carnivore","Frequency":"Rare","Hit Dice":"2+2","Intelligence":"Average (8-10)","Magic Resistance":"Nil","Morale":"Steady (11)","Movement":"6, Fl 36 (C)","No. Appearing":"1d10","No. of Attacks":"2","Organization":"Tribal","Size":"M (20'+ wingspan)","Special Attacks":"Nil","Special Defenses":"Nil","THAC0":"17","Treasure":"Varies","XP Value":"65"}},"title":"Aarakocra (Athas)"},"sources":["2433"],"statblock_names":[],"title":"Aarakocra (Athas)","prev_key":"zygraat","next_key":"aarakocr","monster_path":"/appendix/aarakath"}}},"pageContext":{"monster_key":"lizkinmy","monster_data":{"TSR":["2501"],"fullBody":"    <table cellspacing=\"0\" cellpadding=\"0\"><tr class=\"bk\"><th> </th><th class=\"cn\">Cayman</th><th class=\"cn\">Chameleon Man</th><th class=\"cn\">Gator Man</th><th class=\"cn\">Sis'thik</th></tr><tr><th>Climate/Terrain:</th><td>Temperate or subtropical swamp or forests</td><td>Nonarctic woods, plains, or caverns</td><td>Tropical or subtropical swamp</td><td>Tropical or subtropical desert</td></tr><tr><th>Frequency:</th><td>Uncommon</td><td>Rare</td><td>Rare</td><td>Rare</td></tr><tr><th>Organization:</th><td>Village</td><td>Clan</td><td>Village</td><td>Tribe</td></tr><tr><th>Activity Cycle:</th><td>Any</td><td>Any</td><td>Night</td><td>Any</td></tr><tr><th>Diet:</th><td>Omnivore</td><td>Omnivore</td><td>Carnivore</td><td>Omnivore</td></tr><tr><th>Intelligence:</th><td>Average (8-10)</td><td>Average (8-10)</td><td>Low (5-7)</td><td>Average (8-10)</td></tr><tr><th>Treasure:</th><td>K</td><td>E (Q,S)</td><td>M</td><td>A</td></tr><tr><th>Alignment:</th><td>Neutral</td><td>Neutral</td><td>Chaotic evil</td><td>Neutral evil</td></tr><tr><th>No. Appearing:</th><td>10d6</td><td>2d4</td><td>1d6</td><td>3d6</td></tr><tr><th>Armor Class:</th><td>7</td><td>10</td><td>1</td><td>5 (4 with armor)</td></tr><tr><th>Movement:</th><td>9</td><td>12</td><td>12, Sw 18</td><td>9</td></tr><tr><th>Hit Dice:</th><td>2</td><td>2</td><td>7</td><td>3+3</td></tr><tr><th>THAC0:</th><td>19</td><td>19</td><td>13</td><td>17</td></tr><tr><th>No. of Attacks:</th><td>1</td><td>1</td><td>2</td><td>1 or 3</td></tr><tr><th>Damage/Attack:</th><td>1d3 (bite) or by weapon</td><td>By weapon</td><td>2d4 (bite)<br>and by weapon +2</td><td>By weapon +2 or 1d6 (claw)/1d6 (claw)/1d3 (bite)</td></tr><tr><th>Special Attacks:</th><td>Surprise</td><td>Dimension door</td><td>Nil</td><td>Nil</td></tr><tr><th>Special Defenses:</th><td>Stealth</td><td>Nil</td><td>Nil</td><td>Fire resistance</td></tr><tr><th>Magic Resistance:</th><td>Nil</td><td>Nil</td><td>Nil</td><td>Nil</td></tr><tr><th>Size:</th><td>S (1' tall)</td><td>M (7' tall)</td><td>L (8' tall)</td><td>M (6' tall)</td></tr><tr><th>Morale:</th><td>Average (9)</td><td>Average (10)</td><td>Champion (15)</td><td>Elite (13)</td></tr><tr><th>XP Value:</th><td>65<br>Shaman: 175</td><td>120<br>Bodyguard: 175<br>Leader: 420</td><td>420<br>Leader: 650</td><td>175<br>Bodyguard: 270<br>Shaman: 650<br>Queen: 975</td></tr></table><p class=\"f\"><img src=\"/img/spc/lizkinmy.gif\" width=\"300\" height=\"360\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Lizard Kin (Mystara), Chameleon Man and Sis'thik\" title=\"Lizard Kin (Mystara), Chameleon Man and Sis'thik\" style=\"float:right\">The lizard-kin of Mystara share an ancient lineage. The chameleon men are the oldest of these races; some believe that caymen, gator men, sis'thik, and standard <a href=\"/appendix/lizarman\">lizard men</a> all descend from a common ancestor related to chameleon men. Relations between lizard men and the four lizard-kin races, however, range from indifferent at best to hostile at worst.</p><h2>Cayman</h2><p class=\"f\">These reptilian humanoids stand about a foot tall, with bodies sheathed in rough brown or green skin. Their black, pupil-less eyes boast infravision with a 90-foot range.</p><p>Caymen are intelligent and sociable, dwelling together in vilages. Their native language sounds like simple hisses and chitters to other creatures. Fortunately, caymen also speak Common. In addition, some may know the languages of subterranean creatures living nearby.</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Combat:</b> Caymen usually avoid conflict, except in self-defense or when protecting their villages, territory, or food sources. When pressed, they use bone weapons, usually small javelins and large daggers. Each weapon inflicts 1d6 points of damage.</p><p>In general, caymen dislike frontal assaults. They prefer to surprise an opponent, make a few quick attacks, then flee.</p><p>All caymen can move silently and hide in shadows with a 40% chance of success. They use these skills to evade combat, or to surprise foes with whom they must fight; those attacked by a concealed cayman suffer a -2 penalty to surprise rolls.</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Habitat/Society:</b> Caymen build underground villages of tunnels and chambers 1 to 2 feet high. They protect these lairs with palisades of packed dirt and woven reeds. The walls have many entrances, aU of them the equivalent of concealed doors.</p><p>Each cayman village includes 10d6 adults, and half that many noncombatant offspring. Immature caymen reach adulthood in one year. Villages are led by a shaman, equivalent to a priest of 5th to 7th level. These shamans live longer than the average cayman (60 years, as opposed to the normal 40-year life span), so their hides grow tough and improve their Armor Class to AC 6. With a shaman in a cayman party, the creatures' morale increases by 1 point.</p><p>Not only do the better warriors use bone weapons and tools, they wear bone and feather headdresses. The more elaborate the headdress, the greater the warrior - though these caymen avoid wearing such adornments in battle, not wishing to alert the enemy to their superior abilities.</p><p>These lizard-kin get along well with <a href=\"/appendix/gnome\">gnomes</a> and tolerate lizard men. However, due to the caymen's small size, evil subterranean races often take them as slaves.</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Ecology:</b> Caymen enjoy eating giant-sized reptiles and amphibians but sometimes fall prey themselves to large predators. They make reliable guides in swamps.</p><h2>Chameleon Man</h2><p class=\"f\">The reclusive chameleon men possess a bit of <a href=\"/appendix/dragon\">dragon</a> ancestry. In their homes far from human and demihuman civilizations, they generally can avoid contact with strangers.</p><p>Chameleon men stand 7 feet tall, and their spindly arms and legs make them look quite thin. They move with a stride that other races find gangling and awkward. Chameleon men have multicolored, somewhat scaly skin with stripes of many colors: red, blue, green, yellow, brown, orange, black, and white (though few chameleon men have every possible hue). The colors seem to shift and swirl when the creatures walk (a trick of the light as it plays off their scales).</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Combat:</b> Chameleon men usually arm themselves with light weapons: daggers, spears, or dubs. They never wear armor, as it interferes with their natural abilities; they would rather blend in with the scenery than fight openly.</p><p>By far the most useful feature of the chameleon men remains their vanishing ability, which they use to avoid combat or to surround opponents. Each round, a chameleon man can vanish and reappear up to 120 feet away. This ability essentially mirrors the wizard spell dimension door, with a 120-foot range limitation. The creatures wield such precise control over this ability that they never reappear in midair or inside solid objects. Of course, a chameleon man cannot appear in the exact spot as someone or something else. These lizard-kin cannot attack in the round that they use this ability.</p><p>Chameleon man leaders - or Lords of Shade and Hue - have 4 Hit Dice and 1d20+10 constant bodyguards with 3 Hit Dice. Leaders can blend in with any natural background and have a 90% chance to remain undetected while unmoving. Lords and their bodyguards have a morale of Average (9).</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Habitat/Society:</b> All chameleon man settlements feature a magical site called a tookoo. The tookoo of a cave-dwelling clan might be a special grotto that glistens with arcane crystals. Forest dwellers might revere an ancient tree of strong magic. These sites always radiate magic and enable chameleon men to fight at a +2 bonus to attack and damage rolls. When fighting for their tookoos or homes, their morale rises to Fearless (20).</p><p>Once a year chameleon men shed their skin, much as a lizard does. They save the skin for a vital purpose: reproduction. As this race has no female gender, chameleon men reproduce by placing their old skins in their clan's tookoo. The offering has a 60% chance of magically transforming into a young chameleon man, which grows to maturity in just eight weeks.</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Ecology:</b> Chameleon men enjoy watching over old woods and caverns, maintaining the harmony of nature. They are sometimes hunted by lizard men, who fear their ability to vanish. These lizard-kin subsist on crops they cultivate and fish. Less scrupulous wizards prize a chameleon man's skin as a component for making robes of blending.</p><h2>Gator Man</h2><p class=\"f\">Gator men - horrible, lizardlike homanoids - result from magical experiments on lizard men that went awry. The escapees have thrived, expanding their ranks into a new race.</p><p>These lizard-kin stand 7 to 8 feet tall, their bodies covered in dark green scales. They have alligator heads and mouths with prominent, sharp teeth. Slitlike black pupils split their red eyes.</p><p>Gator men speak Common and the language of lizard men. They refuse to negotiate with strangers, preferring instead to attack unwary parties of humans and demihumans.</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Combat:</b> Gator men possess formidable Strength (18), and their bite causes 2d4 hit points of damage. Many cany large, crude swords, which they wield with a +1 bonus to attack and +2 bonus to damage rolls.</p><p>A huge specimen, the village chief can cause 3d4 points of damage with its bite. A chief wields a sword with Strength 19, gaining a +3 bonus to attack and a +7 bonus to damage rolls.</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Habitat/Society:</b> During experiments in which evil mages tried to fuse lizard men and alligators, several specimens managed to escape and fled into the swamps. Once there, they reproduced rapidly, overcoming all predators and competitors.</p><p>Some tribes of gator men reportedly follow shamans with spellcasting abilities equivalent to those of 7th-level clerics.</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Ecology:</b> Gator men consider themselves the mortal enemies of lizard men, usually attacking them on sight in an effort to drive the lizard men away from gator man homeland.</p><p>Raiding parties of gator men often make sweeps of isolated settlements for fresh human meat to supplement their diet of lizards, alligators, and other animals native to swampland.</p><h2>Sis'thik (Desert Scourge)</h2><p class=\"f\">In burning deserts live nomadic humanoids called Sis'thik, a proud race of reptilian warriors that fear nothing.</p><p>Sis'thik have thick, leathery light tan skin that lets them blend in with the arid terrain. Their nostrils can seal out dust, and transparent eye screens allow them to see in sandstorms.</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Combat:</b> Female sis'thik use scimitars in combat and sometimes employ shields (boosting their AC to 4). These females boast great strength, inklicting a +2 bonus to damage rolls using melee weapons. Males, if forced, attack with daws and bite.</p><p>Normal fires do not affect sis'thik; plus, these lizard-kin suffer only 1 point of damage per die of magical fire damage.</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Habitat/Society:</b> Sis'thik tribes have 3d6 x 10 adult members, plus 4d6 noncombatant children. Female sis'thik control the tribes and do all the fighting. The males seem slow and stupid, existing only for mating and drudge work. Females do not reproduce often, consideling how much other work they have to do. Most lay a clutch of 2d4 eggs every other year.</p><p>Each sis'thik tribe follows a queen with 8 Hit Dice, who receives a +3 bonus to damage rolls. The queen is accompanied at all times by 2d4 bodyguards, each with 4+1 Hit Dice. Each tribe also includes 1d4 shamans of 1st to 8th levels.Some sis'thik tribes breed xytar lizards as mounts; two sis'thik can ride a smgle xytar. In addition, these lizard-kin have been known to cooperate with <a href=\"/appendix/dragcblu\">blue dragons</a>.</p><p>Each sis'thik tribe has its own territory. Any who wish to cross it must debase themselves before the queen and shower the tribe with gifts of wine, food, and metal items. Sis'thik sometimes build shelters of mud brick, usually near oases and other resting places. They do not appreciate others using these structures without permission.</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Ecology:</b> Sis'thik prey on creatures such as ant lions, camels, jackals, and wyvems. They savor the taste of copper dragon flesh, which has resulted in enmity between the two races. These lizardkin also enjoy eating figs, dates, and cacti.</p>\n","images":["<img src=\"grf/ms.gif\" width=\"150\" height=\"75\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Mystara\" title=\"Mystara\" align=\"right\">","<img src=\"/img/spc/lizkinmy.gif\" width=\"300\" height=\"360\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Lizard Kin (Mystara), Chameleon Man and Sis'thik\" title=\"Lizard Kin (Mystara), Chameleon Man and Sis'thik\" style=\"float:right\">","<img src=\"grf/add2_01.gif\" width=\"200\" height=\"56\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Advanced Dungeons & Dragons 2nd Edition\">"],"setting":"Mystara","statblock":{"Cayman":{"Activity Cycle":"Any","Alignment":"Neutral","Armor Class":"7","Climate/Terrain":"Temperate or subtropical swamp or forests","Damage/Attack":"1d3 (bite) or by weapon","Diet":"Omnivore","Frequency":"Uncommon","Hit Dice":"2","Intelligence":"Average (8-10)","Magic Resistance":"Nil","Morale":"Average (9)","Movement":"9","No. Appearing":"10d6","No. of Attacks":"1","Organization":"Village","Size":"S (1' tall)","Special Attacks":"Surprise","Special Defenses":"Stealth","THAC0":"19","Treasure":"K","XP Value":"65<br>Shaman: 175"},"Chameleon Man":{"Activity Cycle":"Any","Alignment":"Neutral","Armor Class":"10","Climate/Terrain":"Nonarctic woods, plains, or caverns","Damage/Attack":"By weapon","Diet":"Omnivore","Frequency":"Rare","Hit Dice":"2","Intelligence":"Average (8-10)","Magic Resistance":"Nil","Morale":"Average (10)","Movement":"12","No. Appearing":"2d4","No. of Attacks":"1","Organization":"Clan","Size":"M (7' tall)","Special Attacks":"Dimension door","Special Defenses":"Nil","THAC0":"19","Treasure":"E (Q,S)","XP Value":"120<br>Bodyguard: 175<br>Leader: 420"},"Gator Man":{"Activity Cycle":"Night","Alignment":"Chaotic evil","Armor Class":"1","Climate/Terrain":"Tropical or subtropical swamp","Damage/Attack":"2d4 (bite)<br>and by weapon +2","Diet":"Carnivore","Frequency":"Rare","Hit Dice":"7","Intelligence":"Low (5-7)","Magic Resistance":"Nil","Morale":"Champion (15)","Movement":"12, Sw 18","No. Appearing":"1d6","No. of Attacks":"2","Organization":"Village","Size":"L (8' tall)","Special Attacks":"Nil","Special Defenses":"Nil","THAC0":"13","Treasure":"M","XP Value":"420<br>Leader: 650"},"Sis'thik":{"Activity Cycle":"Any","Alignment":"Neutral evil","Armor Class":"5 (4 with armor)","Climate/Terrain":"Tropical or subtropical desert","Damage/Attack":"By weapon +2 or 1d6 (claw)/1d6 (claw)/1d3 (bite)","Diet":"Omnivore","Frequency":"Rare","Hit Dice":"3+3","Intelligence":"Average (8-10)","Magic Resistance":"Nil","Morale":"Elite (13)","Movement":"9","No. Appearing":"3d6","No. of Attacks":"1 or 3","Organization":"Tribe","Size":"M (6' tall)","Special Attacks":"Nil","Special Defenses":"Fire resistance","THAC0":"17","Treasure":"A","XP Value":"175<br>Bodyguard: 270<br>Shaman: 650<br>Queen: 975"}},"title":"Lizard-kin (Mystara)"},"sources":["2501"],"statblock_names":[],"title":"Lizard-kin (Mystara)","prev_key":"lizatund","next_key":"lizkinsc","monster_path":"/appendix/lizkinmy"}},"staticQueryHashes":[],"slicesMap":{}}
