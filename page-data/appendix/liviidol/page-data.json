While the powers listed above are the most common, some aarakocra have different or additional powers.</p><p class=\"f\">A race of intelligent, birdlike creatures living in the deepest deserts of Athas, the rare Athasian <a href=\"/appendix/aarakocr\">aarakocra</a> spends its time soaring on thermals in search of food.</p><p>The aarakocra is 7 to 8 feet tall with a wingspan of 20 feet or more. Because of its large wingspan, an aarakocra can carry as much as 75% of its own body weight and still fly easily. An aarakocra can fly a short distance carrying a burden equaling 125% of its own body weight. The average body weight of a full grown male is 100 pounds and a female is 85 pounds.</p><p>Each wing has a &ldquo;hand&rdquo; at its midpoint, consisting of three fingers and an opposable thumb. The fourth finger forms the rigid leading edge of the wing. In flight the hands cannot be used, but on the ground the aarakocra can use its hands almost as a human would. The aarakocra's body is protected by a thin bony plate on the chest, much like a solid rib cage. Talons on its legs can be used as claws and can be retracted to reveal a second set of hands, also with three fingers and an opposable thumb. Except for the chest plate, the entire skeleton is hollow and extremely fragile.</p><p>From a distance, the Athasian aarakocra resembles a huge <a href=\"/appendix/bird\">vulture</a>. Its black eyes, set in the front of the head, provide excellent vision over a long range. The plumage is generally black with a white collar for adult males and black or brown with a smaller white collar for females. Adolescents are a mixture of brown and black. The beak is large and covers most of the head. Plumage begins at the crown of the head and is darker near the head, except for the collar. Athasian aarakocra speak their own language and the languages of vultures and other large birds. Some speak the common tongue (5% to 10% chance depending on how deep in the wastelands a tribe lives).</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Combat:</b> Aarakocra can fight in the air or on the ground. They prefer aerial combat since their bones are too fragile to withstand a solid blow from a human-sized opponent. In combat against creatures on the ground, they prefer to fly over their victim and drop weighted nets. Some aarakocra use darts to harass ground-based opponents.</p><p>If their opponents can fly, the aarakocra generally forgo the use of the net, although large groups sometimes use nets on flying creatures. Normally, aarakocra attack flying creatures with long spears, diving from above and allowing the momentum to carry the spear through the target. Such an attack doubles the damage if the aarakocra have been able to dive at least 50 feet. Only the very largest aarakocra can carry more than one of these spears, they can attack with both at once with no penalty, causing double damage on each strike. All diving attacks are made at +4 and should be treated as a charge attack. All other penalties and restrictions of charge attacks apply.</p><p>The effect of the aarakocra's nets depends on if the opponent is flying at the time it becomes entangled. Creatures on the ground that are hit by a net are entangled and unable to participate in any combat until they make a successful Strength check to get free of the net. Flying creatures hit by a net can no longer fly and immediately begin falling. If they cannot escape the net or use some magical means to arrest the fall, normal falling damage applies.</p><p>Unless victims are entangled in nets, aarakocra are cautious in ground combat. If the aarakocra outnumber their opponents they advance in a straight line and thrust with their spears. If outnumbered, or the opponents are particularly tough, the aarakocra withdraw. Victims entangled in nets are killed or incapacitated for use as food or ransom.</p><p>Athasian aarakocra are mindful of their physical limitations as well as their comparatively low psionic abilities. They do not normally initiate psionic combat. At the first sign of psionic powers from any of their victims, however, all aarakocra that have some ability will use whatever attack and defense modes they can in an attempt to destroy the threat. Large groups of is or more aarakocra may initiate psionic combat if their leaders feel they can win quickly and avoid physical combat.</p><p>In desperation, an aarakocra can attempt to bite an opponent in combat. Because of the unwieldiness of its beak, the aarakocra has a THAC0 of 18 if attacking with this appendage. Further, the birdman causes only 1d2 points of damage with the beak.</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Habitat/Society:</b> Athasian aarakocra live in tribes with 6-20 (2d8+4) members, depending on the prestige of the leader. The largest tribe ever recorded had 50 members. The tribal hunting territory depends on the size of the tribe, usually about 500 square miles for a tribe of 10 members. There are no rigid boundaries between tribes and border disputes are not uncommon.</p><p>Alignments of tribe members are similar to the alignment of the leader. A tribe that has a leader who is neutral good may have neutral good, chaotic good, lawful good, and true neutral members. A predominantly evil tribe does not recognize boundaries with other tribes and treats other tribes as inferior beings to be eliminated.</p><p>Athasian aarakocra aren't happy in enclosed spaces, but they they take refuge in a cave or building if necessary.</p><p>Nonevil tribes live in rocky aeries in the highest peaks they can find. Evil tribes are normally nomadic and use an aerie made by another tribe if they need to remain in an area for a long time, even if they have to evict the tribe that made the nest.</p><p>Aarakocra aren't friendly toward intruders in their territory, especially caravans. They try to extract a toll from the caravan for passage through the desert. Good-aligned tribes allow unhindered passage of caravans that pay a tribute. If someone refuses to pay the tribute, the aarakocra try to capture scouts or outriders from the party and hold them until an even larger tribute is paid. The payment may be either livestock or shiny objects. Aarakocra are smart enough not to be taken in by glass baubles instead of gems, although they cannot tell the difference between the more common gems and the rare ones.</p><p>Evil tribes ask for tribute and often attack a caravan whether it pays or not. Aarakocra always demand shiny objects such as stones. These tribes find humans and demihumans to be quite tasty and prefer them to other food.</p><p>Good-aligned tribes of aarakocra sometimes return a lost traveler to the edge of the desert after first removing any valuables the traveler may be carrying. On very rare occasions a tribe might return a lost group of travelers to the more frequently traveled parts of the desert, again after first taking any valuables as payment.</p><p>The oldest male is the leader of the tribal hunting party and has 4+4 Hit Dice. The oldest female is in charge of the tribal aerie and has 3+3 HD. In tribes that have more than 15 members, the next oldest aarakocra serves as shaman and has 3+3 HD; the shaman completes the triumvirate necessary for proper worship and the summoning of elementals. (Interestingly, no magic-using aarakocra has ever been recorded.) Tribes without a shaman cannot summon <a href=\"/appendix/element1\">air elementals</a>, which is an important part of aarakocra culture.</p><p>The shaman is the leader of the daily sun worship. Aarakocra worship the sun because it provides them with the thermals they need to soar in search of food. The shaman also leads the mystic rituals used to summon an air elemental. Summoning an air elemental is usually done only in preparation for the tribe's most sacred ceremony, the hunt. Small tribes must band together for this ceremony to allow the triumvirate to be formed.</p><p>The ceremony to summon an air elemental must be conducted at dawn and requires the oldest male and female to emit a highpitched keening whistle. The shaman conducts an intricate dance around them, simultaneously chanting an ancient summoning mantra.</p><p>The hunt is the final part of the initiation of adolescent aarakocra to adulthood and often takes the tribe far from their normal teritory. The target is always a <a href=\"/appendix/drakalsi\">silt drake</a>. The hunt is the only time the females leave the relative safety of the nest. Even an evil tribe will not interfere with a tribe on a hunt. An air elemental is often summoned to help find the drake, but never takes part in the actual combat. Although the adult members of the tribe take part in the initial phases of the combat, it is the initiates who deliver the final, killing blows to me drake. Scars from the hunt are considered a mark of pride among all aarakocra.</p><p>The females spend about eight months of the year incubating their eggs. Athasian aarakocra mate for life and a pair normally produces as many as 10 offspring. A female lays one egg a year. Constant incubation is not required because of the high daytime temperatures, so the females can maintain the nest and keep the tribe's treasure in order.</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Ecology:</b> Athasian aarakocra are high on the food chain and have no natural enemies other than <a href=\"/appendix/drakatha\">drakes</a>. Unless evil, aarakocra leave their own territory only to hunt the silt drake and return as soon as possible when the hunt is over. (Evil aarakocra attack others, as noted above.) Aarakocra eggs and hatchlings are sought after by wealthy land owners who wish to use the creatures as scouts and sentries. An egg can bring as much as 10 cp in Tyr's marketplace. Tribes that have had eggs or hatchlings stolen have long memories and sometimes take revenge against the thief at a later date. Captive aarakocra join any tribe they come in contact with.</p><p>Athasian aarakocra have a natural life span of 21-30 years.</p>\n","images":["<img src=\"grf/ds.gif\" width=\"150\" height=\"75\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Dark Sun\" title=\"Dark Sun\" align=\"right\">","<img src=\"img/aarakath.gif\" alt=\"Aarakocra (Athas)\" title=\"Aarakocra (Athas)\" border=\"0\" width=\"300\" height=\"360\" style=\"text-align:right;\" align=\"right\">","<img src=\"grf/add2_01.gif\" width=\"200\" height=\"56\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Advanced Dungeons & Dragons 2nd Edition\">"],"setting":"Dark Sun","statblock":{"Aarakocra (Athas)":{"Activity Cycle":"Day","Alignment":"Any","Armor Class":"7","Climate/Terrain":"Deep desert","Damage/Attack":"1d3/1d3 or by weapon","Diet":"Carnivore","Frequency":"Rare","Hit Dice":"2+2","Intelligence":"Average (8-10)","Magic Resistance":"Nil","Morale":"Steady (11)","Movement":"6, Fl 36 (C)","No. Appearing":"1d10","No. of Attacks":"2","Organization":"Tribal","Size":"M (20'+ wingspan)","Special Attacks":"Nil","Special Defenses":"Nil","THAC0":"17","Treasure":"Varies","XP Value":"65"}},"title":"Aarakocra (Athas)"},"sources":["2433"],"statblock_names":[],"title":"Aarakocra (Athas)","prev_key":"zygraat","next_key":"aarakocr","monster_path":"/appendix/aarakath"}}},"pageContext":{"monster_key":"liviidol","monster_data":{"TSR":["2129"],"fullBody":"  <table cellspacing=\"0\" cellpadding=\"0\"><tr class=\"bk\"><th> </th><th class=\"cn\">Animal</th><th class=\"cn\">Death</th><th class=\"cn\">Elemental</th><th class=\"cn\">Healing</th></tr><tr><th>Climate/Terrain:</th><td>Any</td><td>Any</td><td>Any</td><td>Any</td></tr><tr><th>Frequency:</th><td>Very rare</td><td>Very rare</td><td>Very rare</td><td>Very rare</td></tr><tr><th>Organization:</th><td>Solitary</td><td>Solitary</td><td>Solitary</td><td>Solitary</td></tr><tr><th>Activity Cycle:</th><td>Any</td><td>Any</td><td>Any</td><td>Any</td></tr><tr><th>Diet:</th><td>Sacrifices</td><td>Sacrifices</td><td>Sacrifices</td><td>Sacrifices</td></tr><tr><th>Intelligence:</th><td>Semi (2-4)</td><td>Semi (2-4)</td><td>Semi (2-4)</td><td>Semi (2-4)</td></tr><tr><th>Treasure:</th><td>Incidental</td><td>Incidental</td><td>Incidental</td><td>Incidental</td></tr><tr><th>Alignment:</th><td>Lawful neutral</td><td>Neutral Evil</td><td>Chaotic neutral</td><td>Neutral good</td></tr><tr><th>No. Appearing:</th><td>1</td><td>1</td><td>1</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><th>Armor Class:</th><td>4</td><td>4</td><td>Nil</td><td>4</td></tr><tr><th>Movement:</th><td>6</td><td>3</td><td>4</td><td>3</td></tr><tr><th>Hit Dice:</th><td>9</td><td>16</td><td>12</td><td>12</td></tr><tr><th>THAC0:</th><td>3</td><td>3</td><td>3</td><td>3</td></tr><tr><th>No. of Attacks:</th><td>1</td><td>1</td><td>1</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><th>Damage/Attack:</th><td>4-32</td><td>4-32</td><td>4-32</td><td>4-32</td></tr><tr><th>Special Attacks:</th><td>Charm</td><td>Charm</td><td>Charm</td><td>Charm</td></tr><tr><th>Special Defenses:</th><td>Immune to most spells, +3 or better weapon to hit</td><td>Immune to most spells, +3 or better weapon to hit</td><td>Immune to most spells, +3 or better weapon to hit</td><td>Immune to most spells, +3 or better weapon to hit</td></tr><tr><th>Magic Resistance:</th><td>Nil</td><td>Nil</td><td>Nil</td><td>Nil</td></tr><tr><th>Size:</th><td>L (10-12' tall)</td><td>L (10-12' tall)</td><td>L (10-12' tall)</td><td>L (10-12' tall)</td></tr><tr><th>Morale:</th><td>Fearless (20)</td><td>Fearless (20)</td><td>Fearless (20)</td><td>Fearless (20)</td></tr><tr><th>XP Value:</th><td>9,000</td><td>16,000</td><td>12,000</td><td>12,000</td></tr></table><p class=\"f\">Living idols are moving stone statues, each with one particular power and defense. The remnants of ancient, forgotten empires and religions, they often inspire strange cults which are opposed by even the most pragmatic of modern faiths.</p><p>Living idols appear to be very large stone statues. They can be of any shape, either monster, animal, human, or demihuman. One feature common to all of them is their incredible age. All show signs of heavy weathering and erosion, their once smooth surface riddled with small cracks, pock marks, and holes. Some living idols are no longer completely intact, missing an arm, leg, or other appendage. A few are so ancient as to be little more than weathered standing stones.</p><p>The magic of these idols is so strong that it is not dispelled until the entire statue is reduced to small fragments. Until that time, the largest surviving chunk retains the enchantment.</p><p>Idols with two or more appendages still intact are capable of moving at a rate of 6; those with one appendage drag themselves along at a rate of 3. Depending upon the amount of decay, an idol will have from 9 Hit Dice (a featureless hunk of rock) to 18 Hit Dice (hardly affected by the ravages of time).</p><p>Living idols exist for one purpose and that is to be worshipped as a deity in their own right. They draw power from the number of sacrifices made in their honor and can perform a potentially beneficial side effect in return for a weekly sacrifice. The nature of the beneficial power and sacrifice varies, however; the idols with the most beneficial powers require the most costly sacrifices.</p><p>All living idols can communicate using empathy. They make it immediately clear to worshippers whether or not they find a particular sacrifice pleasing and appropriate.</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Combat:</b> While not entirely sentient, all living idols are imbued with a strong instinct for self-preservation and have several powerful mechanisms to help insure their survival.</p><p>Living idols are immune to any weapon of less than a +3 or better enchantment. Most spells have absolutely no effect on a living idol, with the following exceptions: <i>rock to mud</i> inflicts 6-36 points of damage (the idol is entitled a save for half damage); the reverse of the spell, <i>mud to rock</i>, restores 6-36 points of damage and may (50% chance) regenerate a lost limb, provided one is missing; <i>stone to flesh</i> makes the idol vulnerable to any normal attack or damage-inflicting spell for a single round; <i>disintegrate</i> inflicts 10-100 points of damage on the idol (no save).</p><p>All living idols must consume at least one sacrifice a week in order to be satisfied. So long as the weekly sacrifice is maintained, the powerful magic of these enchanted statues has a side effect on the surrounding area unique to each individual living statue. In addition to the weekly sacrifice, another is required in order for the idol to perform its major power (see the sample idols below for examples).</p><p>Living idols can also <i>charm</i> creatures that approach nearby, although the manner in which the enchantment is administered may vary (see the sample idols section below). If the idol is attended by a cult and has been nourished by frequent sacrifices, targets of the <i>charm</i> receive a -4 penalty on their saves (in addition to any penalties described below).</p><p>Finally, if physically threatened, living idols can physically attack if they possess at least one appendage. They can deliver a crushing blow each round with their stony fist or claw, inflicting 4-32 points of damage. Living idols fight as automatons, with little strategy beyond eliminating any opponents capable of harming them.</p><h2>Sample idols and their cults</h2><p class=\"f\">Long-forgotten, ancient religions are thought to be responsible for the creation of living idols. Now these religions are reduced to small cults, existing only because of the idols. ability to charm passers-by.</p><p>In the most general of terms, cults are known to worship either animals, death, elemental forces, or healing. The DM should feel free to create personalized cults for his campaign.</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Animal Cults</b></p>  <p class=\"ni\">These cults are centered around an animal-shaped living idol, usually a common pest or vermin, such as the <a href=\"/appendix/rat\">rat</a> or <a href=\"/appendix/scorpion\">scorpion</a>. The alignment of these idols is strictly lawful neutral, and they typically charm any creature who approaches within 100', compelling the being to join in its worship. These idols require a small and slightly valuable sacrifice of gold, gems, or jewelry (usually of no more than 25 gp value).</p><p>The side effect is an <i>aura of protection</i> against the type of animal depicted by the idol; for instance, a scorpion idol radiates a <i>protection from scorpions aura</i> in up to a one-mile radius. The major power also relates to the type of animal depicted by the idol; for instance, a rat idol will <i>cure disease</i>. Living animal idols cannot perform their major power more than once per day.</p><p>These are perhaps the most common of living idols, fostering small- to medium-sized cults of 20-200 worshipers. They are strictly a local phenomena, at most the hushed secret of a small, desert village. Since the idol.s charmed worshippers accurately believe that the idol is protecting them from a particular type of animal or vermin, they will protect the idol at every opportunity and violently oppose any who seek to destroy it. The major power of the idol is thought to be a sacred boon to the village or congregation, not to be shared with outsiders or nonbelievers.</p><p></p><p class=\"f\"><b>Death Cults</b></p>  <p class=\"ni\">These cults are centered around a horrible and grotesque idol, usually in the form of a man-eating monster (a <a href=\"/appendix/ghulgrea\">great ghul</a> or <a href=\"/appendix/silat\">silat</a>) or undead <a href=\"/appendix/skeleton\">skeleton</a>. The alignment of these idols is neutral evil. They only <i>charm</i> creatures that physically touch them, although the mind control exerted by these idols is extremely strong (save at -4). Charmed beings will serve the idol and seek out human and demihuman victims to add to the cult. At least once per week, an outsider will be sacrificed to the idol. A lowranking member of the cult may be sacrificed instead.</p><p>The side effect of joining the cult is that all members cease aging for as long as the idol is satisfied. The major power of these idols is to endow the cult &ldquo;priest&rdquo; with the ability to cast a powerful necromantic spell once per week (either <i>resurrection</i>, <i>regeneration</i>, or <i>restoration</i>, or their reverse). Typically, a death cult's &ldquo;priest&rdquo; will be the highest-ranking cult member and is not necessarily a cleric.</p><p>The death cults are universally hated and feared by civilized Zakharans. Organized religions and local rulers seek to stamp them out whenever they surface. As a result, these cults are now restricted to the wilderness of Zakhara, where the cults can operate with impunity, gathering victims through planned raids on caravans, isolated villages, and wandering tribes. Large, established death cults (200-500 + members) tend to attract sentient undead, especially <a href=\"/appendix/vampire\">vampires</a>. These quickly rise to the &ldquo;priest&rdquo; position within the cult and use cult members to feed their own, and the idol's, appetites.</p><p></p><p class=\"f\"><b>Elemental Cults</b></p>  <p class=\"ni\">These cults are centered around a living idol crafted in the shape of a faceless man. The alignment of these idols is chaotic neutral. Using their empathic ability to screen the emotions of all creatures who approach within 30', these idols will attempt to <i>charm</i> (save at -2) only those beings fostering an intent to harm or destroy them. The substance of the sacrifice (100 gp value) and the idol's protective side effect (which covers the area in a one-mile radius surrounding the statue) depends on the element represented by the idol.</p><p>#t Element|Sacrifice|Aura of protection from:#Earth|Gems|Earthquakes#Fire|Rare woods|Uncontrolled fires#Water|Aromatic oils|Tidal waves and flooding#Air|Exotic perfumes|Whirlwinds and sandstorms</p><p>The major power of these statues is to summon a 12 HD <a href=\"/appendix/elementa\">elemental</a> of the appropriate type from the inner planes, one per week, to perform a specific task for the individual who made the sacrifice. (There is no chance of the summoned elemental turning on the summoner.) See also the <a href=\"/appendix/eleathas\">Elemental, Athas</a> entry.</p><p>These types of living idols do not generate <i>charmed</i> cults, but are catalysts for chaos in the society around them. Desert sheiks, for instance, have been known to fight over a particular elemental idol for generations. Elemental wizards are drawn to these idols like iron filings to a magnet, seeking to destroy them. (They are interested in keeping a monopoly on controlling the elements; these idols are a threat to that goal.)</p><p></p><p class=\"f\"><b>Healing Cults</b></p>  <p class=\"ni\">These cults seek to promote healing and growth. The idols themselves are neutral good, representing a kind, gentle figure; statues of young girls and old men are the most common. Like the elemental idols, these will only attempt to <i>charm</i> (save at -2) those beings fostering harmful or destructive intentions. These idols thrive on a sacrifice of beauty, praise, and thanksgiving, feeding on the positive energy generated in worship.</p><p>As a side effect, these statues radiate <i>protection from evil</i> in a 100' radius. The maiden statues are known to <i>heal</i>, while the old men statues can <i>control weather</i>. (Usually this power is used to summon rain in times of drought.) A living idol of this type can perform its major ability once per day.</p><p></p><p class=\"f\"><br></p><p class=\"f\"><b>Ecology:</b> Living idols have no function or role on Zakharan society and ecology outside the cults and social disruption they often inspire. Living idols are considered savage and unenlightened by most Zakharans. Even the kahin, who draw their power from the oldest of idol-worshipping faiths, usually consider worshipping a living idol anachronistic or outmoded. Almost all modern religions despise living idols for their mind-controlling ability, which is antithetical to most organized religions in Zakhara. Moralist and ethoist priests will seek to destroy the idols at every opportunity, though a pragmatic priest might see the benefits of the healing idols.</p><p>Although many priests like to foster the image that living idols are very rare, nomads tell a completely different story. The nomads sometimes discover them in abandoned ruins, recently uncovered by a sandstorm. Most believe many more living idols are still buried beneath the desert's shifting sands.</p>\n","images":["<img src=\"grf/aq.gif\" width=\"150\" height=\"75\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Al-Qadim (Forgotten Realms)\" title=\"Al-Qadim (Forgotten Realms)\" align=\"right\">","<img src=\"img/liviidol.gif\" alt=\"Living Idol\" title=\"Living Idol\" border=\"0\" width=\"300\" height=\"360\" style=\"text-align:right;\" align=\"right\">","<img src=\"grf/add2_01.gif\" width=\"200\" height=\"56\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Advanced Dungeons & Dragons 2nd Edition\">"],"setting":"Al-Qadim (Forgotten Realms)","statblock":{"Animal":{"Activity Cycle":"Any","Alignment":"Lawful neutral","Armor Class":"4","Climate/Terrain":"Any","Damage/Attack":"4-32","Diet":"Sacrifices","Frequency":"Very rare","Hit Dice":"9","Intelligence":"Semi (2-4)","Magic Resistance":"Nil","Morale":"Fearless (20)","Movement":"6","No. Appearing":"1","No. of Attacks":"1","Organization":"Solitary","Size":"L (10-12' tall)","Special Attacks":"Charm","Special Defenses":"Immune to most spells, +3 or better weapon to hit","THAC0":"3","Treasure":"Incidental","XP Value":"9,000"},"Death":{"Activity Cycle":"Any","Alignment":"Neutral Evil","Armor Class":"4","Climate/Terrain":"Any","Damage/Attack":"4-32","Diet":"Sacrifices","Frequency":"Very rare","Hit Dice":"16","Intelligence":"Semi (2-4)","Magic Resistance":"Nil","Morale":"Fearless (20)","Movement":"3","No. Appearing":"1","No. of Attacks":"1","Organization":"Solitary","Size":"L (10-12' tall)","Special Attacks":"Charm","Special Defenses":"Immune to most spells, +3 or better weapon to hit","THAC0":"3","Treasure":"Incidental","XP Value":"16,000"},"Elemental":{"Activity Cycle":"Any","Alignment":"Chaotic neutral","Armor Class":"Nil","Climate/Terrain":"Any","Damage/Attack":"4-32","Diet":"Sacrifices","Frequency":"Very rare","Hit Dice":"12","Intelligence":"Semi (2-4)","Magic Resistance":"Nil","Morale":"Fearless (20)","Movement":"4","No. Appearing":"1","No. of Attacks":"1","Organization":"Solitary","Size":"L (10-12' tall)","Special Attacks":"Charm","Special Defenses":"Immune to most spells, +3 or better weapon to hit","THAC0":"3","Treasure":"Incidental","XP Value":"12,000"},"Healing":{"Activity Cycle":"Any","Alignment":"Neutral good","Armor Class":"4","Climate/Terrain":"Any","Damage/Attack":"4-32","Diet":"Sacrifices","Frequency":"Very rare","Hit Dice":"12","Intelligence":"Semi (2-4)","Magic Resistance":"Nil","Morale":"Fearless (20)","Movement":"3","No. Appearing":"1","No. of Attacks":"1","Organization":"Solitary","Size":"L (10-12' tall)","Special Attacks":"Charm","Special Defenses":"Immune to most spells, +3 or better weapon to hit","THAC0":"3","Treasure":"Incidental","XP Value":"12,000"}},"title":"Living Idol"},"sources":["2129"],"statblock_names":[],"title":"Living Idol","prev_key":"livihair","next_key":"livistee","monster_path":"/appendix/liviidol"}},"staticQueryHashes":[],"slicesMap":{}}
