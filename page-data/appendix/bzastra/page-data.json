While the powers listed above are the most common, some aarakocra have different or additional powers.</p><p class=\"f\">A race of intelligent, birdlike creatures living in the deepest deserts of Athas, the rare Athasian <a href=\"/appendix/aarakocr\">aarakocra</a> spends its time soaring on thermals in search of food.</p><p>The aarakocra is 7 to 8 feet tall with a wingspan of 20 feet or more. Because of its large wingspan, an aarakocra can carry as much as 75% of its own body weight and still fly easily. An aarakocra can fly a short distance carrying a burden equaling 125% of its own body weight. The average body weight of a full grown male is 100 pounds and a female is 85 pounds.</p><p>Each wing has a &ldquo;hand&rdquo; at its midpoint, consisting of three fingers and an opposable thumb. The fourth finger forms the rigid leading edge of the wing. In flight the hands cannot be used, but on the ground the aarakocra can use its hands almost as a human would. The aarakocra's body is protected by a thin bony plate on the chest, much like a solid rib cage. Talons on its legs can be used as claws and can be retracted to reveal a second set of hands, also with three fingers and an opposable thumb. Except for the chest plate, the entire skeleton is hollow and extremely fragile.</p><p>From a distance, the Athasian aarakocra resembles a huge <a href=\"/appendix/bird\">vulture</a>. Its black eyes, set in the front of the head, provide excellent vision over a long range. The plumage is generally black with a white collar for adult males and black or brown with a smaller white collar for females. Adolescents are a mixture of brown and black. The beak is large and covers most of the head. Plumage begins at the crown of the head and is darker near the head, except for the collar. Athasian aarakocra speak their own language and the languages of vultures and other large birds. Some speak the common tongue (5% to 10% chance depending on how deep in the wastelands a tribe lives).</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Combat:</b> Aarakocra can fight in the air or on the ground. They prefer aerial combat since their bones are too fragile to withstand a solid blow from a human-sized opponent. In combat against creatures on the ground, they prefer to fly over their victim and drop weighted nets. Some aarakocra use darts to harass ground-based opponents.</p><p>If their opponents can fly, the aarakocra generally forgo the use of the net, although large groups sometimes use nets on flying creatures. Normally, aarakocra attack flying creatures with long spears, diving from above and allowing the momentum to carry the spear through the target. Such an attack doubles the damage if the aarakocra have been able to dive at least 50 feet. Only the very largest aarakocra can carry more than one of these spears, they can attack with both at once with no penalty, causing double damage on each strike. All diving attacks are made at +4 and should be treated as a charge attack. All other penalties and restrictions of charge attacks apply.</p><p>The effect of the aarakocra's nets depends on if the opponent is flying at the time it becomes entangled. Creatures on the ground that are hit by a net are entangled and unable to participate in any combat until they make a successful Strength check to get free of the net. Flying creatures hit by a net can no longer fly and immediately begin falling. If they cannot escape the net or use some magical means to arrest the fall, normal falling damage applies.</p><p>Unless victims are entangled in nets, aarakocra are cautious in ground combat. If the aarakocra outnumber their opponents they advance in a straight line and thrust with their spears. If outnumbered, or the opponents are particularly tough, the aarakocra withdraw. Victims entangled in nets are killed or incapacitated for use as food or ransom.</p><p>Athasian aarakocra are mindful of their physical limitations as well as their comparatively low psionic abilities. They do not normally initiate psionic combat. At the first sign of psionic powers from any of their victims, however, all aarakocra that have some ability will use whatever attack and defense modes they can in an attempt to destroy the threat. Large groups of is or more aarakocra may initiate psionic combat if their leaders feel they can win quickly and avoid physical combat.</p><p>In desperation, an aarakocra can attempt to bite an opponent in combat. Because of the unwieldiness of its beak, the aarakocra has a THAC0 of 18 if attacking with this appendage. Further, the birdman causes only 1d2 points of damage with the beak.</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Habitat/Society:</b> Athasian aarakocra live in tribes with 6-20 (2d8+4) members, depending on the prestige of the leader. The largest tribe ever recorded had 50 members. The tribal hunting territory depends on the size of the tribe, usually about 500 square miles for a tribe of 10 members. There are no rigid boundaries between tribes and border disputes are not uncommon.</p><p>Alignments of tribe members are similar to the alignment of the leader. A tribe that has a leader who is neutral good may have neutral good, chaotic good, lawful good, and true neutral members. A predominantly evil tribe does not recognize boundaries with other tribes and treats other tribes as inferior beings to be eliminated.</p><p>Athasian aarakocra aren't happy in enclosed spaces, but they they take refuge in a cave or building if necessary.</p><p>Nonevil tribes live in rocky aeries in the highest peaks they can find. Evil tribes are normally nomadic and use an aerie made by another tribe if they need to remain in an area for a long time, even if they have to evict the tribe that made the nest.</p><p>Aarakocra aren't friendly toward intruders in their territory, especially caravans. They try to extract a toll from the caravan for passage through the desert. Good-aligned tribes allow unhindered passage of caravans that pay a tribute. If someone refuses to pay the tribute, the aarakocra try to capture scouts or outriders from the party and hold them until an even larger tribute is paid. The payment may be either livestock or shiny objects. Aarakocra are smart enough not to be taken in by glass baubles instead of gems, although they cannot tell the difference between the more common gems and the rare ones.</p><p>Evil tribes ask for tribute and often attack a caravan whether it pays or not. Aarakocra always demand shiny objects such as stones. These tribes find humans and demihumans to be quite tasty and prefer them to other food.</p><p>Good-aligned tribes of aarakocra sometimes return a lost traveler to the edge of the desert after first removing any valuables the traveler may be carrying. On very rare occasions a tribe might return a lost group of travelers to the more frequently traveled parts of the desert, again after first taking any valuables as payment.</p><p>The oldest male is the leader of the tribal hunting party and has 4+4 Hit Dice. The oldest female is in charge of the tribal aerie and has 3+3 HD. In tribes that have more than 15 members, the next oldest aarakocra serves as shaman and has 3+3 HD; the shaman completes the triumvirate necessary for proper worship and the summoning of elementals. (Interestingly, no magic-using aarakocra has ever been recorded.) Tribes without a shaman cannot summon <a href=\"/appendix/element1\">air elementals</a>, which is an important part of aarakocra culture.</p><p>The shaman is the leader of the daily sun worship. Aarakocra worship the sun because it provides them with the thermals they need to soar in search of food. The shaman also leads the mystic rituals used to summon an air elemental. Summoning an air elemental is usually done only in preparation for the tribe's most sacred ceremony, the hunt. Small tribes must band together for this ceremony to allow the triumvirate to be formed.</p><p>The ceremony to summon an air elemental must be conducted at dawn and requires the oldest male and female to emit a highpitched keening whistle. The shaman conducts an intricate dance around them, simultaneously chanting an ancient summoning mantra.</p><p>The hunt is the final part of the initiation of adolescent aarakocra to adulthood and often takes the tribe far from their normal teritory. The target is always a <a href=\"/appendix/drakalsi\">silt drake</a>. The hunt is the only time the females leave the relative safety of the nest. Even an evil tribe will not interfere with a tribe on a hunt. An air elemental is often summoned to help find the drake, but never takes part in the actual combat. Although the adult members of the tribe take part in the initial phases of the combat, it is the initiates who deliver the final, killing blows to me drake. Scars from the hunt are considered a mark of pride among all aarakocra.</p><p>The females spend about eight months of the year incubating their eggs. Athasian aarakocra mate for life and a pair normally produces as many as 10 offspring. A female lays one egg a year. Constant incubation is not required because of the high daytime temperatures, so the females can maintain the nest and keep the tribe's treasure in order.</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Ecology:</b> Athasian aarakocra are high on the food chain and have no natural enemies other than <a href=\"/appendix/drakatha\">drakes</a>. Unless evil, aarakocra leave their own territory only to hunt the silt drake and return as soon as possible when the hunt is over. (Evil aarakocra attack others, as noted above.) Aarakocra eggs and hatchlings are sought after by wealthy land owners who wish to use the creatures as scouts and sentries. An egg can bring as much as 10 cp in Tyr's marketplace. Tribes that have had eggs or hatchlings stolen have long memories and sometimes take revenge against the thief at a later date. Captive aarakocra join any tribe they come in contact with.</p><p>Athasian aarakocra have a natural life span of 21-30 years.</p>\n","images":["<img src=\"grf/ds.gif\" width=\"150\" height=\"75\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Dark Sun\" title=\"Dark Sun\" align=\"right\">","<img src=\"img/aarakath.gif\" alt=\"Aarakocra (Athas)\" title=\"Aarakocra (Athas)\" border=\"0\" width=\"300\" height=\"360\" style=\"text-align:right;\" align=\"right\">","<img src=\"grf/add2_01.gif\" width=\"200\" height=\"56\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Advanced Dungeons & Dragons 2nd Edition\">"],"setting":"Dark Sun","statblock":{"Aarakocra (Athas)":{"Activity Cycle":"Day","Alignment":"Any","Armor Class":"7","Climate/Terrain":"Deep desert","Damage/Attack":"1d3/1d3 or by weapon","Diet":"Carnivore","Frequency":"Rare","Hit Dice":"2+2","Intelligence":"Average (8-10)","Magic Resistance":"Nil","Morale":"Steady (11)","Movement":"6, Fl 36 (C)","No. Appearing":"1d10","No. of Attacks":"2","Organization":"Tribal","Size":"M (20'+ wingspan)","Special Attacks":"Nil","Special Defenses":"Nil","THAC0":"17","Treasure":"Varies","XP Value":"65"}},"title":"Aarakocra (Athas)"},"sources":["2433"],"statblock_names":[],"title":"Aarakocra (Athas)","prev_key":"zygraat","next_key":"aarakocr","monster_path":"/appendix/aarakath"}}},"pageContext":{"monster_key":"bzastra","monster_data":{"TSR":["2635"],"fullBody":"  <table cellspacing=\"0\" cellpadding=\"0\"><tr><th>Climate/Terrain:</th><td>Elemental Plane of Water</td></tr><tr><th>Frequency:</th><td>Very rare</td></tr><tr><th>Organization:</th><td>Varies</td></tr><tr><th>Activity Cycle:</th><td>Any</td></tr><tr><th>Diet:</th><td>Omnivore</td></tr><tr><th>Intelligence:</th><td>Average to genius (10-18)</td></tr><tr><th>Treasure:</th><td>V</td></tr><tr><th>Alignment:</th><td>Neutral (rarely, any)</td></tr><tr><th>No. Appearing:</th><td>1d6</td></tr><tr><th>Armor Class:</th><td>6 (or 0)</td></tr><tr><th>Movement:</th><td>Sw 9</td></tr><tr><th>Hit Dice:</th><td>5</td></tr><tr><th>THAC0:</th><td>15</td></tr><tr><th>No. of Attacks:</th><td>1</td></tr><tr><th>Damage/Attack:</th><td>2d6</td></tr><tr><th>Special Attacks:</th><td>Telekinesis</td></tr><tr><th>Special Defenses:</th><td>Telekinesis</td></tr><tr><th>Magic Resistance:</th><td>Nil</td></tr><tr><th>Size:</th><td>M (5' tall)</td></tr><tr><th>Morale:</th><td>Steady (11-12)</td></tr><tr><th>XP Value:</th><td>650</td></tr></table><p class=\"f\"><i>From the notebooks of Ctan Ftau:</i></p><p class=\"ni\">What strange life is spawned on the endless planes, where all things are surely possible, given enough time? Indeed, infinite time and infinite space means infinite potential, and the proof is all around us, on each plane of our multiverse.</p><p>Take, for example, the case of the bzastra. Most folks don't know of this creature of the Elemental Plane of Water, for it is both rare and reclusive. Nonetheless, it's the product of strange chance and random possibility.</p><p>As near as anyone can determine, there were once small creatures on Water that appeared to be rings of coral but were actually beasts of scaly flesh. These unintelligent, unobtrusive animals fed on the rich kelp beds of the plane.</p><p>Then, at some point (probably long ago), chance stepped in. A few of these ring creatures came upon a waterborne plant called a blue waterwhip - a bit of aquatic flora that seemed no different from the millions of other simple seaweeds thriving in the Endless Ocean. No one knew, however, that the blue waterwhip gave off a low-frequency aura of energy, invisible in all spectrums. Somehow, this energy interacted with the chemical nature of the ring creatures, bringing them together - linking them in a heretofore unknown way. On that day, the first bzastra was born.</p><p> </p><p class=\"ni\">This intelligent creature is formed from the union of a blue waterwhip and three to six of the ring beasts. The rings stack horizontally atop one another, the plant's blue vine threaded in and out between them. The bzastra exists only in this symbiotic fusion. If separated, the rings and the waterwhip resume their simplistic, unintelligent existences.</p><p>Unemotional, logical creatures, bzastra have no real passions or goals other than survival. On rare occasions, however, an individual bzastra encounters someone or something that exerts a powerful influence and bends it to the cause of good or evil (or, even more rarely, law or chaos).</p><p>Despite the sheer impossibility of their existence, bzastra have formed a complex society of clever, free-thinking individuals. With their strange evolution came amazing powers that allowed them to communicate telepathically with any creature, protect themselves against the predators of their watery plane, and reach high above their meager beginnings.</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Combat:</b> The bzastra manipulates energy currents that run through the plane of Water. These subtle, invisible waves enable the creature to affect matter in a way that resembles a powerful and delicate telekinesis.</p><p>First and foremost, the creature can defend itself by lashing out with the energy, inflicting 2d6 points of damage per attack. Alternatively, a bzastra can immobilize a single creature as if it had cast a <i>hold person</i> or <i>hold monster</i> spell (though the victim can remain free if he succeeds at a saving throw versus paralyzation). Lastly, a bzastra can project the energy all around it, forming a kind of telekinetic shield that improves its Armor Class by 6 steps (giving it an AC of 0). However, the creature can do nothing else while using its power to maintain the shield.</p><p>In addition, a bzastra's energy-control abilities enable it to use the following spell-like powers once per round, at will: <i>animal growth</i>, <i>blink</i>, <i>ESP</i>, <i>plant growth</i>, <i>suggestion</i>, and <i>water breathing</i> (on others). Through telekinesis, a bzastra can also manipulate an object of up to 200 pounds with a high degree of dexterity. The creature can use each of these spell-like power independently of its above-mentioned offensive and defensive capabilities.</p><p>The energy given off by the waterwhip must be at least somewhat magical in nature, because a <i>dispel magic</i> spell renders a bzastra into its component parts: a few ring beasts and a strand of blue waterwhip. The spell causes no physical damage. No one's found any other method of separating the parts of the creature without killing it in the process.</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Habitat/Society:</b> Scholars assume that when the first bzastra was created by accidental contact between the ring creatures and the blue waterwhip, it used its newfound intelligence and powers to maneuver other rings and waterwhips together, thus forming more of its kind. Indeed, bzastra occasionally refer to a &ldquo;time mover&rdquo;, and it's thought that it is this first individual to which they refer.</p><p>Bzastra construct homes for themselves out of water plants, most frequently relying on none other than the blue waterwhip. Their globelike lairs consist of vines woven together and provide only privacy, not protection. More than just homes, however, the constructs ride the currents of the plane of Water, carrying the bzastra inside safely along. Each creature builds a separate lair, though at times a group of them may link their individual dwellings together with vine tethers.</p><p>Whether alone or in a community, bzastra prize private contemplation. Many spend weeks and months in quiet meditation, focusing on topics that outsiders can barely guess at. Given their apparently random evolutionary leap, some scholars believe that the bzastra contemplate the beauty of chance. Of course, the scholars who offer this theory are Xaositects, so a berk should take their &ldquo;wisdom&rdquo; with a grain of salt.</p><p>When active, bzastra spend their time building homes, feeding on microscopic life, and exploring their plane. Inquisitive and scholarly in their pursuits, they even record some of their findings on animal shells (using their telekinesis). Those who've tumbled to the creatures' written language are said to have learned a great many secrets about the Elemental Plane of Water.</p><p>Bzastra aren't likely to be hostile, but will defend themselves if attacked. They may also try to steal interesting objects from intelligent creatures that cross their path. Generally, they do this only to further their knowledge and satisfy their curiosity, though sometimes they may figure out how to operate a magical item they've obtained and use it for their own sake.</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Ecology:</b> Bzastra feed on microscopic or near-microscopic animals and plants like plankton and kelp. Although some bzastra are made of as few as three ring beasts or as many as six, any differences that this might cause or reflect remain a mystery.</p><p>Chant has it, however, that the bzastra gather all the ring creatures they can find and secrete them away. They keep the rings safe and sound like children, occasionally forcing evolution on them through the introduction of a blue waterwhip. This speculation is probably true, since no one has ever actually seen one of the mysterious ring crealures on its own in the wild. Blue waterwhip, on the other hand, thrives throughout the Elemental Plane of Water, though it exhibits no known effects on any other creatures.</p>\n","images":["<img src=\"grf/ps.gif\" width=\"150\" height=\"75\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Planescape\" title=\"Planescape\" align=\"right\">","<img src=\"img/bzastra.gif\" alt=\"Bzastra\" title=\"Bzastra\" border=\"0\" width=\"300\" height=\"360\" style=\"text-align:right;\" align=\"right\">","<img src=\"grf/add2_01.gif\" width=\"200\" height=\"56\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Advanced Dungeons & Dragons 2nd Edition\">"],"setting":"Planescape","statblock":{"Bzastra":{"Activity Cycle":"Any","Alignment":"Neutral (rarely, any)","Armor Class":"6 (or 0)","Climate/Terrain":"Elemental Plane of Water","Damage/Attack":"2d6","Diet":"Omnivore","Frequency":"Very rare","Hit Dice":"5","Intelligence":"Average to genius (10-18)","Magic Resistance":"Nil","Morale":"Steady (11-12)","Movement":"Sw 9","No. Appearing":"1d6","No. of Attacks":"1","Organization":"Varies","Size":"M (5' tall)","Special Attacks":"Telekinesis","Special Defenses":"Telekinesis","THAC0":"15","Treasure":"V","XP Value":"650"}},"title":"Bzastra"},"sources":["2635"],"statblock_names":[],"title":"Bzastra","prev_key":"byut","next_key":"cabhaigh","monster_path":"/appendix/bzastra"}},"staticQueryHashes":[],"slicesMap":{}}
