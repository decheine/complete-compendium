While the powers listed above are the most common, some aarakocra have different or additional powers.</p><p class=\"f\">A race of intelligent, birdlike creatures living in the deepest deserts of Athas, the rare Athasian <a href=\"/appendix/aarakocr\">aarakocra</a> spends its time soaring on thermals in search of food.</p><p>The aarakocra is 7 to 8 feet tall with a wingspan of 20 feet or more. Because of its large wingspan, an aarakocra can carry as much as 75% of its own body weight and still fly easily. An aarakocra can fly a short distance carrying a burden equaling 125% of its own body weight. The average body weight of a full grown male is 100 pounds and a female is 85 pounds.</p><p>Each wing has a &ldquo;hand&rdquo; at its midpoint, consisting of three fingers and an opposable thumb. The fourth finger forms the rigid leading edge of the wing. In flight the hands cannot be used, but on the ground the aarakocra can use its hands almost as a human would. The aarakocra's body is protected by a thin bony plate on the chest, much like a solid rib cage. Talons on its legs can be used as claws and can be retracted to reveal a second set of hands, also with three fingers and an opposable thumb. Except for the chest plate, the entire skeleton is hollow and extremely fragile.</p><p>From a distance, the Athasian aarakocra resembles a huge <a href=\"/appendix/bird\">vulture</a>. Its black eyes, set in the front of the head, provide excellent vision over a long range. The plumage is generally black with a white collar for adult males and black or brown with a smaller white collar for females. Adolescents are a mixture of brown and black. The beak is large and covers most of the head. Plumage begins at the crown of the head and is darker near the head, except for the collar. Athasian aarakocra speak their own language and the languages of vultures and other large birds. Some speak the common tongue (5% to 10% chance depending on how deep in the wastelands a tribe lives).</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Combat:</b> Aarakocra can fight in the air or on the ground. They prefer aerial combat since their bones are too fragile to withstand a solid blow from a human-sized opponent. In combat against creatures on the ground, they prefer to fly over their victim and drop weighted nets. Some aarakocra use darts to harass ground-based opponents.</p><p>If their opponents can fly, the aarakocra generally forgo the use of the net, although large groups sometimes use nets on flying creatures. Normally, aarakocra attack flying creatures with long spears, diving from above and allowing the momentum to carry the spear through the target. Such an attack doubles the damage if the aarakocra have been able to dive at least 50 feet. Only the very largest aarakocra can carry more than one of these spears, they can attack with both at once with no penalty, causing double damage on each strike. All diving attacks are made at +4 and should be treated as a charge attack. All other penalties and restrictions of charge attacks apply.</p><p>The effect of the aarakocra's nets depends on if the opponent is flying at the time it becomes entangled. Creatures on the ground that are hit by a net are entangled and unable to participate in any combat until they make a successful Strength check to get free of the net. Flying creatures hit by a net can no longer fly and immediately begin falling. If they cannot escape the net or use some magical means to arrest the fall, normal falling damage applies.</p><p>Unless victims are entangled in nets, aarakocra are cautious in ground combat. If the aarakocra outnumber their opponents they advance in a straight line and thrust with their spears. If outnumbered, or the opponents are particularly tough, the aarakocra withdraw. Victims entangled in nets are killed or incapacitated for use as food or ransom.</p><p>Athasian aarakocra are mindful of their physical limitations as well as their comparatively low psionic abilities. They do not normally initiate psionic combat. At the first sign of psionic powers from any of their victims, however, all aarakocra that have some ability will use whatever attack and defense modes they can in an attempt to destroy the threat. Large groups of is or more aarakocra may initiate psionic combat if their leaders feel they can win quickly and avoid physical combat.</p><p>In desperation, an aarakocra can attempt to bite an opponent in combat. Because of the unwieldiness of its beak, the aarakocra has a THAC0 of 18 if attacking with this appendage. Further, the birdman causes only 1d2 points of damage with the beak.</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Habitat/Society:</b> Athasian aarakocra live in tribes with 6-20 (2d8+4) members, depending on the prestige of the leader. The largest tribe ever recorded had 50 members. The tribal hunting territory depends on the size of the tribe, usually about 500 square miles for a tribe of 10 members. There are no rigid boundaries between tribes and border disputes are not uncommon.</p><p>Alignments of tribe members are similar to the alignment of the leader. A tribe that has a leader who is neutral good may have neutral good, chaotic good, lawful good, and true neutral members. A predominantly evil tribe does not recognize boundaries with other tribes and treats other tribes as inferior beings to be eliminated.</p><p>Athasian aarakocra aren't happy in enclosed spaces, but they they take refuge in a cave or building if necessary.</p><p>Nonevil tribes live in rocky aeries in the highest peaks they can find. Evil tribes are normally nomadic and use an aerie made by another tribe if they need to remain in an area for a long time, even if they have to evict the tribe that made the nest.</p><p>Aarakocra aren't friendly toward intruders in their territory, especially caravans. They try to extract a toll from the caravan for passage through the desert. Good-aligned tribes allow unhindered passage of caravans that pay a tribute. If someone refuses to pay the tribute, the aarakocra try to capture scouts or outriders from the party and hold them until an even larger tribute is paid. The payment may be either livestock or shiny objects. Aarakocra are smart enough not to be taken in by glass baubles instead of gems, although they cannot tell the difference between the more common gems and the rare ones.</p><p>Evil tribes ask for tribute and often attack a caravan whether it pays or not. Aarakocra always demand shiny objects such as stones. These tribes find humans and demihumans to be quite tasty and prefer them to other food.</p><p>Good-aligned tribes of aarakocra sometimes return a lost traveler to the edge of the desert after first removing any valuables the traveler may be carrying. On very rare occasions a tribe might return a lost group of travelers to the more frequently traveled parts of the desert, again after first taking any valuables as payment.</p><p>The oldest male is the leader of the tribal hunting party and has 4+4 Hit Dice. The oldest female is in charge of the tribal aerie and has 3+3 HD. In tribes that have more than 15 members, the next oldest aarakocra serves as shaman and has 3+3 HD; the shaman completes the triumvirate necessary for proper worship and the summoning of elementals. (Interestingly, no magic-using aarakocra has ever been recorded.) Tribes without a shaman cannot summon <a href=\"/appendix/element1\">air elementals</a>, which is an important part of aarakocra culture.</p><p>The shaman is the leader of the daily sun worship. Aarakocra worship the sun because it provides them with the thermals they need to soar in search of food. The shaman also leads the mystic rituals used to summon an air elemental. Summoning an air elemental is usually done only in preparation for the tribe's most sacred ceremony, the hunt. Small tribes must band together for this ceremony to allow the triumvirate to be formed.</p><p>The ceremony to summon an air elemental must be conducted at dawn and requires the oldest male and female to emit a highpitched keening whistle. The shaman conducts an intricate dance around them, simultaneously chanting an ancient summoning mantra.</p><p>The hunt is the final part of the initiation of adolescent aarakocra to adulthood and often takes the tribe far from their normal teritory. The target is always a <a href=\"/appendix/drakalsi\">silt drake</a>. The hunt is the only time the females leave the relative safety of the nest. Even an evil tribe will not interfere with a tribe on a hunt. An air elemental is often summoned to help find the drake, but never takes part in the actual combat. Although the adult members of the tribe take part in the initial phases of the combat, it is the initiates who deliver the final, killing blows to me drake. Scars from the hunt are considered a mark of pride among all aarakocra.</p><p>The females spend about eight months of the year incubating their eggs. Athasian aarakocra mate for life and a pair normally produces as many as 10 offspring. A female lays one egg a year. Constant incubation is not required because of the high daytime temperatures, so the females can maintain the nest and keep the tribe's treasure in order.</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Ecology:</b> Athasian aarakocra are high on the food chain and have no natural enemies other than <a href=\"/appendix/drakatha\">drakes</a>. Unless evil, aarakocra leave their own territory only to hunt the silt drake and return as soon as possible when the hunt is over. (Evil aarakocra attack others, as noted above.) Aarakocra eggs and hatchlings are sought after by wealthy land owners who wish to use the creatures as scouts and sentries. An egg can bring as much as 10 cp in Tyr's marketplace. Tribes that have had eggs or hatchlings stolen have long memories and sometimes take revenge against the thief at a later date. Captive aarakocra join any tribe they come in contact with.</p><p>Athasian aarakocra have a natural life span of 21-30 years.</p>\n","images":["<img src=\"grf/ds.gif\" width=\"150\" height=\"75\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Dark Sun\" title=\"Dark Sun\" align=\"right\">","<img src=\"img/aarakath.gif\" alt=\"Aarakocra (Athas)\" title=\"Aarakocra (Athas)\" border=\"0\" width=\"300\" height=\"360\" style=\"text-align:right;\" align=\"right\">","<img src=\"grf/add2_01.gif\" width=\"200\" height=\"56\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Advanced Dungeons & Dragons 2nd Edition\">"],"setting":"Dark Sun","statblock":{"Aarakocra (Athas)":{"Activity Cycle":"Day","Alignment":"Any","Armor Class":"7","Climate/Terrain":"Deep desert","Damage/Attack":"1d3/1d3 or by weapon","Diet":"Carnivore","Frequency":"Rare","Hit Dice":"2+2","Intelligence":"Average (8-10)","Magic Resistance":"Nil","Morale":"Steady (11)","Movement":"6, Fl 36 (C)","No. Appearing":"1d10","No. of Attacks":"2","Organization":"Tribal","Size":"M (20'+ wingspan)","Special Attacks":"Nil","Special Defenses":"Nil","THAC0":"17","Treasure":"Varies","XP Value":"65"}},"title":"Aarakocra (Athas)"},"sources":["2433"],"statblock_names":[],"title":"Aarakocra (Athas)","prev_key":"zygraat","next_key":"aarakocr","monster_path":"/appendix/aarakath"}}},"pageContext":{"monster_key":"fungus","monster_data":{"TSR":["2140","2103"],"fullBody":"  <table cellspacing=\"0\" cellpadding=\"0\"><tr class=\"bk\"><th> </th><th class=\"cn\">Violet</th><th class=\"cn\">Shrieker</th><th class=\"cn\">Phycomid</th><th class=\"cn\">Ascomoid</th><th class=\"cn\">Gas spore</th></tr><tr><th>Climate/Terrain:</th><td>Subterranean</td><td>Subterranean</td><td>Subterranean</td><td>Subterranean</td><td>Subterranean</td></tr><tr><th>Frequency:</th><td>Rare</td><td>Common</td><td>Rare</td><td>Very rare</td><td>Rare</td></tr><tr><th>Organization:</th><td>Multicellular</td><td>Multicellular</td><td>Multicellular</td><td>Multicellular</td><td>Multicellular</td></tr><tr><th>Activity Cycle:</th><td>Any</td><td>Any</td><td>Any</td><td>Any</td><td>Any</td></tr><tr><th>Diet:</th><td>Scavenger</td><td>Scavenger</td><td>Scavenger</td><td>Scavenger</td><td>Scavenger</td></tr><tr><th>Intelligence:</th><td>Non- (0)</td><td>Non- (0)</td><td>Unratable</td><td>Unratable</td><td>Non- (0)</td></tr><tr><th>Treasure:</th><td>Nil</td><td>Nil</td><td>Nil</td><td>Nil</td><td>Nil</td></tr><tr><th>Alignment:</th><td>Neutral</td><td>Neutral</td><td>Neutral (evil)</td><td>Neutral (evil)</td><td>Neutral</td></tr><tr><th>No. Appearing:</th><td>1-4</td><td>2-8 (2d4)</td><td>1-4</td><td>1</td><td>1-3</td></tr><tr><th>Armor Class:</th><td>7</td><td>7</td><td>5</td><td>3</td><td>9</td></tr><tr><th>Movement:</th><td>1</td><td>1</td><td>3</td><td>12 (see below)</td><td>3</td></tr><tr><th>Hit Dice:</th><td>3</td><td>3</td><td>5</td><td>6+6</td><td>1 hp</td></tr><tr><th>THAC0:</th><td>17</td><td>17</td><td>15</td><td>13</td><td>N/A</td></tr><tr><th>No. of Attacks:</th><td>1-4</td><td>0</td><td>2</td><td>1</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><th>Damage/Attack:</th><td>See below</td><td>Nil</td><td>3-6/3-6</td><td>See below</td><td>See below</td></tr><tr><th>Special Attacks:</th><td>See below</td><td>Nil</td><td>Infection</td><td>Spore jet</td><td>See below</td></tr><tr><th>Special Defenses:</th><td>Nil</td><td>Noise</td><td>See below</td><td>See below</td><td>Nil</td></tr><tr><th>Magic Resistance:</th><td>Nil</td><td>Nil</td><td>Nil</td><td>Nil</td><td>Nil</td></tr><tr><th>Size:</th><td>M (4-7')</td><td>M (4-7')</td><td>T (2' dia.)</td><td>M to L (5-10' dia.)</td><td>M (4-6' dia.)</td></tr><tr><th>Morale:</th><td>Steady (12)</td><td>Steady (12)</td><td>Elite (14)</td><td>Champion (15)</td><td>Average (8)</td></tr><tr><th>XP Value:</th><td>175</td><td>120</td><td>650</td><td>1,400</td><td>120</td></tr></table><p class=\"f\">Fungi are simple plants that lack chlorophyll, true stems, roots, and leaves. Fungi are incapable of photosynthesis and live as parasites or saprophytes.</p><h2>Ordinary Fungi</h2><p class=\"f\">Ordinary fungi are well known to man: molds, yeast, mildew, mushrooms, and puffballs. These plants include both useful and harmful varieties.</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Combat:</b> Ordinary fungi do not attack or defend themselves, but they are prolific and can spread where unwanted.</p><p>Adventurers who have lost rations to mold or clothing to mildew have had unpleasant encounters with fungi.</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Habitat/Society:</b> The bodies of most true fungi consist of slender cottony filaments. Anyone who wishes to see this for himself need only leave a damp piece of bread in a cupboard for a day or two. Examining the black mold on the bread with a magnifying glass will show off not only the filaments, but also the spore bodies at the top of these. The spores are what gives mold its color.</p><p>Most fungi reproduce asexually by cell division, budding, fragmentation, or spores. Those that reproduce sexually alternate a sexual generation (gametophyte) with a spore-producing (sporophyte) one. Fungi grow best in dark, damp environments, which they can find all too easily in a kitchen cupboard, backpack, or boot. A warm environment is preferred by some, such as yeasts and certain molds, but excessive heat kills fungi.</p><p>Proper storage and cleanliness can be used to avoid most ordinary fungi.</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Ecology:</b> Fungi break down organic matter, thus playing an important part in the nitrogen cycle by decomposing dead organisms into ammonia. Without the action of mushrooms and bracket fungi, soil renewal could not take place as readily as it does.</p><p>Fungi are also useful to man for many purposes. Yeasts are valuable as fermenting agents, raising bread and brewing wines, beers, and ales. Certain molds are important for cheese production. The color in blue cheese is a mold that has been encouraged to grow in this semisoft cheese.</p><p>Many fungi are edible, and connoisseurs consider some to be delicious. Pigs are used to hunt for truffles, an underground fungus that grows near tree roots and gives food a piquant flavor. No one has as yet managed to cultivate truffles -- an enterprising botanist could make a mint by learning to grow these.</p><p>Mushrooms, the fruiting body of another underground fungus, can sometimes be eaten, but can be so poisonous that the novice mushroom hunter is allowed but one mistake in picking. The mycelium producing a single mushroom might extend beneath the ground for several feet in any direction. Medicinally, green molds (such as penicillium) can be used as folk remedies for various bacterial infections.</p><p>An alchemist expert in the ways of fungi can produce a variety of useful substances from their action on various materials.</p><h2>Violet Fungus</h2><p class=\"f\">Violet fungus growths resemble shriekers, and are usually (75%) encountered with them. The latter are immune to the touch of violet fungi, and the two types of creatures complement each other's existence.</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Combat:</b> Violet fungi favor rotted animal matter to grow upon. Each fungus has one to four branches with which it flails out if any animal comes within range (see following). The excretion from these branches rots flesh in one round unless a successful saving throw vs. poison is rolled or a <i>cure disease</i> spell is used. The branch length of this fungi depends upon the fungi's size. Violet fungi range from four to seven feet tall, the smallest having one-foot-long branches, the five-foot-tall fungi having two-foot-long branches, and so on. Any sized growth can have up to four branches.</p><h2>Shrieker</h2><p class=\"f\">Shriekers are normally quiet, mindless fungi that are ambulatory. They are dangerous to dungeon explorers because of the hellish racket they make.</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Combat:</b> Light within 30 feet or movement within 10 feet causes a shrieker to emit a piercing shriek that lasts for 1-3 rounds. This noise has a 50% chance of attracting wandering monsters each round thereafter.</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Habitat/Society:</b> They live in dark places beneath the ground, often in the company of violet fungi. When the shriekers attract curious dungeon dwellers by their shrieking, the violet fungi are able to kill them with their branches, leaving plenty of organic matter for these saprophytic life forms to feed on.</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Ecology:</b> <a href=\"/appendix/worm\">Purple worms</a> and <a href=\"/appendix/shammoun\">shambling mounds</a> greatly prize shriekers as food, and don't seem to mind the noise while eating.</p><p>Shrieker spores are an important ingredient in <i>potions of plant control</i>.</p><h2>Phycomid</h2><p class=\"f\">The algae-like phycomids resemble fibrous blobs of decomposing, milk-colored matter with capped fungi growing out of them. They exude a highly alkaline substance (like lye) when attacking.</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Combat:</b> These fungoid monsters have sensory organs for heat, sound, and vibrations located in several clusters. When phycomids attack, they extrude a tube and discharge the alkaline fluid in small globules that have a range of 1d6+6 feet.</p><p>In addition to alkaline damage, the globs that these creatures discharge might also cause victims to serve as hosts for new phycomid growth. If a victim fails a saving throw vs. poison, the individual begins to sprout mushroom-like growths in the infected area. This occurs in 1d4+4 rounds and inflicts 1d4+4 points of damage. The growths then spread throughout the host body, killing it in 1d4+4 turns, and turning it into a new phycomid. A <i>cure disease</i> spell will stop the spread through the host.</p><h2>Ascomoid</h2><p class=\"f\">Ascomoids are huge, puffball-like fungi with very thick, leathery skin. They move by rolling.</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Combat:</b> At first, an ascomoid's movement is slow - 3 for the first round, 6 the next, then 9, then finally 12 - but they can keep it up for hours without tiring.</p><p>Ascomoids attack by rolling into or over opponents. Small- and medium-sized opponents are knocked down and must rise during the next round or remain prone.</p><p>The creature's surface is covered with numerous pocks which serve as sensory organs. Each pock can also emit a jet of spores to attack dangerous enemies. Large opponents or those who have inflicted damage upon the ascomoids are always attacked by spore jets. The stream of spores is about one foot in diameter and 30 feet long. Upon striking, the stream puffs into a cloud of variable diameter (five to 20 feet). The creatures under attack must roll a successful saving throw vs. poison or die from infection in their internal systems in 1d4 rounds. Even those who save are blinded and choked to such an extent that they require 1d4 rounds to recover and rejoin melee. Meanwhile, they are nearly helpless, and all attacks upon them gain a +4 bonus to attack rolls with no shield or Dexterity bonuses allowed.</p><p>Different types of weapons affect the ascomoid differently. Piercing weapons, such as spears, score double damage. Shorter stabbing weapons do damage as if against a small-sized opponent. Blunt weapons do not harm ascomoids; slashes and cuts from edged weapons cause only 1 point of damage. An ascomoid saves against magical attacks, such as <i>magic missiles</i>, <i>fireballs</i>, and lightning, with a +4 bonus to the saving throw; damage is only 50% of normal. (Cold-based attacks are at normal probabilities and damage.) As these fungi have no minds by ordinary standards, all spells affecting the brain (<i>charm</i>, <i>ESP</i>, etc.), unless specific to plants, are useless.</p><h2>Gas Spore</h2><p class=\"f\">At any distance greater than 10 feet, a gas spore is 90% likely to be mistaken for a <a href=\"/appendix/beholde1\">beholder</a>. Even at close ranges there is a 25% possibility that the creature is seen as a beholder, for a gas spore has a false central eye and rhizome growths atop it that strongly resemble the eye stalks of a beholder.</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Combat:</b> If the spore is struck for even 1 point of damage it explodes. Every creature within a 20-foot radius suffers 6d6 points of damage (3d6 if a saving throw vs. wands is successful).</p><p>If a gas spore makes contact with exposed flesh, the spore shoots tiny rhizomes into the living matter and grows through the victim's system within one round. The gas spore dies immediately. The victim must have a <i>cure disease</i> spell cast on him within 24 hours or die, sprouting 2d4 gas spores.</p>\n","images":["<img src=\"grf/xx.gif\" width=\"150\" height=\"75\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Advanced Dungeons & Dragons 2nd Edition\" title=\"Advanced Dungeons & Dragons 2nd Edition\" align=\"right\">","<img src=\"img/fungus.gif\" alt=\"Fungus\" title=\"Fungus\" border=\"0\" width=\"300\" height=\"360\" style=\"text-align:right;\" align=\"right\">","<img src=\"grf/tsr_sm.png\" width=\"56\" height=\"59\" border=\"0\" alt=\"TSR\">"],"setting":"Advanced Dungeons & Dragons 2nd Edition","statblock":{"Ascomoid":{"Activity Cycle":"Any","Alignment":"Neutral (evil)","Armor Class":"3","Climate/Terrain":"Subterranean","Damage/Attack":"See below","Diet":"Scavenger","Frequency":"Very rare","Hit Dice":"6+6","Intelligence":"Unratable","Magic Resistance":"Nil","Morale":"Champion (15)","Movement":"12 (see below)","No. Appearing":"1","No. of Attacks":"1","Organization":"Multicellular","Size":"M to L (5-10' dia.)","Special Attacks":"Spore jet","Special Defenses":"See below","THAC0":"13","Treasure":"Nil","XP Value":"1,400"},"Gas spore":{"Activity Cycle":"Any","Alignment":"Neutral","Armor Class":"9","Climate/Terrain":"Subterranean","Damage/Attack":"See below","Diet":"Scavenger","Frequency":"Rare","Hit Dice":"1 hp","Intelligence":"Non- (0)","Magic Resistance":"Nil","Morale":"Average (8)","Movement":"3","No. Appearing":"1-3","No. of Attacks":"1","Organization":"Multicellular","Size":"M (4-6' dia.)","Special Attacks":"See below","Special Defenses":"Nil","THAC0":"N/A","Treasure":"Nil","XP Value":"120"},"Phycomid":{"Activity Cycle":"Any","Alignment":"Neutral (evil)","Armor Class":"5","Climate/Terrain":"Subterranean","Damage/Attack":"3-6/3-6","Diet":"Scavenger","Frequency":"Rare","Hit Dice":"5","Intelligence":"Unratable","Magic Resistance":"Nil","Morale":"Elite (14)","Movement":"3","No. Appearing":"1-4","No. of Attacks":"2","Organization":"Multicellular","Size":"T (2' dia.)","Special Attacks":"Infection","Special Defenses":"See below","THAC0":"15","Treasure":"Nil","XP Value":"650"},"Shrieker":{"Activity Cycle":"Any","Alignment":"Neutral","Armor Class":"7","Climate/Terrain":"Subterranean","Damage/Attack":"Nil","Diet":"Scavenger","Frequency":"Common","Hit Dice":"3","Intelligence":"Non- (0)","Magic Resistance":"Nil","Morale":"Steady (12)","Movement":"1","No. Appearing":"2-8 (2d4)","No. of Attacks":"0","Organization":"Multicellular","Size":"M (4-7')","Special Attacks":"Nil","Special Defenses":"Noise","THAC0":"17","Treasure":"Nil","XP Value":"120"},"Violet":{"Activity Cycle":"Any","Alignment":"Neutral","Armor Class":"7","Climate/Terrain":"Subterranean","Damage/Attack":"See below","Diet":"Scavenger","Frequency":"Rare","Hit Dice":"3","Intelligence":"Non- (0)","Magic Resistance":"Nil","Morale":"Steady (12)","Movement":"1","No. Appearing":"1-4","No. of Attacks":"1-4","Organization":"Multicellular","Size":"M (4-7')","Special Attacks":"See below","Special Defenses":"Nil","THAC0":"17","Treasure":"Nil","XP Value":"175"}},"title":"Fungus"},"sources":["2140","2103"],"statblock_names":[],"title":"Fungus","prev_key":"fungcush","next_key":"funno","monster_path":"/appendix/fungus"}},"staticQueryHashes":[],"slicesMap":{}}
