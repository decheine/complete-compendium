While the powers listed above are the most common, some aarakocra have different or additional powers.</p><p class=\"f\">A race of intelligent, birdlike creatures living in the deepest deserts of Athas, the rare Athasian <a href=\"/appendix/aarakocr\">aarakocra</a> spends its time soaring on thermals in search of food.</p><p>The aarakocra is 7 to 8 feet tall with a wingspan of 20 feet or more. Because of its large wingspan, an aarakocra can carry as much as 75% of its own body weight and still fly easily. An aarakocra can fly a short distance carrying a burden equaling 125% of its own body weight. The average body weight of a full grown male is 100 pounds and a female is 85 pounds.</p><p>Each wing has a &ldquo;hand&rdquo; at its midpoint, consisting of three fingers and an opposable thumb. The fourth finger forms the rigid leading edge of the wing. In flight the hands cannot be used, but on the ground the aarakocra can use its hands almost as a human would. The aarakocra's body is protected by a thin bony plate on the chest, much like a solid rib cage. Talons on its legs can be used as claws and can be retracted to reveal a second set of hands, also with three fingers and an opposable thumb. Except for the chest plate, the entire skeleton is hollow and extremely fragile.</p><p>From a distance, the Athasian aarakocra resembles a huge <a href=\"/appendix/bird\">vulture</a>. Its black eyes, set in the front of the head, provide excellent vision over a long range. The plumage is generally black with a white collar for adult males and black or brown with a smaller white collar for females. Adolescents are a mixture of brown and black. The beak is large and covers most of the head. Plumage begins at the crown of the head and is darker near the head, except for the collar. Athasian aarakocra speak their own language and the languages of vultures and other large birds. Some speak the common tongue (5% to 10% chance depending on how deep in the wastelands a tribe lives).</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Combat:</b> Aarakocra can fight in the air or on the ground. They prefer aerial combat since their bones are too fragile to withstand a solid blow from a human-sized opponent. In combat against creatures on the ground, they prefer to fly over their victim and drop weighted nets. Some aarakocra use darts to harass ground-based opponents.</p><p>If their opponents can fly, the aarakocra generally forgo the use of the net, although large groups sometimes use nets on flying creatures. Normally, aarakocra attack flying creatures with long spears, diving from above and allowing the momentum to carry the spear through the target. Such an attack doubles the damage if the aarakocra have been able to dive at least 50 feet. Only the very largest aarakocra can carry more than one of these spears, they can attack with both at once with no penalty, causing double damage on each strike. All diving attacks are made at +4 and should be treated as a charge attack. All other penalties and restrictions of charge attacks apply.</p><p>The effect of the aarakocra's nets depends on if the opponent is flying at the time it becomes entangled. Creatures on the ground that are hit by a net are entangled and unable to participate in any combat until they make a successful Strength check to get free of the net. Flying creatures hit by a net can no longer fly and immediately begin falling. If they cannot escape the net or use some magical means to arrest the fall, normal falling damage applies.</p><p>Unless victims are entangled in nets, aarakocra are cautious in ground combat. If the aarakocra outnumber their opponents they advance in a straight line and thrust with their spears. If outnumbered, or the opponents are particularly tough, the aarakocra withdraw. Victims entangled in nets are killed or incapacitated for use as food or ransom.</p><p>Athasian aarakocra are mindful of their physical limitations as well as their comparatively low psionic abilities. They do not normally initiate psionic combat. At the first sign of psionic powers from any of their victims, however, all aarakocra that have some ability will use whatever attack and defense modes they can in an attempt to destroy the threat. Large groups of is or more aarakocra may initiate psionic combat if their leaders feel they can win quickly and avoid physical combat.</p><p>In desperation, an aarakocra can attempt to bite an opponent in combat. Because of the unwieldiness of its beak, the aarakocra has a THAC0 of 18 if attacking with this appendage. Further, the birdman causes only 1d2 points of damage with the beak.</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Habitat/Society:</b> Athasian aarakocra live in tribes with 6-20 (2d8+4) members, depending on the prestige of the leader. The largest tribe ever recorded had 50 members. The tribal hunting territory depends on the size of the tribe, usually about 500 square miles for a tribe of 10 members. There are no rigid boundaries between tribes and border disputes are not uncommon.</p><p>Alignments of tribe members are similar to the alignment of the leader. A tribe that has a leader who is neutral good may have neutral good, chaotic good, lawful good, and true neutral members. A predominantly evil tribe does not recognize boundaries with other tribes and treats other tribes as inferior beings to be eliminated.</p><p>Athasian aarakocra aren't happy in enclosed spaces, but they they take refuge in a cave or building if necessary.</p><p>Nonevil tribes live in rocky aeries in the highest peaks they can find. Evil tribes are normally nomadic and use an aerie made by another tribe if they need to remain in an area for a long time, even if they have to evict the tribe that made the nest.</p><p>Aarakocra aren't friendly toward intruders in their territory, especially caravans. They try to extract a toll from the caravan for passage through the desert. Good-aligned tribes allow unhindered passage of caravans that pay a tribute. If someone refuses to pay the tribute, the aarakocra try to capture scouts or outriders from the party and hold them until an even larger tribute is paid. The payment may be either livestock or shiny objects. Aarakocra are smart enough not to be taken in by glass baubles instead of gems, although they cannot tell the difference between the more common gems and the rare ones.</p><p>Evil tribes ask for tribute and often attack a caravan whether it pays or not. Aarakocra always demand shiny objects such as stones. These tribes find humans and demihumans to be quite tasty and prefer them to other food.</p><p>Good-aligned tribes of aarakocra sometimes return a lost traveler to the edge of the desert after first removing any valuables the traveler may be carrying. On very rare occasions a tribe might return a lost group of travelers to the more frequently traveled parts of the desert, again after first taking any valuables as payment.</p><p>The oldest male is the leader of the tribal hunting party and has 4+4 Hit Dice. The oldest female is in charge of the tribal aerie and has 3+3 HD. In tribes that have more than 15 members, the next oldest aarakocra serves as shaman and has 3+3 HD; the shaman completes the triumvirate necessary for proper worship and the summoning of elementals. (Interestingly, no magic-using aarakocra has ever been recorded.) Tribes without a shaman cannot summon <a href=\"/appendix/element1\">air elementals</a>, which is an important part of aarakocra culture.</p><p>The shaman is the leader of the daily sun worship. Aarakocra worship the sun because it provides them with the thermals they need to soar in search of food. The shaman also leads the mystic rituals used to summon an air elemental. Summoning an air elemental is usually done only in preparation for the tribe's most sacred ceremony, the hunt. Small tribes must band together for this ceremony to allow the triumvirate to be formed.</p><p>The ceremony to summon an air elemental must be conducted at dawn and requires the oldest male and female to emit a highpitched keening whistle. The shaman conducts an intricate dance around them, simultaneously chanting an ancient summoning mantra.</p><p>The hunt is the final part of the initiation of adolescent aarakocra to adulthood and often takes the tribe far from their normal teritory. The target is always a <a href=\"/appendix/drakalsi\">silt drake</a>. The hunt is the only time the females leave the relative safety of the nest. Even an evil tribe will not interfere with a tribe on a hunt. An air elemental is often summoned to help find the drake, but never takes part in the actual combat. Although the adult members of the tribe take part in the initial phases of the combat, it is the initiates who deliver the final, killing blows to me drake. Scars from the hunt are considered a mark of pride among all aarakocra.</p><p>The females spend about eight months of the year incubating their eggs. Athasian aarakocra mate for life and a pair normally produces as many as 10 offspring. A female lays one egg a year. Constant incubation is not required because of the high daytime temperatures, so the females can maintain the nest and keep the tribe's treasure in order.</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Ecology:</b> Athasian aarakocra are high on the food chain and have no natural enemies other than <a href=\"/appendix/drakatha\">drakes</a>. Unless evil, aarakocra leave their own territory only to hunt the silt drake and return as soon as possible when the hunt is over. (Evil aarakocra attack others, as noted above.) Aarakocra eggs and hatchlings are sought after by wealthy land owners who wish to use the creatures as scouts and sentries. An egg can bring as much as 10 cp in Tyr's marketplace. Tribes that have had eggs or hatchlings stolen have long memories and sometimes take revenge against the thief at a later date. Captive aarakocra join any tribe they come in contact with.</p><p>Athasian aarakocra have a natural life span of 21-30 years.</p><p></p><br clear=\"all\" style=\"clear:both; height:0;\">\r\n","images":["<img src=\"grf/ds.gif\" width=\"150\" height=\"75\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Dark Sun\" title=\"Dark Sun\" align=\"right\">","<img src=\"img/aarakath.gif\" alt=\"Aarakocra (Athas)\" title=\"Aarakocra (Athas)\" border=\"0\" width=\"300\" height=\"360\" style=\"text-align:right;\" align=\"right\">","<img src=\"grf/add2_01.gif\" width=\"200\" height=\"56\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Advanced Dungeons & Dragons 2nd Edition\">"],"setting":"Dark Sun","statblock":{"Aarakocra (Athas)":{"Activity Cycle":"Day","Alignment":"Any","Armor Class":"7","Climate/Terrain":"Deep desert","Damage/Attack":"1d3/1d3 or by weapon","Diet":"Carnivore","Frequency":"Rare","Hit Dice":"2+2","Intelligence":"Average (8-10)","Magic Resistance":"Nil","Morale":"Steady (11)","Movement":"6, Fl 36 (C)","No. Appearing":"1d10","No. of Attacks":"2","Organization":"Tribal","Size":"M (20'+ wingspan)","Special Attacks":"Nil","Special Defenses":"Nil","THAC0":"17","Treasure":"Varies","XP Value":"65"}},"title":"Aarakocra (Athas)"},"sources":["2433"],"statblock_names":[],"title":"Aarakocra (Athas)","prev_key":"zygraat","next_key":"aarakocr","monster_path":"/appendix/aarakath"}}},"pageContext":{"monster_key":"wolfgh","monster_data":{"TSR":["9337"],"fullBody":"  <table cellspacing=\"0\" cellpadding=\"0\"><tr><th>Climate/Terrain:</th>  <td>Any non-tropical/Land</td></tr><tr><th>Frequency:</th>        <td>Uncommon</td></tr><tr><th>Organization:</th>     <td>Family</td></tr><tr><th>Activity Cycle:</th>   <td>Any</td></tr><tr><th>Diet:</th>             <td>Carnivore</td></tr><tr><th>Intelligence:</th>     <td>Low (5-7)</td></tr><tr><th>Treasure:</th>         <td>Nil</td></tr><tr><th>Alignment:</th>        <td>Neutral</td></tr><tr><th>No. Appearing:</th>    <td>2- 12 (1 % chance of a lone wolf)</td></tr><tr><th>Armor Class:</th>      <td>7</td></tr><tr><th>Movement:</th>         <td>18</td></tr><tr><th>Hit Dice:</th>         <td>3</td></tr><tr><th>THAC0:</th>            <td>17</td></tr><tr><th>No. of Attacks:</th>   <td>1</td></tr><tr><th>Damage/Attack:</th>    <td>2-5</td></tr><tr><th>Special Attacks:</th>  <td>Nil</td></tr><tr><th>Special Defenses:</th> <td>+1 vs. charms because of its intelligence</td></tr><tr><th>Magic Resistance:</th> <td>Nil</td></tr><tr><th>Size:</th>             <td>S (2'-4' long)</td></tr><tr><th>Morale:</th>           <td>Average (10)</td></tr><tr><th>XP Value:</th>         <td>120 </td></tr></table><p class=\"f\">the wolf is shrouded in mystery and suspicion. Humans commonly view the wolf as a vicious killer that slaughters man and animals alike for the lack of better things to do. It is believed these rumors were started by people who were afraid of its high intelligence and tenacity. The truth is that never in recorded history has a non-rabid or non-charmed wolf attacked a human or demihuman. (The chance of encountering a rabid wolf is 1% if a lone wolf is confronted.)</p><p>The eyes of wolves are a golden or amber color. Although fur colorations vary from species to species, based upon the climate they inhabit, all wolves have various features in common. They are characterized by powerful jaws, wide strong teeth, bushy tails, tall, strong ears, and round pupils. The wolves of the north exhibit colors from pure white, grey, to black, and all shades and mixes in between. The southern wolves, and those living in more arid climes, are reddish and brown in color. </p><p>The wolf is a very active and cunning carnivore, capable of surviving in nearly every climate and terrain known. They have been seen-or at least their tracks have been seen - even in the most arid of deserts, but this is a very uncommon occurrence. </p><p class=\"f\"><b>Combat:</b> Wolves most commonly hunt in packs during winter and late fall when larger herbivores (<a href=\"/appendix/mammal\">deer</a>, moose, <a href=\"/appendix/mammher2\">caribou</a>, musk oxen) are the only prey available. Wolves prefer smaller prey because larger animals require much more effort to run down. Even then, the wolves catch only the weakest or the sickest animals.</p><p>Wolves usually hunt only one large quarry per week per pack, going without food for days at a time. Wolves prefer eating smaller prey like mice, squirrels, and other rodents because they are easier to catch and they are more plentiful. During summer months, a wolf can consume over 20 mice in a day</p><p>Humans poison carrion in hopes of killing the wolves. This poisoning has been effective in some areas, but mostly the poisoning kills only the coyotes that follow the wolf packs to feast upon the carcass once the wolves move on. Man also fears that the wolf will kill livestock. This happens on occasion, but only in areas where the wolf pack is surrounded on all sides by human settlements. When this occurs, the wolves have no other prey, since the indigenous deer and other game have been killed by humans. The wolves prefer to hunt wild game, as opposed to killing cattle that requires that they enter human territory. </p><p>If a wolf or wolf pack is attacked by humans, wolves tend to run away unless backed into a corner. Even then, they attack-usually by tearing at the clothing or legs and arms-only until they have an opening to escape. Man is the only creature wolves fear, and this explains why wolves can be so hard to locate. Wolves leave an area once human encroachment occurs. This enables them to survive poisoning and human hunters so well. </p><p class=\"f\"><b>Habitat/Society:</b> Wolves, like humans and demi-humans, are social animals. They live, hunt and play in  packs-or families, as many sages call them. There is a  very strict social structure in these family groups. </p><p>Each pack is led by a male, known as the <i>alpha male</i><a href=\"#footnote1\" aria-describedby=\"footnote-label\" style=\"vertical-align: super;\">[1]</a>.  This male is the strongest and usually the largest of the  wolves. His mate, the alpha female is the largest and  strongest of the females. When large prey are brought  down, the alpha male and female are the first to gorge  themselves. Thereafter, the other wolves in the packs eat  in order of their strength. (This weeds out the weaker  wolves.)</p><p>It is common for wolves to challenge those of a higher  social status. This is a necessary element in the social  structure of the wolf pack. Social status determines who  can eat and when, and it also dictates the right to breed. </p><p>Only the alpha male and alpha female breed, but the beta female-the second ranking female, or a former alpha female-often helps in whelping and nursing the cubs. This assures the continued strength and genetic vitality of the wolf family. Many believe this results in inbreeding, which causes defects to increase. This is true, but the superior traits also become stronger. When a defective wolf is born-and survives-it is weaker than the rest of the pack, and it does not get a chance to breed A stronger wolf-one without the defect-has the opport?- nity to challenge the alpha wolf in order to breed his strong genes back into the pack. (Non-alpha wolves in the same pack assist the alphas in assuring that no other wolves in the pack breed. This guarantees the success of the pack.)</p><p>When humans or demihumans encounter wolves, these shy animals tend to scamper away in fear, looking back momentarily to make sure they are not being followed. Often the only way man knows they exist is by spotting their tracks the next morning.</p><p>Wolves prefer areas not inhabited by other predators. Their domain usually has a wide variety of terrain features on which they can play. Large rocks, fallen trees, brooks, and streams are important parts of their recreational activities. Without these features, the wolves quickly move on until they find a more exciting location.</p><p>Areas with easily dug dirt is important as well. Wolves dig dens in this soil to birth their cubs. If the same den is used year after year, the den is dug deeper each time. This instinct helps protect the cubs from predators.</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Ecology:</b> Wolves are valuable hunters in the wild, helping to keep nature in balance. In many areas, fear of the beautiful wolf has caused mass hunting and extinction. This causes a marked increase in the rodent and deer populations, which raises havoc with the surrounding ecosystems. Without man's hunting, the variations in the wolf population follow those in the deer and caribou population. When deer and caribou are plentiful, wolves are plentiful: when deer and caribou herds are smalloften due to hard winters or dry summers-many wolves starve, sufficiently lowering their numbers to balance the ecosystem. </p><p>In many arctic regions, men stake their in-heat sledge dog females outside for the wolves to mate. They believe this increases the vigor of the breed. In truth, all it does is create an animal torn between its desire to please a master and its instinct to run wild and free with others of its kind. </p><p>A few men have made contact with the wolf. This is a very difficult thing to do. Complete understanding of the wolfs language is required. This language is very simple by human standards, yet few humans have attempted to learn it or even acknowledge its existence. </p><p>Humans believe that the wolfs howl is its way of marking its territory. This is false. The howl is used when the wolf has scampered off to investigate something, and the rest of the pack has moved elsewhere, out of sight. The howl is a dire</p><p>Wolves stare down their opponents in order to determine who is the stronger. This is commonly used as a disciplinary action by the alpha male, when a lower male-or female-has done something against the social code. This glance is usually enough to make the transgressing wolf cower at the feet of the alpha male, rolling on its back to expose its vitals. This is a sign of submissiveness.</p><p class=\"footnotes\"><i>Archivist's footnotes</i></p><ol class=\"footnote-list\"><li id=\"footnote1\">This model has long been discredited, even by the biologist who originally proposed the \"alpha male\" idea, and in reality are not lead by any individual but by the general family group.</li></ol><p></p>\n","images":["<img src=\"grf/gh.gif\" width=\"150\" height=\"75\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Greyhawk\" title=\"Greyhawk\" align=\"right\">","<img src=\"img/wolfgh.gif\" alt=\"Wolf (Greyhawk)\" title=\"Wolf (Greyhawk)\" border=\"0\" width=\"300\" height=\"360\" style=\"text-align:right;\" align=\"right\">","<img src=\"grf/tsr_sm.png\" width=\"56\" height=\"59\" border=\"0\" alt=\"TSR\">"],"setting":"Greyhawk","statblock":{"Wolf (Greyhawk)":{"Activity Cycle":"Any","Alignment":"Neutral","Armor Class":"7","Climate/Terrain":"Any non-tropical/Land","Damage/Attack":"2-5","Diet":"Carnivore","Frequency":"Uncommon","Hit Dice":"3","Intelligence":"Low (5-7)","Magic Resistance":"Nil","Morale":"Average (10)","Movement":"18","No. Appearing":"2- 12 (1 % chance of a lone wolf)","No. of Attacks":"1","Organization":"Family","Size":"S (2'-4' long)","Special Attacks":"Nil","Special Defenses":"+1 vs. charms because of its intelligence","THAC0":"17","Treasure":"Nil","XP Value":"120 "}},"title":"Wolf (Greyhawk)"},"sources":["9337"],"statblock_names":[],"title":"Wolf (Greyhawk)","prev_key":"wolfdrea","next_key":"wolfmist","monster_path":"/appendix/wolfgh"}},"staticQueryHashes":[],"slicesMap":{}}
