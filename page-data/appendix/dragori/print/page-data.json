While the powers listed above are the most common, some aarakocra have different or additional powers.</p><p class=\"f\">A race of intelligent, birdlike creatures living in the deepest deserts of Athas, the rare Athasian <a href=\"/appendix/aarakocr\">aarakocra</a> spends its time soaring on thermals in search of food.</p><p>The aarakocra is 7 to 8 feet tall with a wingspan of 20 feet or more. Because of its large wingspan, an aarakocra can carry as much as 75% of its own body weight and still fly easily. An aarakocra can fly a short distance carrying a burden equaling 125% of its own body weight. The average body weight of a full grown male is 100 pounds and a female is 85 pounds.</p><p>Each wing has a &ldquo;hand&rdquo; at its midpoint, consisting of three fingers and an opposable thumb. The fourth finger forms the rigid leading edge of the wing. In flight the hands cannot be used, but on the ground the aarakocra can use its hands almost as a human would. The aarakocra's body is protected by a thin bony plate on the chest, much like a solid rib cage. Talons on its legs can be used as claws and can be retracted to reveal a second set of hands, also with three fingers and an opposable thumb. Except for the chest plate, the entire skeleton is hollow and extremely fragile.</p><p>From a distance, the Athasian aarakocra resembles a huge <a href=\"/appendix/bird\">vulture</a>. Its black eyes, set in the front of the head, provide excellent vision over a long range. The plumage is generally black with a white collar for adult males and black or brown with a smaller white collar for females. Adolescents are a mixture of brown and black. The beak is large and covers most of the head. Plumage begins at the crown of the head and is darker near the head, except for the collar. Athasian aarakocra speak their own language and the languages of vultures and other large birds. Some speak the common tongue (5% to 10% chance depending on how deep in the wastelands a tribe lives).</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Combat:</b> Aarakocra can fight in the air or on the ground. They prefer aerial combat since their bones are too fragile to withstand a solid blow from a human-sized opponent. In combat against creatures on the ground, they prefer to fly over their victim and drop weighted nets. Some aarakocra use darts to harass ground-based opponents.</p><p>If their opponents can fly, the aarakocra generally forgo the use of the net, although large groups sometimes use nets on flying creatures. Normally, aarakocra attack flying creatures with long spears, diving from above and allowing the momentum to carry the spear through the target. Such an attack doubles the damage if the aarakocra have been able to dive at least 50 feet. Only the very largest aarakocra can carry more than one of these spears, they can attack with both at once with no penalty, causing double damage on each strike. All diving attacks are made at +4 and should be treated as a charge attack. All other penalties and restrictions of charge attacks apply.</p><p>The effect of the aarakocra's nets depends on if the opponent is flying at the time it becomes entangled. Creatures on the ground that are hit by a net are entangled and unable to participate in any combat until they make a successful Strength check to get free of the net. Flying creatures hit by a net can no longer fly and immediately begin falling. If they cannot escape the net or use some magical means to arrest the fall, normal falling damage applies.</p><p>Unless victims are entangled in nets, aarakocra are cautious in ground combat. If the aarakocra outnumber their opponents they advance in a straight line and thrust with their spears. If outnumbered, or the opponents are particularly tough, the aarakocra withdraw. Victims entangled in nets are killed or incapacitated for use as food or ransom.</p><p>Athasian aarakocra are mindful of their physical limitations as well as their comparatively low psionic abilities. They do not normally initiate psionic combat. At the first sign of psionic powers from any of their victims, however, all aarakocra that have some ability will use whatever attack and defense modes they can in an attempt to destroy the threat. Large groups of is or more aarakocra may initiate psionic combat if their leaders feel they can win quickly and avoid physical combat.</p><p>In desperation, an aarakocra can attempt to bite an opponent in combat. Because of the unwieldiness of its beak, the aarakocra has a THAC0 of 18 if attacking with this appendage. Further, the birdman causes only 1d2 points of damage with the beak.</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Habitat/Society:</b> Athasian aarakocra live in tribes with 6-20 (2d8+4) members, depending on the prestige of the leader. The largest tribe ever recorded had 50 members. The tribal hunting territory depends on the size of the tribe, usually about 500 square miles for a tribe of 10 members. There are no rigid boundaries between tribes and border disputes are not uncommon.</p><p>Alignments of tribe members are similar to the alignment of the leader. A tribe that has a leader who is neutral good may have neutral good, chaotic good, lawful good, and true neutral members. A predominantly evil tribe does not recognize boundaries with other tribes and treats other tribes as inferior beings to be eliminated.</p><p>Athasian aarakocra aren't happy in enclosed spaces, but they they take refuge in a cave or building if necessary.</p><p>Nonevil tribes live in rocky aeries in the highest peaks they can find. Evil tribes are normally nomadic and use an aerie made by another tribe if they need to remain in an area for a long time, even if they have to evict the tribe that made the nest.</p><p>Aarakocra aren't friendly toward intruders in their territory, especially caravans. They try to extract a toll from the caravan for passage through the desert. Good-aligned tribes allow unhindered passage of caravans that pay a tribute. If someone refuses to pay the tribute, the aarakocra try to capture scouts or outriders from the party and hold them until an even larger tribute is paid. The payment may be either livestock or shiny objects. Aarakocra are smart enough not to be taken in by glass baubles instead of gems, although they cannot tell the difference between the more common gems and the rare ones.</p><p>Evil tribes ask for tribute and often attack a caravan whether it pays or not. Aarakocra always demand shiny objects such as stones. These tribes find humans and demihumans to be quite tasty and prefer them to other food.</p><p>Good-aligned tribes of aarakocra sometimes return a lost traveler to the edge of the desert after first removing any valuables the traveler may be carrying. On very rare occasions a tribe might return a lost group of travelers to the more frequently traveled parts of the desert, again after first taking any valuables as payment.</p><p>The oldest male is the leader of the tribal hunting party and has 4+4 Hit Dice. The oldest female is in charge of the tribal aerie and has 3+3 HD. In tribes that have more than 15 members, the next oldest aarakocra serves as shaman and has 3+3 HD; the shaman completes the triumvirate necessary for proper worship and the summoning of elementals. (Interestingly, no magic-using aarakocra has ever been recorded.) Tribes without a shaman cannot summon <a href=\"/appendix/element1\">air elementals</a>, which is an important part of aarakocra culture.</p><p>The shaman is the leader of the daily sun worship. Aarakocra worship the sun because it provides them with the thermals they need to soar in search of food. The shaman also leads the mystic rituals used to summon an air elemental. Summoning an air elemental is usually done only in preparation for the tribe's most sacred ceremony, the hunt. Small tribes must band together for this ceremony to allow the triumvirate to be formed.</p><p>The ceremony to summon an air elemental must be conducted at dawn and requires the oldest male and female to emit a highpitched keening whistle. The shaman conducts an intricate dance around them, simultaneously chanting an ancient summoning mantra.</p><p>The hunt is the final part of the initiation of adolescent aarakocra to adulthood and often takes the tribe far from their normal teritory. The target is always a <a href=\"/appendix/drakalsi\">silt drake</a>. The hunt is the only time the females leave the relative safety of the nest. Even an evil tribe will not interfere with a tribe on a hunt. An air elemental is often summoned to help find the drake, but never takes part in the actual combat. Although the adult members of the tribe take part in the initial phases of the combat, it is the initiates who deliver the final, killing blows to me drake. Scars from the hunt are considered a mark of pride among all aarakocra.</p><p>The females spend about eight months of the year incubating their eggs. Athasian aarakocra mate for life and a pair normally produces as many as 10 offspring. A female lays one egg a year. Constant incubation is not required because of the high daytime temperatures, so the females can maintain the nest and keep the tribe's treasure in order.</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Ecology:</b> Athasian aarakocra are high on the food chain and have no natural enemies other than <a href=\"/appendix/drakatha\">drakes</a>. Unless evil, aarakocra leave their own territory only to hunt the silt drake and return as soon as possible when the hunt is over. (Evil aarakocra attack others, as noted above.) Aarakocra eggs and hatchlings are sought after by wealthy land owners who wish to use the creatures as scouts and sentries. An egg can bring as much as 10 cp in Tyr's marketplace. Tribes that have had eggs or hatchlings stolen have long memories and sometimes take revenge against the thief at a later date. Captive aarakocra join any tribe they come in contact with.</p><p>Athasian aarakocra have a natural life span of 21-30 years.</p><br clear=\"all\" style=\"clear:both; height:0;\">\r\n","images":["<img src=\"grf/ds.gif\" width=\"150\" height=\"75\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Dark Sun\" title=\"Dark Sun\" align=\"right\">","<img src=\"img/aarakath.gif\" alt=\"Aarakocra (Athas)\" title=\"Aarakocra (Athas)\" border=\"0\" width=\"300\" height=\"360\" style=\"text-align:right;\" align=\"right\">","<img src=\"grf/add2_01.gif\" width=\"200\" height=\"56\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Advanced Dungeons & Dragons 2nd Edition\">"],"setting":"Dark Sun","statblock":{"Aarakocra (Athas)":{"Activity Cycle":"Day","Alignment":"Any","Armor Class":"7","Climate/Terrain":"Deep desert","Damage/Attack":"1d3/1d3 or by weapon","Diet":"Carnivore","Frequency":"Rare","Hit Dice":"2+2","Intelligence":"Average (8-10)","Magic Resistance":"Nil","Morale":"Steady (11)","Movement":"6, Fl 36 (C)","No. Appearing":"1d10","No. of Attacks":"2","Organization":"Tribal","Size":"M (20'+ wingspan)","Special Attacks":"Nil","Special Defenses":"Nil","THAC0":"17","Treasure":"Varies","XP Value":"65"}},"title":"Aarakocra (Athas)"},"sources":["2433"],"statblock_names":[],"title":"Aarakocra (Athas)","prev_key":"zygraat","next_key":"aarakocr","monster_path":"/appendix/aarakath"}}},"pageContext":{"monster_key":"dragori","monster_data":{"TSR":["2104"],"fullBody":"  <p class=\"f\">Oriental <a href=\"/appendix/dragon\">dragons</a>, especially of adult age and older, tend to be solitary creatures. When multiple dragons are encountered, they are usually a mated pair and young. Mated pairs are never found together when older than mature adults, and their offspring are always young adults or younger. To determine the age of the offspring, roll 1d6: 1 = egg, 2 = hatchling, 3 = very young, 4 = young, 5 = juvenile, 6 = young adult.</p><p class=\"f\"><b>The Celestial Bureaucracy:</b> Most oriental dragons are officials in the Celestial Bureaucracy, a governing body of powerful spirits headed by the Celestial Emperor. Each subspecies of oriental dragon is charged by the Celestial Bureaucracy to direct a particular governmental function; <a href=\"/appendix/dragoriv\">Chiang lung</a>, for instance, are charged with guarding rivers and lakes and dispensing rain.</p><p>Every year, the oriental dragon officers journey to the Celestial Palace to file their reports of the previous year's activities and events. Rewards and punishments are distributed based on the evaluation of the repords. A corrupt or inefficient dragon may be removed and replaced by a new appointee; an industrious dragon may be promoted to a position of higher responsibility.</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Hit Die and Combat Modifiers:</b> Oriental dragons' Hit Dice and combat modifiers vary according to age category. Consult the individual dragon entries for their base Hit Die information and the table below for the modifiers. An oriental dragon saves as a fighter equal in level to the dragon's Hit Dice. Its combat modifier applies to both attack and damage rolls for each physical attack; it does not apply to breath weapon or other special attacks. (For example, a li lung has 13 Hit Dice as a base. A very young <a href=\"/appendix/dragoear\">li lung</a> subtracts 4 dice, which gives it a total of 9 Hit Dice. It saves as a 9th-level fighter and has a +1 bonus applied to its physical attacks.)</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Oriental Dragons' Attacks and Defenses:</b> Like other dragons, oriental dragons have a claw/claw/bite attack. Though claws can attack creatures to the dragons' front and sides, only certain oriental dragons have necks long enough to enable them to attack opponents to their sides as well as to their front. Young adult and older oriental dragons able to fly can attempt snatch attacks like or her dragons (including a 50% chance that the snatched vitims's arms are pinned, automatic claw damage each round if the victim is squeezed, and a transfer to the dragon's mouth if an attack roll is successful, which then inflicts automatic bite damage each round). As indicated in the individual listings, only certain oriental dragons can attack with kicks, wing buffets, or tail slaps.</p><p>An oriental dragon's Armor Class improves as it ages, as does its ability to resist magic. Old and older oriental dragons are immune to normal missiles because of their tough hides. As with other dragons, the skin of an oriental dragon can be made into dragon armor that grants its wearer an Armor Class of 4 worse than the Armor Class of the dragon it was taken from (though the Armor Class can be no worse than 8).</p><p>Like other dragons, young adult and older oriental dragons radiate an aura that may cause opponents to panic. Humans and demihumans with fewer than 1 Hit Die  and non-aggressive creatures with fewer Hit Dice than the dragon automatically flee in panic for 4d6 minutes at the sight of the dragon. Other opponents may be panicked and forced to fight with a -2 penalty to both their attack and damage rolls if they are within the radius of an oriental dragon's fear aura and fail their saving throws vs. petrification. Victims adjust their saving throws by the modifier indicated on the following table; the table also lists the fear aura radius for each oriental dragon age category.</p><p>Diving oriental dragons can strike with their claws with a +1 bonus to the attack roll. When engaging other flying opponents, oriental dragons can either claw or bite, but not both.</p><p>Certain subspecies have the ability of <i>scaly command</i> that gives them control over varying numbers of scaly creatures with animal intelligence or less (primarily reptiles and fishes) living in the water within a half-mile radius. This control lasts for 2d6 turns and cannot be dispelled. No saving throws are allowed. Creatures under the <i>scaly command</i> cannot fall under the control of another. Additionaliy, scaly creatures will never voluntarily attack an oriental dragon with the caly command ability.</p><p>Other subspecies have the ability to surround themselves in an aura of <i>water fire</i> whenever they are under or touching water. <i>Water fire</i> appears as ghostly, flickering multi-colored flames and causes a variable amount of damage to anyone who touches it. All oriental dragons are themselves immune to <i>water fire</i>. It may be dispelled by the creator at any time; otherwise, it disappears for 2d6 turns if contacted by real or magical fire, and cannot be recreated until the end of that period.</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Special Abilities:</b> </p><p>Oriental dragons do not have the spellcasting abilities of other dragons, and not all of them have breath weapons. They do, however, have several special abilities of their own. All, for instance, have continual <i>ESP</i> (as the spell) at a range in feet equal to five times their age level. Oriental dragons do not require sleep. All can become invisible and visible at will, though they always become visible when attacking. All except <a href=\"/appendix/dragocar\">yu lung</a> can <i>polymorph</i> into human form and back at will.</p><p>Oriental dragons can detect invisible objects and creatures (including those hidden in darkness or fog) within a ten-foot radius per age category. They also have a natural <i>clairaudience</i> ability with respect to their lairs; the range is 20 feet per age category. The dragon must concentrate on a specific section of its lair or the surrounding area to use this ability.</p><p>Most oriental dragons can fly because of the powers of a magical gem or pearl that is imbedded within the brain. This object functions only for the dragon and cannot be extracted so as to confer flight on any other creature.</p><table class=\"ip\"><tr class=\"bk\"><th>Age Category</th><th>Actual Age</th><th>Hit Die Modifier</th><th>Combat Modifier</th><th>Fear Radius</th><th>Fear Save Modifier</th></tr><tr><td>1 Hatchling</td><td>0-5</td><td>-6</td><td>0</td><td>Nil</td><td>Nil</td></tr><tr><td>2 Very young</td><td>6-15</td><td>-4</td><td>+1</td><td>Nil</td><td>Nil</td></tr><tr><td>3 Young</td><td>16-25</td><td>-2</td><td>+2</td><td>Nil</td><td>Nil</td></tr><tr><td>4 Juvenile</td><td>26-50</td><td>-1</td><td>+3</td><td>Nil</td><td>Nil</td></tr><tr><td>5 Young adult</td><td>51-100</td><td>0</td><td>+4</td><td>10 yards</td><td>+4</td></tr><tr><td>6 Adult</td><td>101-200</td><td>+1</td><td>+5</td><td>15 yards</td><td>+3</td></tr><tr><td>7 Mature adult</td><td>201-400</td><td>+2</td><td>+6</td><td>20 yards</td><td>+2</td></tr><tr><td>8 Old</td><td>401-600</td><td>+3</td><td>+7</td><td>25 yards</td><td>+1</td></tr><tr><td>9 Very old</td><td>601-800</td><td>+4</td><td>+8</td><td>30 yards</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>10 Venerable</td><td>801-1,000</td><td>+5</td><td>+9</td><td>35 yards</td><td>-1</td></tr><tr><td>11 Wyrm</td><td>1,001-1,200</td><td>+6</td><td>+10</td><td>40 yards</td><td>-2</td></tr><tr><td>12 Great Wyrm</td><td>1,200+</td><td>+7</td><td>+11</td><td>45 yards</td><td>-3</td></tr></table><br clear=\"all\" style=\"clear:both; height:0;\">\r\n","images":["<img src=\"grf/kt.gif\" width=\"150\" height=\"75\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Kara-Tur (Forgotten Realms)\" title=\"Kara-Tur (Forgotten Realms)\" align=\"right\">","<img src=\"grf/add2_01.gif\" width=\"200\" height=\"56\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Advanced Dungeons & Dragons 2nd Edition\">"],"setting":"Kara-Tur (Forgotten Realms)","title":"Dragon, Oriental (Lung), General Information"},"sources":["2104"],"statblock_names":[],"title":"Dragon, Oriental (Lung), General Information","prev_key":"dragonet","next_key":"dragoriv","monster_path":"/appendix/dragori"}},"staticQueryHashes":[],"slicesMap":{}}
