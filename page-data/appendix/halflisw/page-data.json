While the powers listed above are the most common, some aarakocra have different or additional powers.</p><p class=\"f\">A race of intelligent, birdlike creatures living in the deepest deserts of Athas, the rare Athasian <a href=\"/appendix/aarakocr\">aarakocra</a> spends its time soaring on thermals in search of food.</p><p>The aarakocra is 7 to 8 feet tall with a wingspan of 20 feet or more. Because of its large wingspan, an aarakocra can carry as much as 75% of its own body weight and still fly easily. An aarakocra can fly a short distance carrying a burden equaling 125% of its own body weight. The average body weight of a full grown male is 100 pounds and a female is 85 pounds.</p><p>Each wing has a &ldquo;hand&rdquo; at its midpoint, consisting of three fingers and an opposable thumb. The fourth finger forms the rigid leading edge of the wing. In flight the hands cannot be used, but on the ground the aarakocra can use its hands almost as a human would. The aarakocra's body is protected by a thin bony plate on the chest, much like a solid rib cage. Talons on its legs can be used as claws and can be retracted to reveal a second set of hands, also with three fingers and an opposable thumb. Except for the chest plate, the entire skeleton is hollow and extremely fragile.</p><p>From a distance, the Athasian aarakocra resembles a huge <a href=\"/appendix/bird\">vulture</a>. Its black eyes, set in the front of the head, provide excellent vision over a long range. The plumage is generally black with a white collar for adult males and black or brown with a smaller white collar for females. Adolescents are a mixture of brown and black. The beak is large and covers most of the head. Plumage begins at the crown of the head and is darker near the head, except for the collar. Athasian aarakocra speak their own language and the languages of vultures and other large birds. Some speak the common tongue (5% to 10% chance depending on how deep in the wastelands a tribe lives).</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Combat:</b> Aarakocra can fight in the air or on the ground. They prefer aerial combat since their bones are too fragile to withstand a solid blow from a human-sized opponent. In combat against creatures on the ground, they prefer to fly over their victim and drop weighted nets. Some aarakocra use darts to harass ground-based opponents.</p><p>If their opponents can fly, the aarakocra generally forgo the use of the net, although large groups sometimes use nets on flying creatures. Normally, aarakocra attack flying creatures with long spears, diving from above and allowing the momentum to carry the spear through the target. Such an attack doubles the damage if the aarakocra have been able to dive at least 50 feet. Only the very largest aarakocra can carry more than one of these spears, they can attack with both at once with no penalty, causing double damage on each strike. All diving attacks are made at +4 and should be treated as a charge attack. All other penalties and restrictions of charge attacks apply.</p><p>The effect of the aarakocra's nets depends on if the opponent is flying at the time it becomes entangled. Creatures on the ground that are hit by a net are entangled and unable to participate in any combat until they make a successful Strength check to get free of the net. Flying creatures hit by a net can no longer fly and immediately begin falling. If they cannot escape the net or use some magical means to arrest the fall, normal falling damage applies.</p><p>Unless victims are entangled in nets, aarakocra are cautious in ground combat. If the aarakocra outnumber their opponents they advance in a straight line and thrust with their spears. If outnumbered, or the opponents are particularly tough, the aarakocra withdraw. Victims entangled in nets are killed or incapacitated for use as food or ransom.</p><p>Athasian aarakocra are mindful of their physical limitations as well as their comparatively low psionic abilities. They do not normally initiate psionic combat. At the first sign of psionic powers from any of their victims, however, all aarakocra that have some ability will use whatever attack and defense modes they can in an attempt to destroy the threat. Large groups of is or more aarakocra may initiate psionic combat if their leaders feel they can win quickly and avoid physical combat.</p><p>In desperation, an aarakocra can attempt to bite an opponent in combat. Because of the unwieldiness of its beak, the aarakocra has a THAC0 of 18 if attacking with this appendage. Further, the birdman causes only 1d2 points of damage with the beak.</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Habitat/Society:</b> Athasian aarakocra live in tribes with 6-20 (2d8+4) members, depending on the prestige of the leader. The largest tribe ever recorded had 50 members. The tribal hunting territory depends on the size of the tribe, usually about 500 square miles for a tribe of 10 members. There are no rigid boundaries between tribes and border disputes are not uncommon.</p><p>Alignments of tribe members are similar to the alignment of the leader. A tribe that has a leader who is neutral good may have neutral good, chaotic good, lawful good, and true neutral members. A predominantly evil tribe does not recognize boundaries with other tribes and treats other tribes as inferior beings to be eliminated.</p><p>Athasian aarakocra aren't happy in enclosed spaces, but they they take refuge in a cave or building if necessary.</p><p>Nonevil tribes live in rocky aeries in the highest peaks they can find. Evil tribes are normally nomadic and use an aerie made by another tribe if they need to remain in an area for a long time, even if they have to evict the tribe that made the nest.</p><p>Aarakocra aren't friendly toward intruders in their territory, especially caravans. They try to extract a toll from the caravan for passage through the desert. Good-aligned tribes allow unhindered passage of caravans that pay a tribute. If someone refuses to pay the tribute, the aarakocra try to capture scouts or outriders from the party and hold them until an even larger tribute is paid. The payment may be either livestock or shiny objects. Aarakocra are smart enough not to be taken in by glass baubles instead of gems, although they cannot tell the difference between the more common gems and the rare ones.</p><p>Evil tribes ask for tribute and often attack a caravan whether it pays or not. Aarakocra always demand shiny objects such as stones. These tribes find humans and demihumans to be quite tasty and prefer them to other food.</p><p>Good-aligned tribes of aarakocra sometimes return a lost traveler to the edge of the desert after first removing any valuables the traveler may be carrying. On very rare occasions a tribe might return a lost group of travelers to the more frequently traveled parts of the desert, again after first taking any valuables as payment.</p><p>The oldest male is the leader of the tribal hunting party and has 4+4 Hit Dice. The oldest female is in charge of the tribal aerie and has 3+3 HD. In tribes that have more than 15 members, the next oldest aarakocra serves as shaman and has 3+3 HD; the shaman completes the triumvirate necessary for proper worship and the summoning of elementals. (Interestingly, no magic-using aarakocra has ever been recorded.) Tribes without a shaman cannot summon <a href=\"/appendix/element1\">air elementals</a>, which is an important part of aarakocra culture.</p><p>The shaman is the leader of the daily sun worship. Aarakocra worship the sun because it provides them with the thermals they need to soar in search of food. The shaman also leads the mystic rituals used to summon an air elemental. Summoning an air elemental is usually done only in preparation for the tribe's most sacred ceremony, the hunt. Small tribes must band together for this ceremony to allow the triumvirate to be formed.</p><p>The ceremony to summon an air elemental must be conducted at dawn and requires the oldest male and female to emit a highpitched keening whistle. The shaman conducts an intricate dance around them, simultaneously chanting an ancient summoning mantra.</p><p>The hunt is the final part of the initiation of adolescent aarakocra to adulthood and often takes the tribe far from their normal teritory. The target is always a <a href=\"/appendix/drakalsi\">silt drake</a>. The hunt is the only time the females leave the relative safety of the nest. Even an evil tribe will not interfere with a tribe on a hunt. An air elemental is often summoned to help find the drake, but never takes part in the actual combat. Although the adult members of the tribe take part in the initial phases of the combat, it is the initiates who deliver the final, killing blows to me drake. Scars from the hunt are considered a mark of pride among all aarakocra.</p><p>The females spend about eight months of the year incubating their eggs. Athasian aarakocra mate for life and a pair normally produces as many as 10 offspring. A female lays one egg a year. Constant incubation is not required because of the high daytime temperatures, so the females can maintain the nest and keep the tribe's treasure in order.</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Ecology:</b> Athasian aarakocra are high on the food chain and have no natural enemies other than <a href=\"/appendix/drakatha\">drakes</a>. Unless evil, aarakocra leave their own territory only to hunt the silt drake and return as soon as possible when the hunt is over. (Evil aarakocra attack others, as noted above.) Aarakocra eggs and hatchlings are sought after by wealthy land owners who wish to use the creatures as scouts and sentries. An egg can bring as much as 10 cp in Tyr's marketplace. Tribes that have had eggs or hatchlings stolen have long memories and sometimes take revenge against the thief at a later date. Captive aarakocra join any tribe they come in contact with.</p><p>Athasian aarakocra have a natural life span of 21-30 years.</p>\n","images":["<img src=\"grf/ds.gif\" width=\"150\" height=\"75\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Dark Sun\" title=\"Dark Sun\" align=\"right\">","<img src=\"img/aarakath.gif\" alt=\"Aarakocra (Athas)\" title=\"Aarakocra (Athas)\" border=\"0\" width=\"300\" height=\"360\" style=\"text-align:right;\" align=\"right\">","<img src=\"grf/add2_01.gif\" width=\"200\" height=\"56\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Advanced Dungeons & Dragons 2nd Edition\">"],"setting":"Dark Sun","statblock":{"Aarakocra (Athas)":{"Activity Cycle":"Day","Alignment":"Any","Armor Class":"7","Climate/Terrain":"Deep desert","Damage/Attack":"1d3/1d3 or by weapon","Diet":"Carnivore","Frequency":"Rare","Hit Dice":"2+2","Intelligence":"Average (8-10)","Magic Resistance":"Nil","Morale":"Steady (11)","Movement":"6, Fl 36 (C)","No. Appearing":"1d10","No. of Attacks":"2","Organization":"Tribal","Size":"M (20'+ wingspan)","Special Attacks":"Nil","Special Defenses":"Nil","THAC0":"17","Treasure":"Varies","XP Value":"65"}},"title":"Aarakocra (Athas)"},"sources":["2433"],"statblock_names":[],"title":"Aarakocra (Athas)","prev_key":"zygraat","next_key":"aarakocr","monster_path":"/appendix/aarakath"}}},"pageContext":{"monster_key":"halflisw","monster_data":{"TSR":["3140"],"fullBody":"  <table cellspacing=\"0\" cellpadding=\"0\"><tr class=\"bk\"><th> </th><th class=\"cn\">Domain Lord</th><th class=\"cn\">Slave</th><th class=\"cn\">Freedom Fighter</th></tr><tr><th>Climate/Terrain:</th>  <td>Woodlands, hills</td><td>Slave communities</td><td>Slave communities, forests</td></tr><tr><th>Frequency:</th>        <td>Rare</td><td>Common</td><td>Uncommon</td></tr><tr><th>Organization:</th>     <td>Solitary</td><td>Community</td><td>Band</td></tr><tr><th>Activity Cycle:</th>   <td>Day</td><td>Day</td><td>Nocturnal</td></tr><tr><th>Diet:</th>             <td>Omnivore</td><td>Omnivore</td><td>Omnivore</td></tr><tr><th>Intelligence:</th>     <td>Very (11-12)</td><td>Average (8-10)</td><td>High (13-14)</td></tr><tr><th>Treasure:</th>         <td>W (G)</td><td>J (Ox3, Q)</td><td>K, M (Px3, W)</td></tr><tr><th>Alignment:</th>        <td>Lawful evil</td><td>Lawful neutral</td><td>Chaotic good</td></tr><tr><th>No. Appearing:</th>    <td>1</td><td>1-10 (20-200)</td><td>1-12</td></tr><tr><th>Armor Class:</th>      <td>7 (10)</td><td>10</td><td>7 (10)</td></tr><tr><th>Movement:</th>         <td>6</td><td>6</td><td>6</td></tr><tr><th>Hit Dice:</th>         <td>6 (d6)</td><td>1 (d6)</td><td>4 (d6)</td></tr><tr><th>THAC0:</th>            <td>18</td><td>20</td><td>17</td></tr><tr><th>No. of Attacks:</th>   <td>1</td><td>1</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><th>Damage/Attack:</th>    <td>By weapon or spell</td><td>1d4</td><td>By weapon</td></tr><tr><th>Special Attacks:</th>  <td>Seeming</td><td>None</td><td>Backstab, Seeming</td></tr><tr><th>Special Defenses:</th> <td>Seeming</td><td>None</td><td>Seeming</td></tr><tr><th>Magic Resistance:</th> <td>None</td><td>None</td><td>None</td></tr><tr><th>Size:</th>             <td>S (4' tall)</td><td>S (3' tall)</td><td>S (3'6\" tall)</td></tr><tr><th>Morale:</th>           <td>Elite (13-14)</td><td>Unsteady (5-7)</td><td>Champion (15-16)</td></tr><tr><th>Bloodline:</th>        <td>Azrai, tainted</td><td>None</td><td>None</td></tr><tr><th>Blood Abilities:</th>  <td>(1) Long life, Persuasion, or Resistance</td><td>None</td><td>None</td></tr><tr><th>Perception/Seeming:</th> <td>Lesser/Greater</td><td>Slight/Slight</td><td>Greater/Lesser</td></tr><tr><th>XP Value:</th>         <td>2,000</td><td>65</td><td>650</td></tr></table><p class=\"f\">Similar in many respects to the Cerilian halflings who escaped the escalating darkness, those halflings who stayed behind have been forever changed by their everworsening environment.</p><p>The appearance of a halfling varies with his or her social status (see “Habitat/Society,” below). Domain lords have access to the best food and live easier lives than other halflings; they therefore stand taller (about 4 feet) and weigh more (typically exhibiting a paunch) than the others. They dress themselves in fine, brightly colored robes and show off their wealth in the form of rings, jewels, crowns, and other adornments. </p><p>Slaves barely sustain themselves on what they are given to eat. Further, their state of constant fear takes its toll on their health. Halfling slaves rarely grow taller than 3 feet. They have emaciated builds and haunted looks in their eyes. They wear very plain, purely functional clothes of rough homespun and drab colors.</p><p>Freedom fighters (see below), though challenged by the difficulties of life on the run, manage to keep themselves in better physical condition than either of the other two classes. They hunt for their food and train for battle, nourishing their bodies and toning their muscles. Most importantly, their eyes still sparkle with life, fight, and hope. </p><p>Halflings account for the largest number of living, mortal Shadow World residents. Some, corrupted by evil, rule domains of their own. The vast majority have become a downtrodden, enslaved population forced into servitude for the Shadow World's many powerful denizens. But a few small bands exist who have not had their will beaten out of them. These individuals have become freedom fighters, and work for a day when good shall again triumph over evil and chase the shadows from their beloved homeland. </p><p class=\"f\"><b>Combat:</b> Combat training and abilities vary with each halfling's station in life. </p><p>Their dexterity and short statures grant all halflings an advantage when trying to gain surprise, provided they are not in metal armor. Nonhalfling foes suffer a -4 penalty to surprise rolls (-2 if a door or other screen must be opened).</p><p>Shadow World halflings have sturdy Constitutions that grant them a +3 bonus to saving throws vs. poison, wands, staves, rods, and spells. (The downtrodden slaves receive a bonus of only +2.)</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Domain Lords</b> seldom do their own fighting, relying instead on 2d6 trained guards (AC 6, HD 2, THAC0 18) armed with crossbows and short swords. Should direct combat become inevitable, domain lords defend themselves with short swords (1d6 points damage), held or thrown daggers (1d4+1 points damage), spells, and the Seeming. </p><p>As worshippers of the Cold Rider, domain lords are granted priest spells. They can cast eight spells per day (3/3/2), choosing from the following: <i>curse (bless), command, cause (cure) light wounds, protection from good (evil), cause (remove) fear; charm person or mammal, enthrall, obscurement; animate dead, cause (cure) blindness or deafness, cause (cure) disease, speak with dead</i>.</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Slaves </b> fight for their masters if forced, but suffer a -1 penalty to attack and damage rolls because their hearts aren't really in the effort. If defending themselves or their families, they fight without penalty.</p><p>Masters generally do not allow slaves to own arms; they fight, therefore, with whatever makeshift weapons are at hand. These often include slings (1d4+1 points damage), knives (1d3, +1 if thrown), hand axes (1d6, +1 if thrown), and sickles (1d4+1).</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Freedom fighters </b> wear leather armor to provide relative ease and silence of movement. Their preferred weapons are the short bow (1d6 points of damage), sling (1d4+1) and thrown daggers (1d4+1) at missile range, and the short sword in melee (1d6). They are, however, very resourceful, and in a tight spot can make use of just about any weapon or object at hand—from clubs and slings to stools and frying pans.</p><p>Freedom fighters live dangerous lives, and have developed several roguish skills in order to survive. These daring halflings can backstab (as 5th-level thieves) for three times normal damage and also possess the following abilities: </p><table><tr><td>Open locks</td><td>35%</td></tr><tr><td>Find/remove traps</td><td>35%</td></tr><tr><td>Move silently</td><td>70%</td></tr><tr><td>Hide in shadows</td><td>90%</td></tr><tr><td>Detect noise</td><td>50%</td></tr><tr><td>Climb walls</td><td>50%</td></tr></table><p>Once per day, domain lords and freedom fighters can <i>dimension door</i> or <i>shadow walk</i> (at the 10th level of ability), moving along the edges of the land's shadows to cover great distances quickly. Freedom fighters, who use this ability often, know the terrain of the Shadow World better than any other native creatures (except, perhaps, the <a href=\"/appendix/faerseel\">seelie faeries</a>)</p><p>Living in the eternal twilight of the Shadow World has caused all native varieties of halflings to develop infravision (out to 60 feet). </p><p>The most powerful halflings are those who have learned to use the Seeming to their benefit. Domain lords wield it to great effect and often use it to keep their subjects in line. They are not quite as good, however, at penetrating the illusions of others—their perceptions are skewed by years of seeing the world the way they want to see it and forcing it to conform to their wills.</p><p>Freedom fighters, by contrast, have had to learn to look past the Seeming in order to survive. They have not fully mastered manipulation of it (except those who once were slaves), but work to improve their understanding so they can use the Seeming toward more noble ends than do the domain lords. </p><p>Slaves, having grown up in a world permeated by the Seeming, possess a passing familiarity with it. They use their slight abilities as a means of escapism, a way to make their existences not quite so gloomy. Some domain lords turn a blind eye to the harmless illusions generated by slaves, such as the appearance of a feast to mask a meager meal. Others forbid use of any Seeming abilities, considering them a means of empowerment that must be denied on any level.</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Habitat/Society:</b> Once, halflings lived in pleasant, egalitarian, pastoral communities where they enjoyed the blessings of good food, warm hearths, and happy families. Now, however, the evil forces pervading the Shadow World have dramatically altered their existences. The life of a Shadow World halfling varies greatly according to what class he or she has fallen into (or chosen). And none know true peace.</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Domain Lords</b></p><p>As happens with any population that experiences wrenching changes in its environment, some halflings took advantage of the rise of evil in the Shadow World to grab authority for themselves. Corrupted by Azrai and his minions, these halflings climbed to power on the bodies of their brethren—in many cases, literally.</p><p>Domain lords rule Shadow World realms of their own, in much the same way Cerilian regents do. Some have landed domains, while others command trade. But unlike most Cerilian regents (at least, those respected by their subjects), the halfling lords of the Shadow World rule their domains as harsh dictatorships, using terror, intimidation, and violence to control their underlings. These tactics, once used out of fear of being overrun by the Shadow World's more powerful denizens, are now ingrained into the very nature of the halfling domain lords</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Slaves</b></p><p class=\"f\">Sadly, the majority of halflings left in the Shadow World are slaves. Some of them live under the corrupt regimes of the halfling domain lords, while some have been captured by other evil rulers and forced into servitude.</p><p>Halfling slaves live a silent, dreary existence. Their love of life has been beaten out of them, and the greatest goal they can imagine for themselves is simply to make it through another day without getting into trouble. They live in perpetual fear that somehow, without even knowing the means, they will incur the wrath—and the vengeance—of their cruel masters. </p><p class=\"f\"><b>Freedom Fighters</b></p><p class=\"f\">Freedom fighters live in small bands scattered throughout the Shadow World. They work to liberate their brethren from the bonds of servitude and overthrow the evil domain lords who betrayed their people.</p><p>Freedom fighters often infiltrate slave communities. There, over a period of months, they work to incite rebellion. Few uprisings are successful—most rebellious slaves end up dead—but those who do survive and escape typically join the ranks of the freedom fighters.</p><p>A few freedom fighters have become caretakers of havens. Newly freed slaves are brought to these places of safety. There, some train as warriors to join the resistance movement; others work to support the fighters in their own way (fashioning weapons, sewing clothes, cooking, and so on).</p><p>Though they know that evil pervades the world and extends far past the tyranny under which the slaves directly toil, freedom fighters realize that a handful of renegades acting alone can't effect much change in a world where the shadows grow longer every day. If an opportunity arises to join forces with other champions, they may agree to lend their strength to the cause of greater good. Their primary focus, however, is improving the lots of their own kind</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Ecology:</b> Domain lords gain their power by giving themselves over to the Cold Rider, worshipping him as a god. In exchange for their loyalty, he invests these followers with a seed of evil: a sliver of his own essence that takes the form of a tainted bloodline. </p><p>Domain lords believe the world belongs to them. They drain the land's already-challenged resources for their own ends, without a care for the future. </p><p>In the few areas of the Shadow World suitable for raising crops and livestock, slaves farm the land. Most of their harvest, however, goes to their masters. Slaves also perform for their lords other tasks that affect the environment, such as hunting, fishing, and clearing terrain.</p><p>Freedom fighters live off the land, using only what they need. The wasteful extravagance of the domain lords sickens them—part of the reason they believe the selfish dictators should be overthrown. </p><p>Shadow World halflings are, of course, related to Cerilian halflings. The two groups share little in common, however, except their ancestry. Those who left the Shadow World experience very different lives from those who stayed behind.</p>\n","images":["<img src=\"grf/br.gif\" width=\"150\" height=\"75\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Birthright\" title=\"Birthright\" align=\"right\">","<img src=\"grf/tsr_sm.png\" width=\"56\" height=\"59\" border=\"0\" alt=\"TSR\">"],"setting":"Birthright","statblock":{"Domain Lord":{"Activity Cycle":"Day","Alignment":"Lawful evil","Armor Class":"7 (10)","Blood Abilities":"(1) Long life, Persuasion, or Resistance","Bloodline":"Azrai, tainted","Climate/Terrain":"Woodlands, hills","Damage/Attack":"By weapon or spell","Diet":"Omnivore","Frequency":"Rare","Hit Dice":"6 (d6)","Intelligence":"Very (11-12)","Magic Resistance":"None","Morale":"Elite (13-14)","Movement":"6","No. Appearing":"1","No. of Attacks":"1","Organization":"Solitary","Perception/Seeming":"Lesser/Greater","Size":"S (4' tall)","Special Attacks":"Seeming","Special Defenses":"Seeming","THAC0":"18","Treasure":"W (G)","XP Value":"2,000"},"Freedom Fighter":{"Activity Cycle":"Nocturnal","Alignment":"Chaotic good","Armor Class":"7 (10)","Blood Abilities":"None","Bloodline":"None","Climate/Terrain":"Slave communities, forests","Damage/Attack":"By weapon","Diet":"Omnivore","Frequency":"Uncommon","Hit Dice":"4 (d6)","Intelligence":"High (13-14)","Magic Resistance":"None","Morale":"Champion (15-16)","Movement":"6","No. Appearing":"1-12","No. of Attacks":"1","Organization":"Band","Perception/Seeming":"Greater/Lesser","Size":"S (3'6\" tall)","Special Attacks":"Backstab, Seeming","Special Defenses":"Seeming","THAC0":"17","Treasure":"K, M (Px3, W)","XP Value":"650"},"Slave":{"Activity Cycle":"Day","Alignment":"Lawful neutral","Armor Class":"10","Blood Abilities":"None","Bloodline":"None","Climate/Terrain":"Slave communities","Damage/Attack":"1d4","Diet":"Omnivore","Frequency":"Common","Hit Dice":"1 (d6)","Intelligence":"Average (8-10)","Magic Resistance":"None","Morale":"Unsteady (5-7)","Movement":"6","No. Appearing":"1-10 (20-200)","No. of Attacks":"1","Organization":"Community","Perception/Seeming":"Slight/Slight","Size":"S (3' tall)","Special Attacks":"None","Special Defenses":"None","THAC0":"20","Treasure":"J (Ox3, Q)","XP Value":"65"}},"title":"Halfling, Shadow World"},"sources":["3140"],"statblock_names":[],"title":"Halfling, Shadow World","prev_key":"halfling","next_key":"halfrene","monster_path":"/appendix/halflisw"}},"staticQueryHashes":[],"slicesMap":{}}
