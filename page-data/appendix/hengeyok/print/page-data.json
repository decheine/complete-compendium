While the powers listed above are the most common, some aarakocra have different or additional powers.</p><p class=\"f\">A race of intelligent, birdlike creatures living in the deepest deserts of Athas, the rare Athasian <a href=\"/appendix/aarakocr\">aarakocra</a> spends its time soaring on thermals in search of food.</p><p>The aarakocra is 7 to 8 feet tall with a wingspan of 20 feet or more. Because of its large wingspan, an aarakocra can carry as much as 75% of its own body weight and still fly easily. An aarakocra can fly a short distance carrying a burden equaling 125% of its own body weight. The average body weight of a full grown male is 100 pounds and a female is 85 pounds.</p><p>Each wing has a &ldquo;hand&rdquo; at its midpoint, consisting of three fingers and an opposable thumb. The fourth finger forms the rigid leading edge of the wing. In flight the hands cannot be used, but on the ground the aarakocra can use its hands almost as a human would. The aarakocra's body is protected by a thin bony plate on the chest, much like a solid rib cage. Talons on its legs can be used as claws and can be retracted to reveal a second set of hands, also with three fingers and an opposable thumb. Except for the chest plate, the entire skeleton is hollow and extremely fragile.</p><p>From a distance, the Athasian aarakocra resembles a huge <a href=\"/appendix/bird\">vulture</a>. Its black eyes, set in the front of the head, provide excellent vision over a long range. The plumage is generally black with a white collar for adult males and black or brown with a smaller white collar for females. Adolescents are a mixture of brown and black. The beak is large and covers most of the head. Plumage begins at the crown of the head and is darker near the head, except for the collar. Athasian aarakocra speak their own language and the languages of vultures and other large birds. Some speak the common tongue (5% to 10% chance depending on how deep in the wastelands a tribe lives).</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Combat:</b> Aarakocra can fight in the air or on the ground. They prefer aerial combat since their bones are too fragile to withstand a solid blow from a human-sized opponent. In combat against creatures on the ground, they prefer to fly over their victim and drop weighted nets. Some aarakocra use darts to harass ground-based opponents.</p><p>If their opponents can fly, the aarakocra generally forgo the use of the net, although large groups sometimes use nets on flying creatures. Normally, aarakocra attack flying creatures with long spears, diving from above and allowing the momentum to carry the spear through the target. Such an attack doubles the damage if the aarakocra have been able to dive at least 50 feet. Only the very largest aarakocra can carry more than one of these spears, they can attack with both at once with no penalty, causing double damage on each strike. All diving attacks are made at +4 and should be treated as a charge attack. All other penalties and restrictions of charge attacks apply.</p><p>The effect of the aarakocra's nets depends on if the opponent is flying at the time it becomes entangled. Creatures on the ground that are hit by a net are entangled and unable to participate in any combat until they make a successful Strength check to get free of the net. Flying creatures hit by a net can no longer fly and immediately begin falling. If they cannot escape the net or use some magical means to arrest the fall, normal falling damage applies.</p><p>Unless victims are entangled in nets, aarakocra are cautious in ground combat. If the aarakocra outnumber their opponents they advance in a straight line and thrust with their spears. If outnumbered, or the opponents are particularly tough, the aarakocra withdraw. Victims entangled in nets are killed or incapacitated for use as food or ransom.</p><p>Athasian aarakocra are mindful of their physical limitations as well as their comparatively low psionic abilities. They do not normally initiate psionic combat. At the first sign of psionic powers from any of their victims, however, all aarakocra that have some ability will use whatever attack and defense modes they can in an attempt to destroy the threat. Large groups of is or more aarakocra may initiate psionic combat if their leaders feel they can win quickly and avoid physical combat.</p><p>In desperation, an aarakocra can attempt to bite an opponent in combat. Because of the unwieldiness of its beak, the aarakocra has a THAC0 of 18 if attacking with this appendage. Further, the birdman causes only 1d2 points of damage with the beak.</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Habitat/Society:</b> Athasian aarakocra live in tribes with 6-20 (2d8+4) members, depending on the prestige of the leader. The largest tribe ever recorded had 50 members. The tribal hunting territory depends on the size of the tribe, usually about 500 square miles for a tribe of 10 members. There are no rigid boundaries between tribes and border disputes are not uncommon.</p><p>Alignments of tribe members are similar to the alignment of the leader. A tribe that has a leader who is neutral good may have neutral good, chaotic good, lawful good, and true neutral members. A predominantly evil tribe does not recognize boundaries with other tribes and treats other tribes as inferior beings to be eliminated.</p><p>Athasian aarakocra aren't happy in enclosed spaces, but they they take refuge in a cave or building if necessary.</p><p>Nonevil tribes live in rocky aeries in the highest peaks they can find. Evil tribes are normally nomadic and use an aerie made by another tribe if they need to remain in an area for a long time, even if they have to evict the tribe that made the nest.</p><p>Aarakocra aren't friendly toward intruders in their territory, especially caravans. They try to extract a toll from the caravan for passage through the desert. Good-aligned tribes allow unhindered passage of caravans that pay a tribute. If someone refuses to pay the tribute, the aarakocra try to capture scouts or outriders from the party and hold them until an even larger tribute is paid. The payment may be either livestock or shiny objects. Aarakocra are smart enough not to be taken in by glass baubles instead of gems, although they cannot tell the difference between the more common gems and the rare ones.</p><p>Evil tribes ask for tribute and often attack a caravan whether it pays or not. Aarakocra always demand shiny objects such as stones. These tribes find humans and demihumans to be quite tasty and prefer them to other food.</p><p>Good-aligned tribes of aarakocra sometimes return a lost traveler to the edge of the desert after first removing any valuables the traveler may be carrying. On very rare occasions a tribe might return a lost group of travelers to the more frequently traveled parts of the desert, again after first taking any valuables as payment.</p><p>The oldest male is the leader of the tribal hunting party and has 4+4 Hit Dice. The oldest female is in charge of the tribal aerie and has 3+3 HD. In tribes that have more than 15 members, the next oldest aarakocra serves as shaman and has 3+3 HD; the shaman completes the triumvirate necessary for proper worship and the summoning of elementals. (Interestingly, no magic-using aarakocra has ever been recorded.) Tribes without a shaman cannot summon <a href=\"/appendix/element1\">air elementals</a>, which is an important part of aarakocra culture.</p><p>The shaman is the leader of the daily sun worship. Aarakocra worship the sun because it provides them with the thermals they need to soar in search of food. The shaman also leads the mystic rituals used to summon an air elemental. Summoning an air elemental is usually done only in preparation for the tribe's most sacred ceremony, the hunt. Small tribes must band together for this ceremony to allow the triumvirate to be formed.</p><p>The ceremony to summon an air elemental must be conducted at dawn and requires the oldest male and female to emit a highpitched keening whistle. The shaman conducts an intricate dance around them, simultaneously chanting an ancient summoning mantra.</p><p>The hunt is the final part of the initiation of adolescent aarakocra to adulthood and often takes the tribe far from their normal teritory. The target is always a <a href=\"/appendix/drakalsi\">silt drake</a>. The hunt is the only time the females leave the relative safety of the nest. Even an evil tribe will not interfere with a tribe on a hunt. An air elemental is often summoned to help find the drake, but never takes part in the actual combat. Although the adult members of the tribe take part in the initial phases of the combat, it is the initiates who deliver the final, killing blows to me drake. Scars from the hunt are considered a mark of pride among all aarakocra.</p><p>The females spend about eight months of the year incubating their eggs. Athasian aarakocra mate for life and a pair normally produces as many as 10 offspring. A female lays one egg a year. Constant incubation is not required because of the high daytime temperatures, so the females can maintain the nest and keep the tribe's treasure in order.</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Ecology:</b> Athasian aarakocra are high on the food chain and have no natural enemies other than <a href=\"/appendix/drakatha\">drakes</a>. Unless evil, aarakocra leave their own territory only to hunt the silt drake and return as soon as possible when the hunt is over. (Evil aarakocra attack others, as noted above.) Aarakocra eggs and hatchlings are sought after by wealthy land owners who wish to use the creatures as scouts and sentries. An egg can bring as much as 10 cp in Tyr's marketplace. Tribes that have had eggs or hatchlings stolen have long memories and sometimes take revenge against the thief at a later date. Captive aarakocra join any tribe they come in contact with.</p><p>Athasian aarakocra have a natural life span of 21-30 years.</p>\n","images":["<img src=\"grf/ds.gif\" width=\"150\" height=\"75\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Dark Sun\" title=\"Dark Sun\" align=\"right\">","<img src=\"img/aarakath.gif\" alt=\"Aarakocra (Athas)\" title=\"Aarakocra (Athas)\" border=\"0\" width=\"300\" height=\"360\" style=\"text-align:right;\" align=\"right\">","<img src=\"grf/add2_01.gif\" width=\"200\" height=\"56\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Advanced Dungeons & Dragons 2nd Edition\">"],"setting":"Dark Sun","statblock":{"Aarakocra (Athas)":{"Activity Cycle":"Day","Alignment":"Any","Armor Class":"7","Climate/Terrain":"Deep desert","Damage/Attack":"1d3/1d3 or by weapon","Diet":"Carnivore","Frequency":"Rare","Hit Dice":"2+2","Intelligence":"Average (8-10)","Magic Resistance":"Nil","Morale":"Steady (11)","Movement":"6, Fl 36 (C)","No. Appearing":"1d10","No. of Attacks":"2","Organization":"Tribal","Size":"M (20'+ wingspan)","Special Attacks":"Nil","Special Defenses":"Nil","THAC0":"17","Treasure":"Varies","XP Value":"65"}},"title":"Aarakocra (Athas)"},"sources":["2433"],"statblock_names":[],"title":"Aarakocra (Athas)","prev_key":"zygraat","next_key":"aarakocr","monster_path":"/appendix/aarakath"}}},"pageContext":{"monster_key":"hengeyok","monster_data":{"TSR":["2116"],"fullBody":"  <table cellspacing=\"0\" cellpadding=\"0\"><tr><th>Climate/Terrain:</th><td>Any</td></tr><tr><th>Frequency:</th><td>Uncommon</td></tr><tr><th>Organization:</th><td>Solitary or band</td></tr><tr><th>Activity Cycle:</th><td>Any</td></tr><tr><th>Diet:</th><td>Special</td></tr><tr><th>Intelligence:</th><td>Very to exceptional (12-15)</td></tr><tr><th>Treasure:</th><td>N,P</td></tr><tr><th>Alignment:</th><td>Varies (usually Chaotic good or evil)</td></tr><tr><th>No. Appearing:</th><td>1-20</td></tr><tr><th>Armor Class:</th><td>10 (as unarmored human or biped; see below for animal form)</td></tr><tr><th>Movement:</th><td>12 (as human or biped; see below for animal form)</td></tr><tr><th>Hit Dice:</th><td>1</td></tr><tr><th>THAC0:</th><td>20</td></tr><tr><th>No. of Attacks:</th><td>1</td></tr><tr><th>Damage/Attack:</th><td>By weapon (as human or biped; see below for animal form)</td></tr><tr><th>Special Attacks:</th><td>See below</td></tr><tr><th>Special Defenses:</th><td>See below</td></tr><tr><th>Magic Resistance:</th><td>Nil</td></tr><tr><th>Size:</th><td>Human or biped: M (5-6' tall)<br>Animal form: S (2-3' long)</td></tr><tr><th>Morale:</th><td>Elite (13)</td></tr><tr><th>XP Value:</th><td>420</td></tr></table><p class=\"f\">Hengeyokai are a race of intelligent shapechangers. Several subraces exist, each representing a different type of animal. Hengeyokai can be shukenja, kensai, bushi, or wu jen. They can never be samurai or ninja, since they are not human. The minimum and maximum ability requirements for a hengeyokai are summarized on a table below.</p><p>A hengeyokai can shapeshift between three different forms: animal, biped, and human. Each hengeyokai can assume only one animal form. The most common are carp, <a href=\"/appendix/catsmall\">cat</a>, crab, crane, <a href=\"/appendix/dog\">dog</a>, drake, <a href=\"/appendix/mammsmal\">fox</a>, hare, <a href=\"/appendix/mammsmal\">monkey</a>, raccoon dog, <a href=\"/appendix/rat\">rat</a>, and sparrow. Each animal form has its own alignment restrictions and special abilities; consult the Hengeyokai Creatures table below.</p><p>When in animal form, the hengeyokai is indistinguishable from normal animals of its kind. The change in form is genuine. Hence, the animal form appears normal and real to a caster who uses spells that reveal illusions.</p><p>When in bipedal form, the hengeyoki looks like a humanoid animal. He stands on his hind appendages to the height of a normal man. The front appendages (wings, paws, or fins) change into hands, capable of gripping and using normal weapons. The rest of the body retains the animal's general appearance, including fur, feathers, wings, a tail, and other characteristic features.</p><p>When in human form, the hengeyokai looks like a normal human being. Like his animal form, the human form is genuine and cannot be detected by spells that reveal illusions. However, the human form always retains one or more distinctive features of the animal form. For instance, a sparrow hengeyokai may have a pointed nose, and a rat hengeyokai may have beady eyes and long whiskers. (The DM determines such identifying features.)</p><p>Hengeyokai have their own language, which is the same regardless of their animal type. They can speak this language in all three of their forms. Additionally, hengeyokai can converse with normal animals and speak the trade language, as well as the languages of humans in the area. Hengeyokai only can speak human languages when in their human or bipedal forms.</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Combat:</b> The ability to shapechange is natural to hengeyokai. They are not <a href=\"/appendix/lycanthr\">lycanthropes</a>, and have none of the characteristics of lycanthropy. In other words, they are not limited by the cycles of the moon, are not especially susceptible to silver weapons, cannot transmit their power through wounds, and cannot heal their own wounds by simply changing form.</p><p>Each day, a hengeyokai can shapechange the number of times that equals his level. For instance, a 1st level hengeyokai can change from human to animal (or biped) only once in a given day. He must remain in that form until the next day, when he can shapechange again.</p><p>Changing form requires one complete round. The hengeyokai can take no other actions during that time. Armor and equipment do not change form; they simply drop to the ground. A hengeyokai has the same level and ability scores in each form. When he reaches 0 hit points in any form, he is slain. Total hit points vary between forms. In animal form, a hengeyokai has only half the total he has in human or bipedal form (rounded up). Hit points lost in one form are carried over point for point when the creature changes form. In other words, if a hengeyokai normally has 23 points as a human, he has a maximum of 12 in animal form. If he loses 8 points in human form, and stays in that form, his current total will be 15 (23 - 8 = 12). If he changes to animal form, his total will drop to 4 (12 - 8 = 4). If a hengeyokai would be reduced to 0 hit points (or less) when changing to animal form, he cannot make the change.</p><p>Each form has advantages and disadvantages:</p><p>In <i>animal form</i>, hengeyokai have the movement rate, Armor Class, and damage range shown on the Hengeyokai Creatures table below. They also gain infravision at a 120-foot range and acquire the ability to speak with normal animals. Conversations with normal animals are usually limited to a few simple phrases and concepts, depending on the sophistication of the animal.</p><p>The animal form has disadvantages, too. As noted above, a hengeyokai has only half his normal hit points when in animal form. He cannot wear armor, use weapons or equipment, or cast spells. He may be mistaken for - and hunted as - a normal animal. He cannot speak any languages other than those of the hengeyokai and normal animals, though he can understand any languages he knows.</p><p>In <i>bipedal form</i>, the hengeyokai can speak any language he knows (including human and animal languages), has infravision to a range of 120 feet, has his full number of hit points, can cast spells, and can use weapons, equipment, and armor.</p><p>However, the bipedal hengeyokai cannot use the special movement abilities of its animal form, regardless of its appearance. (For instance, a hengeyokai sparrow cannot fly in bipedal form, and a bipedal carp must use the normal swimming rules.) The movement rate for all bipedal hengeyokai is 12. Furthermore, the bipedal form is distinctive, and easily recognized as a hengeyokai.</p><p>In <i>human form</i>, the hengeyokai can cast spells, wear armor, and use weapons and equipment. He has his full number of hit points and can easily pass for a normal human being. However, he has no infravision and he cannot speak to animals, although he still can understand their speech.</p><p>A hengeyokai's choice of form depends on his situation:</p><ul><li>The animal form usually is used for reconnaissance and exploration rather than fighting, unless the animal form provides an especially advantageous attack or Armor Class. (For instance, if a dog hengeyokai in human form has neither arms nor armor, he probably would change to an animal to fight. As a dog, his AC is 9 and he can bite for 1-6 points of damage.)</li><li>The bipedal form is most natural for the hengeyokai. It also is preferred for intimidating opponents, as well as for its language and infravision capabilities.</li><li>The human form is most commonly used in combat. In this form, the hengeyokai attacks savagely and unrelentingly, shapeshifting to its animal form when necessary to escape from danger or to pursue a fleeing opponent.</li></ul><p class=\"f\"><b>Habitat/Society:</b> Hengeyokai are found throughout the world, usually on the fringes of human civilization. Hengeyokai do not form communities or villages of their own, preferring to form loosely organized bands, dwelling in crude but sturdy shelters made of wood and stone.</p><p>In general, the hengeyokai are a secretive race. They prefer to avoid prolonged contact with humans. Unlike most other races, hengeyokai do not form clans. They have little desire for land or position and never establish formal families or strongholds.</p><p>Hengeyokai of good alignment sometimes become protectors of human families or villages. As protectors, they assume the responsibilities of defending the area from outsiders and see to the general well-being of the inhabitants. In return, the hengeyokai receive offerings of food, gifts, and services from those they protect. Such offerings cover all the hengeyokai's needs.</p><p>The majority of hengeyokai are of chaotic alignment and form no associations with humans. Humans who dwell in the same area as a hengeyokai band usually are aware of the different animal forms this race may assume, as well as the usual alignment of each. The humans act accordingly. For instance, a fox hengeyokai is usually evil, so humans avoid it.</p><p>A typical hengeyokai band seldom consists of more than 20 adult members. Males and females are equal in number, as well as in abilities. The band includes one 2nd or 3rd level bushi (50% chance of either), who serves as the leader. The leader may be male or female. There is a 20% chance that a band includes a 1st or 2nd level shukenja, a 10% chance of a 1st or 2nd level wu jen, and a 10% chance of a 1st or 2nd level kensai. The remaining hengeyoaki are 1st level bushi. A few hengeyokai are bushi, shukenja, wu jen, and kensai of levels higher than those noted above. Such higher-level creatures seldom belong to a band, preferring to strike out on their own.</p><p>Hengeyokai have little use for material possessions, They rarely accumulate more than a few coins as treasure. Whatever else they acquire is usually exchanged for practical items, such as food or weapons, or given away to needy recipients.</p><p>Hengeyokai strive to make their lives as simple as possible. They enjoy storytelling, horticulture, and all forms of physical recreation such as swimming, running, and climbing. Though suspicious of strangers, they make deep and lasting friendships with those who treat them with kindness.</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Ecology:</b> The hengeyokai diet is similar to that of humans. However, they tend to eat foods associated with their animal forms. For instance, a cat hengeyokai may be a strict carnivore, while a sparrow hengeyokai may eat only seeds and grain.</p><p>Not many hengeyokai are artisans, but a few have natural artistic talent and exceptional skill. They are especially noted for their nishiki-e and beautifully carved kongi rikishi. The nishiki-e, colored woodcuts, have been known to fetch as much as 1,000 ch'ien from art collectors. Kongi rikishi are guardian figures mounted at the entrances of temples.</p><table class=\"ip\"><caption>Hengeyokai Creatures</caption><tr class=\"bk\"><th>Creature</th><th>Align.</th><th>Dmg</th><th>AC</th><th>MV</th><th>Modifications</th></tr><tr><td>Carp</td><td>Any good</td><td></td><td>7</td><td>Sw 12</td><td>+1 Wis, -1 Str</td></tr><tr><td>Cat</td><td>Any chaotic</td><td>1-3</td><td>9</td><td>12</td><td>-1 Dex, -1 Wis</td></tr><tr><td>Crab</td><td>Any</td><td>1-3</td><td>8</td><td>3, Sw 6</td><td>+2 Str, -2 Cha</td></tr><tr><td>Crane</td><td>Any good</td><td>1-2</td><td>9</td><td>6, Fl 12 (C)</td><td>+1 Wis, -1 Dex</td></tr><tr><td>Dog</td><td>Any good</td><td>1-6</td><td>9</td><td></td><td>+1 Con, -1 Int</td></tr><tr><td>Drake</td><td>Any good</td><td></td><td>7</td><td>Fl 12 (C), Sw 9</td><td>+1 Cha, -1 Dex</td></tr><tr><td>Fox</td><td>Any evil</td><td>1-3</td><td>6</td><td>15</td><td>+1 Int, -1 Wis</td></tr><tr><td>Hare</td><td>Any good</td><td></td><td>5</td><td>18</td><td>+1 Wis, -1 Str</td></tr><tr><td>Monkey</td><td>Any chaotic</td><td></td><td>6</td><td>12</td><td>+2 Dex, -2 Wis</td></tr><tr><td>Raccoon dog</td><td>Any evil</td><td>1-6</td><td>9</td><td>9</td><td>+2 Str, -2 Wis</td></tr><tr><td>Rat</td><td>Any evil</td><td>1-3</td><td>5</td><td></td><td>+2 Con, -2 Cha</td></tr><tr><td>Sparrow</td><td>Any good</td><td></td><td>3</td><td>3, Fl3 (C)</td><td>+2 Cha, -2 Con</td></tr></table><p class=\"ni\"><i>Notes</i><br><i>Alignment</i> requirements are strict, and apply all three of a hengeyokai's forms.<br><i>Damage (Dmg)</i> listings apply to animals with natural weapons, such as teeth or claws.
