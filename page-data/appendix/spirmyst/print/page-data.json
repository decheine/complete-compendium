While the powers listed above are the most common, some aarakocra have different or additional powers.</p><p class=\"f\">A race of intelligent, birdlike creatures living in the deepest deserts of Athas, the rare Athasian <a href=\"/appendix/aarakocr\">aarakocra</a> spends its time soaring on thermals in search of food.</p><p>The aarakocra is 7 to 8 feet tall with a wingspan of 20 feet or more. Because of its large wingspan, an aarakocra can carry as much as 75% of its own body weight and still fly easily. An aarakocra can fly a short distance carrying a burden equaling 125% of its own body weight. The average body weight of a full grown male is 100 pounds and a female is 85 pounds.</p><p>Each wing has a &ldquo;hand&rdquo; at its midpoint, consisting of three fingers and an opposable thumb. The fourth finger forms the rigid leading edge of the wing. In flight the hands cannot be used, but on the ground the aarakocra can use its hands almost as a human would. The aarakocra's body is protected by a thin bony plate on the chest, much like a solid rib cage. Talons on its legs can be used as claws and can be retracted to reveal a second set of hands, also with three fingers and an opposable thumb. Except for the chest plate, the entire skeleton is hollow and extremely fragile.</p><p>From a distance, the Athasian aarakocra resembles a huge <a href=\"/appendix/bird\">vulture</a>. Its black eyes, set in the front of the head, provide excellent vision over a long range. The plumage is generally black with a white collar for adult males and black or brown with a smaller white collar for females. Adolescents are a mixture of brown and black. The beak is large and covers most of the head. Plumage begins at the crown of the head and is darker near the head, except for the collar. Athasian aarakocra speak their own language and the languages of vultures and other large birds. Some speak the common tongue (5% to 10% chance depending on how deep in the wastelands a tribe lives).</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Combat:</b> Aarakocra can fight in the air or on the ground. They prefer aerial combat since their bones are too fragile to withstand a solid blow from a human-sized opponent. In combat against creatures on the ground, they prefer to fly over their victim and drop weighted nets. Some aarakocra use darts to harass ground-based opponents.</p><p>If their opponents can fly, the aarakocra generally forgo the use of the net, although large groups sometimes use nets on flying creatures. Normally, aarakocra attack flying creatures with long spears, diving from above and allowing the momentum to carry the spear through the target. Such an attack doubles the damage if the aarakocra have been able to dive at least 50 feet. Only the very largest aarakocra can carry more than one of these spears, they can attack with both at once with no penalty, causing double damage on each strike. All diving attacks are made at +4 and should be treated as a charge attack. All other penalties and restrictions of charge attacks apply.</p><p>The effect of the aarakocra's nets depends on if the opponent is flying at the time it becomes entangled. Creatures on the ground that are hit by a net are entangled and unable to participate in any combat until they make a successful Strength check to get free of the net. Flying creatures hit by a net can no longer fly and immediately begin falling. If they cannot escape the net or use some magical means to arrest the fall, normal falling damage applies.</p><p>Unless victims are entangled in nets, aarakocra are cautious in ground combat. If the aarakocra outnumber their opponents they advance in a straight line and thrust with their spears. If outnumbered, or the opponents are particularly tough, the aarakocra withdraw. Victims entangled in nets are killed or incapacitated for use as food or ransom.</p><p>Athasian aarakocra are mindful of their physical limitations as well as their comparatively low psionic abilities. They do not normally initiate psionic combat. At the first sign of psionic powers from any of their victims, however, all aarakocra that have some ability will use whatever attack and defense modes they can in an attempt to destroy the threat. Large groups of is or more aarakocra may initiate psionic combat if their leaders feel they can win quickly and avoid physical combat.</p><p>In desperation, an aarakocra can attempt to bite an opponent in combat. Because of the unwieldiness of its beak, the aarakocra has a THAC0 of 18 if attacking with this appendage. Further, the birdman causes only 1d2 points of damage with the beak.</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Habitat/Society:</b> Athasian aarakocra live in tribes with 6-20 (2d8+4) members, depending on the prestige of the leader. The largest tribe ever recorded had 50 members. The tribal hunting territory depends on the size of the tribe, usually about 500 square miles for a tribe of 10 members. There are no rigid boundaries between tribes and border disputes are not uncommon.</p><p>Alignments of tribe members are similar to the alignment of the leader. A tribe that has a leader who is neutral good may have neutral good, chaotic good, lawful good, and true neutral members. A predominantly evil tribe does not recognize boundaries with other tribes and treats other tribes as inferior beings to be eliminated.</p><p>Athasian aarakocra aren't happy in enclosed spaces, but they they take refuge in a cave or building if necessary.</p><p>Nonevil tribes live in rocky aeries in the highest peaks they can find. Evil tribes are normally nomadic and use an aerie made by another tribe if they need to remain in an area for a long time, even if they have to evict the tribe that made the nest.</p><p>Aarakocra aren't friendly toward intruders in their territory, especially caravans. They try to extract a toll from the caravan for passage through the desert. Good-aligned tribes allow unhindered passage of caravans that pay a tribute. If someone refuses to pay the tribute, the aarakocra try to capture scouts or outriders from the party and hold them until an even larger tribute is paid. The payment may be either livestock or shiny objects. Aarakocra are smart enough not to be taken in by glass baubles instead of gems, although they cannot tell the difference between the more common gems and the rare ones.</p><p>Evil tribes ask for tribute and often attack a caravan whether it pays or not. Aarakocra always demand shiny objects such as stones. These tribes find humans and demihumans to be quite tasty and prefer them to other food.</p><p>Good-aligned tribes of aarakocra sometimes return a lost traveler to the edge of the desert after first removing any valuables the traveler may be carrying. On very rare occasions a tribe might return a lost group of travelers to the more frequently traveled parts of the desert, again after first taking any valuables as payment.</p><p>The oldest male is the leader of the tribal hunting party and has 4+4 Hit Dice. The oldest female is in charge of the tribal aerie and has 3+3 HD. In tribes that have more than 15 members, the next oldest aarakocra serves as shaman and has 3+3 HD; the shaman completes the triumvirate necessary for proper worship and the summoning of elementals. (Interestingly, no magic-using aarakocra has ever been recorded.) Tribes without a shaman cannot summon <a href=\"/appendix/element1\">air elementals</a>, which is an important part of aarakocra culture.</p><p>The shaman is the leader of the daily sun worship. Aarakocra worship the sun because it provides them with the thermals they need to soar in search of food. The shaman also leads the mystic rituals used to summon an air elemental. Summoning an air elemental is usually done only in preparation for the tribe's most sacred ceremony, the hunt. Small tribes must band together for this ceremony to allow the triumvirate to be formed.</p><p>The ceremony to summon an air elemental must be conducted at dawn and requires the oldest male and female to emit a highpitched keening whistle. The shaman conducts an intricate dance around them, simultaneously chanting an ancient summoning mantra.</p><p>The hunt is the final part of the initiation of adolescent aarakocra to adulthood and often takes the tribe far from their normal teritory. The target is always a <a href=\"/appendix/drakalsi\">silt drake</a>. The hunt is the only time the females leave the relative safety of the nest. Even an evil tribe will not interfere with a tribe on a hunt. An air elemental is often summoned to help find the drake, but never takes part in the actual combat. Although the adult members of the tribe take part in the initial phases of the combat, it is the initiates who deliver the final, killing blows to me drake. Scars from the hunt are considered a mark of pride among all aarakocra.</p><p>The females spend about eight months of the year incubating their eggs. Athasian aarakocra mate for life and a pair normally produces as many as 10 offspring. A female lays one egg a year. Constant incubation is not required because of the high daytime temperatures, so the females can maintain the nest and keep the tribe's treasure in order.</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Ecology:</b> Athasian aarakocra are high on the food chain and have no natural enemies other than <a href=\"/appendix/drakatha\">drakes</a>. Unless evil, aarakocra leave their own territory only to hunt the silt drake and return as soon as possible when the hunt is over. (Evil aarakocra attack others, as noted above.) Aarakocra eggs and hatchlings are sought after by wealthy land owners who wish to use the creatures as scouts and sentries. An egg can bring as much as 10 cp in Tyr's marketplace. Tribes that have had eggs or hatchlings stolen have long memories and sometimes take revenge against the thief at a later date. Captive aarakocra join any tribe they come in contact with.</p><p>Athasian aarakocra have a natural life span of 21-30 years.</p><br clear=\"all\" style=\"clear:both; height:0;\">\r\n","images":["<img src=\"grf/ds.gif\" width=\"150\" height=\"75\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Dark Sun\" title=\"Dark Sun\" align=\"right\">","<img src=\"img/aarakath.gif\" alt=\"Aarakocra (Athas)\" title=\"Aarakocra (Athas)\" border=\"0\" width=\"300\" height=\"360\" style=\"text-align:right;\" align=\"right\">","<img src=\"grf/add2_01.gif\" width=\"200\" height=\"56\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Advanced Dungeons & Dragons 2nd Edition\">"],"setting":"Dark Sun","statblock":{"Aarakocra (Athas)":{"Activity Cycle":"Day","Alignment":"Any","Armor Class":"7","Climate/Terrain":"Deep desert","Damage/Attack":"1d3/1d3 or by weapon","Diet":"Carnivore","Frequency":"Rare","Hit Dice":"2+2","Intelligence":"Average (8-10)","Magic Resistance":"Nil","Morale":"Steady (11)","Movement":"6, Fl 36 (C)","No. Appearing":"1d10","No. of Attacks":"2","Organization":"Tribal","Size":"M (20'+ wingspan)","Special Attacks":"Nil","Special Defenses":"Nil","THAC0":"17","Treasure":"Varies","XP Value":"65"}},"title":"Aarakocra (Athas)"},"sources":["2433"],"statblock_names":[],"title":"Aarakocra (Athas)","prev_key":"zygraat","next_key":"aarakocr","monster_path":"/appendix/aarakath"}}},"pageContext":{"monster_key":"spirmyst","monster_data":{"TSR":["2501"],"fullBody":"  <table cellspacing=\"0\" cellpadding=\"0\"><tr class=\"bk\"><th> </th><th class=\"cn\">Druj</th><th class=\"cn\">Odic</th></tr><tr><th>Climate/Terrain:</th><td>Any</td><td>Any non-desert land</td></tr><tr><th>Frequency:</th><td>Very rare</td><td>Very rare</td></tr><tr><th>Organization:</th><td>Solitary</td><td>Solitary</td></tr><tr><th>Activity Cycle:</th><td>Night</td><td>Night</td></tr><tr><th>Diet:</th><td>None</td><td>None</td></tr><tr><th>Intelligence:</th><td>High (13-14)</td><td>Very (11-12)</td></tr><tr><th>Treasure:</th><td>Nil (H)</td><td>Nil (H)</td></tr><tr><th>Alignment:</th><td>Neutral evil</td><td>Neutral evil</td></tr><tr><th>No. Appearing:</th><td>1</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><th>Armor Class:</th><td>-4</td><td>-4</td></tr><tr><th>Movement:</th><td>Fl 9 (A)</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><th>Hit Dice:</th><td>14</td><td>16</td></tr><tr><th>THAC0:</th><td>7</td><td>5</td></tr><tr><th>No. of Attacks:</th><td>1 or 4</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><th>Damage/Attack:</th><td>Eye: Nil<br>Hand: 1d4 (strike)<br>Skull: 1d6 (bite)</td><td>1d12 (branch)</td></tr><tr><th>Special Attacks:</th><td>Poison touch, spells (paralysis)</td><td>Poison touch, spells, charm, energy drain</td></tr><tr><th>Special Defenses:</th><td>Animate dead, immune to some spells</td><td>Animate dead, immune to some spells</td></tr><tr><th>Magic Resistance:</th><td>Nil</td><td>Nil</td></tr><tr><th>Size:</th><td>T (varies)</td><td>M (varies)</td></tr><tr><th>Morale:</th><td>Fearless (20)</td><td>Fearless (20)</td></tr><tr><th>XP Value:</th><td>16,000</td><td>22,000</td></tr></table><p class=\"f\">Spirits are powerful undead beings which inhabit the bodies, or body parts, of others. Creatures or parts of creatures animated by a spirit have a pale, decayed appearance and often emit a sickly green, blue, or purple glow. Though solitary, a druj or odic may be found in the company of 1d6 of its victims.</p><p>Druj appear as body parts - a hand, an eye, or a skull - floating or crawling around in a horrible way.</p><p>Odics are formless creatures that take possession of normal plants, usually shrubs or small trees.</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Combat:</b> Being undead, spirits are immune to <i>sleep</i>, <i>charm</i>, and <i>hold</i> spells. They cannot be paralysed or poisoned, nor are they harmed by cold-based attacks.</p><p>All spirits are poisonous; a melee hit from a spirit causes the target to make a successful saving throw vs. poison or die immediately. Furthermore, a spirit's poisonous aura causes all consumable items within a 30-foot radius to instantly become spoiled and useless: all food (including iron rations), water, beverages, holy water, and magical potions, salves, and oils become spoiled. There is no saving throw against this power, though items within a closed extradimensional space, such as a <i>bag of holding</i>, are immune. If the container is opened even for a moment while within range, however, the consumable items inside become spoiled. Suppies that are spoiled by this power do not become poisonous, but thev lose all magical properties and acquire a fdul taste. Spoiled food and drink, if consumed, provide no benefits whatsoever. Normal items can be made wholesome again with a <i>purify food and drink</i> spell, though they never quite lose their foul taste. Magical items and holy water can be restored only by a <i>wish</i> or <i>limited wish</i>.</p><p>Living plants and normal insects within the poison radius become immediately paralyzed and die if the spirit remains in the area for more than an hour. This effect negates all forms of plant control (including <i>entangle</i> spells) and all insect plagues and swarms, both normal and magical.</p><p>Spirits continually use a form of <i>detect invisibility</i>, and they can use any of the following spell-like abilities once a round, at will, as a 16th-level priest: <i>darkness</i>, <i>silence 15' radius</i>, <i>cause disease</i>, <i>animate dead</i>, and <i>finger of death</i>.</p><p>Spirits frequently use their <i>animate dead</i> ability to turn victims they have slain into <a href=\"/appendix/zombie\">zombies</a>, which the spirit uses to defend itself and to harass enemies. Both the spirit itself and the zombies under its control can be turned by priests and paladins as special creatures.</p><p>All spirits are powerless during daylight, although they can move up to 24 miles between sunrise and sunset.</p><p><b class=\"bk\">Druj Combat</b></p><p>Once a night, a druj can split its essence, creating four identical forms. Each of these forms is poisonous, and each can attack separately; however, only one retains the druj's spell-like powers. Opponents often can identify which is the spellcasting form, as it tends to hover in the background while the other three close to attack. Should the spell-casting form be destroyed, one of the surviving forms immediately gains all the druj's spell-like abilities. Only destroying all four forms will defeat the creature.</p><p>The first time each night that a druj is successfully turned by a priest or paladin, the spirit's forms are forced to reunite into one creature and remain that way for 1d4+1 rounds, after which the druj can split again. Similarly, if the druj is turned before it can split, it cannot then do so until 1d4+1 rounds have passed. In either case, further successful turns during the same night are handled normally - that is, they force the entire creature to retreat.</p><p>Druj have additional powers, depending on their basic forms.</p><p><i>Eye:</i> An eye druj darts about, trying to touch its opponents. The touch inflicts no damage, other than poisoning. An eye druj can make a special gaze attack against one target each round in addition to its physical attacks. The victim must make a successful saving throw vs. paralysis or be paralyzed for 1d4 turns. This attack has a range of 30 feet, and the victim need not meet the druj's gaze to be affected. An eye druj can automatically touch a paralyzed victim.</p><p><i>Hand:</i> A hand druj inflicts 1d4 points of damage when it strikes a creature; it holds on thereafter, causing additional damage each round. The damage inflicted by the hold is 1d4 points plus the victim's Armor Chss (shield and Dexterity adjustments do not apply). Even if the character's base Armor Class is 0 or less, he or she still suffers 1d4 points of damage per round. The victim must roll a saving throw vs. poison only when initially struck by the hand.</p><p><i>Skull:</i> A skull druj floats toward its victims, attempting to bite; each bite inflicts 2d4 points of damage and causes the victim to make a successful saving throw vs. poison or die. When first attacked, a victim must make a successful saving throw vs. spell or be frozen with fright for one round. The druj can automatically bite a frozen victim.</p><p><b class=\"bk\">Odic Combat</b></p><p>This spirit possesses a new plant each night. The plant sheds a purplish or bluish light in a 20-foot radius; this light is visible up to 300 yards away. Living creatures entering the light must make a successful saving throw vs. spell or they lose one level or Hit Die, as though struck by a <a href=\"/appendix/wight\">wight</a>. Each potential victim must make an additional saving throw each round he or she remains in the light.</p><p>Once it has settled in for the night, an odic cannot move from the spot until daybreak. The host plant is killed immediately. The odic can animate parts of the plant, however, and use them to deliver its attacks.</p><p>The odic uses the plant's longest branch to reach out up to 30 feet and deliver a blow that inflicts 1d12 points of damage; anyone struck must also make a saving throw vs. poison or perish.</p><p>The odic uses other portions of the host to seek out victims. The odic can animate up to six leaves at one time. These animated leaves float away at a movement rate of 3; the odic can control them at any range up to one mile. The animated leaves have a THAC0 of 16 and an Armor Class of 8; because they are barely noticeable, they impose a 4 penalty on their opponenents' surprise rolls. They have one hit point each. They inflict no damage, but any victim touched by one must make a successful saving throw vs. spell or be <i>charmed</i> and drawn toward the odic. Charmed victims who enter the odic's light suffer a -4 penalty to saving throws against the energy drain and will not voluntarily leave the radius.</p><p>If the host plant has no leaves, the odic can animate the nearest equivalent - needles, flowers, tendrils, etc. During a single night, an odic can animate any number of leaves the host plant has available; however, the odic can never animate more than six at once. Animated leaves cannot use the odic's spell-like powers or poison touch.</p><p>Animated leaves can be turned as special undead. If successfully turned, their link with the controlling odic is broken and the leaves fall to the ground, inert. The odic cannot reanimate a leaf once it has been turned, but it can continue to animate other leaves from the host plant.</p><p>If the odic itself is turned, it is forced out of the host plant and becomes helpless until the next sunset, when it can possess a new plant.</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Habitat/Society:</b> Spirits are solitary wanderers. They usually cany no treasure but occasionally serve as guardians for special items or hoards. Also, a spirit's previous victims, if present, might carry type H treasure.</p><p>Druj are always encountered singly unless commanded by powerful <a href=\"/appendix/lich\">lich</a>, evil priest, or similar evil power. In such cases, two druj eyes might rest within a druj skull, accompanied by two druj hands. No more that these five druj can ever be found in one place, and smaller groups (a druj skull with one druj eye, for example) are much more likely.</p><p>Odics are always encountered singly. Occasionally, odics inhabit the bodies of plantlike monsters. The monster is allowed a saving throw vs. spell, and if it succeeds the odic cannot attempt to possess the monster again that night. However, the odic can still settle into a nearby plant and attack the monster using its normal abilities.</p><p>Possession by an odic kills a plantlike monster, just as it kills normal plants. If the possessed creature is mobile, the odic can then move at the creature's normal movement rate. The odic can also use all of the monster's powers in addition to its own.</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Ecology:</b> Like most undead, these spirits hate life and ruthlessly seek to destroy it whenever possible. It may be that spirits gain sustenance from the life forces of the creatures they slay, but hunger clearly is not their only motivation. As destructive as they are, spirits usually move on before they can cause any great local impact. Should one decide to settle down, however, the effects are disastrous, as a spirit tends to kill everything in its vicinity.</p><br clear=\"all\" style=\"clear:both; height:0;\">\r\n","images":["<img src=\"grf/ms.gif\" width=\"150\" height=\"75\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Mystara\" title=\"Mystara\" align=\"right\">","<img src=\"img/spirmyst.gif\" alt=\"Spirit (Mystara)\" title=\"Spirit (Mystara)\" border=\"0\" width=\"300\" height=\"360\" style=\"text-align:right;\" align=\"right\">","<img src=\"grf/add2_01.gif\" width=\"200\" height=\"56\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Advanced Dungeons & Dragons 2nd Edition\">"],"setting":"Mystara","statblock":{"Druj":{"Activity Cycle":"Night","Alignment":"Neutral evil","Armor Class":"-4","Climate/Terrain":"Any","Damage/Attack":"Eye: Nil<br>Hand: 1d4 (strike)<br>Skull: 1d6 (bite)","Diet":"None","Frequency":"Very rare","Hit Dice":"14","Intelligence":"High (13-14)","Magic Resistance":"Nil","Morale":"Fearless (20)","Movement":"Fl 9 (A)","No. Appearing":"1","No. of Attacks":"1 or 4","Organization":"Solitary","Size":"T (varies)","Special Attacks":"Poison touch, spells (paralysis)","Special Defenses":"Animate dead, immune to some spells","THAC0":"7","Treasure":"Nil (H)","XP Value":"16,000"},"Odic":{"Activity Cycle":"Night","Alignment":"Neutral evil","Armor Class":"-4","Climate/Terrain":"Any non-desert land","Damage/Attack":"1d12 (branch)","Diet":"None","Frequency":"Very rare","Hit Dice":"16","Intelligence":"Very (11-12)","Magic Resistance":"Nil","Morale":"Fearless (20)","Movement":"0","No. Appearing":"1","No. of Attacks":"1","Organization":"Solitary","Size":"M (varies)","Special Attacks":"Poison touch, spells, charm, energy drain","Special Defenses":"Animate dead, immune to some spells","THAC0":"5","Treasure":"Nil (H)","XP Value":"22,000"}},"title":"Spirit (Mystara)"},"sources":["2501"],"statblock_names":[],"title":"Spirit (Mystara)","prev_key":"spirijam","next_key":"spirnatu","monster_path":"/appendix/spirmyst"}},"staticQueryHashes":[],"slicesMap":{}}
