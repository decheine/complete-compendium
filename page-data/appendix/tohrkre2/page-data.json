While the powers listed above are the most common, some aarakocra have different or additional powers.</p><p class=\"f\">A race of intelligent, birdlike creatures living in the deepest deserts of Athas, the rare Athasian <a href=\"/appendix/aarakocr\">aarakocra</a> spends its time soaring on thermals in search of food.</p><p>The aarakocra is 7 to 8 feet tall with a wingspan of 20 feet or more. Because of its large wingspan, an aarakocra can carry as much as 75% of its own body weight and still fly easily. An aarakocra can fly a short distance carrying a burden equaling 125% of its own body weight. The average body weight of a full grown male is 100 pounds and a female is 85 pounds.</p><p>Each wing has a &ldquo;hand&rdquo; at its midpoint, consisting of three fingers and an opposable thumb. The fourth finger forms the rigid leading edge of the wing. In flight the hands cannot be used, but on the ground the aarakocra can use its hands almost as a human would. The aarakocra's body is protected by a thin bony plate on the chest, much like a solid rib cage. Talons on its legs can be used as claws and can be retracted to reveal a second set of hands, also with three fingers and an opposable thumb. Except for the chest plate, the entire skeleton is hollow and extremely fragile.</p><p>From a distance, the Athasian aarakocra resembles a huge <a href=\"/appendix/bird\">vulture</a>. Its black eyes, set in the front of the head, provide excellent vision over a long range. The plumage is generally black with a white collar for adult males and black or brown with a smaller white collar for females. Adolescents are a mixture of brown and black. The beak is large and covers most of the head. Plumage begins at the crown of the head and is darker near the head, except for the collar. Athasian aarakocra speak their own language and the languages of vultures and other large birds. Some speak the common tongue (5% to 10% chance depending on how deep in the wastelands a tribe lives).</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Combat:</b> Aarakocra can fight in the air or on the ground. They prefer aerial combat since their bones are too fragile to withstand a solid blow from a human-sized opponent. In combat against creatures on the ground, they prefer to fly over their victim and drop weighted nets. Some aarakocra use darts to harass ground-based opponents.</p><p>If their opponents can fly, the aarakocra generally forgo the use of the net, although large groups sometimes use nets on flying creatures. Normally, aarakocra attack flying creatures with long spears, diving from above and allowing the momentum to carry the spear through the target. Such an attack doubles the damage if the aarakocra have been able to dive at least 50 feet. Only the very largest aarakocra can carry more than one of these spears, they can attack with both at once with no penalty, causing double damage on each strike. All diving attacks are made at +4 and should be treated as a charge attack. All other penalties and restrictions of charge attacks apply.</p><p>The effect of the aarakocra's nets depends on if the opponent is flying at the time it becomes entangled. Creatures on the ground that are hit by a net are entangled and unable to participate in any combat until they make a successful Strength check to get free of the net. Flying creatures hit by a net can no longer fly and immediately begin falling. If they cannot escape the net or use some magical means to arrest the fall, normal falling damage applies.</p><p>Unless victims are entangled in nets, aarakocra are cautious in ground combat. If the aarakocra outnumber their opponents they advance in a straight line and thrust with their spears. If outnumbered, or the opponents are particularly tough, the aarakocra withdraw. Victims entangled in nets are killed or incapacitated for use as food or ransom.</p><p>Athasian aarakocra are mindful of their physical limitations as well as their comparatively low psionic abilities. They do not normally initiate psionic combat. At the first sign of psionic powers from any of their victims, however, all aarakocra that have some ability will use whatever attack and defense modes they can in an attempt to destroy the threat. Large groups of is or more aarakocra may initiate psionic combat if their leaders feel they can win quickly and avoid physical combat.</p><p>In desperation, an aarakocra can attempt to bite an opponent in combat. Because of the unwieldiness of its beak, the aarakocra has a THAC0 of 18 if attacking with this appendage. Further, the birdman causes only 1d2 points of damage with the beak.</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Habitat/Society:</b> Athasian aarakocra live in tribes with 6-20 (2d8+4) members, depending on the prestige of the leader. The largest tribe ever recorded had 50 members. The tribal hunting territory depends on the size of the tribe, usually about 500 square miles for a tribe of 10 members. There are no rigid boundaries between tribes and border disputes are not uncommon.</p><p>Alignments of tribe members are similar to the alignment of the leader. A tribe that has a leader who is neutral good may have neutral good, chaotic good, lawful good, and true neutral members. A predominantly evil tribe does not recognize boundaries with other tribes and treats other tribes as inferior beings to be eliminated.</p><p>Athasian aarakocra aren't happy in enclosed spaces, but they they take refuge in a cave or building if necessary.</p><p>Nonevil tribes live in rocky aeries in the highest peaks they can find. Evil tribes are normally nomadic and use an aerie made by another tribe if they need to remain in an area for a long time, even if they have to evict the tribe that made the nest.</p><p>Aarakocra aren't friendly toward intruders in their territory, especially caravans. They try to extract a toll from the caravan for passage through the desert. Good-aligned tribes allow unhindered passage of caravans that pay a tribute. If someone refuses to pay the tribute, the aarakocra try to capture scouts or outriders from the party and hold them until an even larger tribute is paid. The payment may be either livestock or shiny objects. Aarakocra are smart enough not to be taken in by glass baubles instead of gems, although they cannot tell the difference between the more common gems and the rare ones.</p><p>Evil tribes ask for tribute and often attack a caravan whether it pays or not. Aarakocra always demand shiny objects such as stones. These tribes find humans and demihumans to be quite tasty and prefer them to other food.</p><p>Good-aligned tribes of aarakocra sometimes return a lost traveler to the edge of the desert after first removing any valuables the traveler may be carrying. On very rare occasions a tribe might return a lost group of travelers to the more frequently traveled parts of the desert, again after first taking any valuables as payment.</p><p>The oldest male is the leader of the tribal hunting party and has 4+4 Hit Dice. The oldest female is in charge of the tribal aerie and has 3+3 HD. In tribes that have more than 15 members, the next oldest aarakocra serves as shaman and has 3+3 HD; the shaman completes the triumvirate necessary for proper worship and the summoning of elementals. (Interestingly, no magic-using aarakocra has ever been recorded.) Tribes without a shaman cannot summon <a href=\"/appendix/element1\">air elementals</a>, which is an important part of aarakocra culture.</p><p>The shaman is the leader of the daily sun worship. Aarakocra worship the sun because it provides them with the thermals they need to soar in search of food. The shaman also leads the mystic rituals used to summon an air elemental. Summoning an air elemental is usually done only in preparation for the tribe's most sacred ceremony, the hunt. Small tribes must band together for this ceremony to allow the triumvirate to be formed.</p><p>The ceremony to summon an air elemental must be conducted at dawn and requires the oldest male and female to emit a highpitched keening whistle. The shaman conducts an intricate dance around them, simultaneously chanting an ancient summoning mantra.</p><p>The hunt is the final part of the initiation of adolescent aarakocra to adulthood and often takes the tribe far from their normal teritory. The target is always a <a href=\"/appendix/drakalsi\">silt drake</a>. The hunt is the only time the females leave the relative safety of the nest. Even an evil tribe will not interfere with a tribe on a hunt. An air elemental is often summoned to help find the drake, but never takes part in the actual combat. Although the adult members of the tribe take part in the initial phases of the combat, it is the initiates who deliver the final, killing blows to me drake. Scars from the hunt are considered a mark of pride among all aarakocra.</p><p>The females spend about eight months of the year incubating their eggs. Athasian aarakocra mate for life and a pair normally produces as many as 10 offspring. A female lays one egg a year. Constant incubation is not required because of the high daytime temperatures, so the females can maintain the nest and keep the tribe's treasure in order.</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Ecology:</b> Athasian aarakocra are high on the food chain and have no natural enemies other than <a href=\"/appendix/drakatha\">drakes</a>. Unless evil, aarakocra leave their own territory only to hunt the silt drake and return as soon as possible when the hunt is over. (Evil aarakocra attack others, as noted above.) Aarakocra eggs and hatchlings are sought after by wealthy land owners who wish to use the creatures as scouts and sentries. An egg can bring as much as 10 cp in Tyr's marketplace. Tribes that have had eggs or hatchlings stolen have long memories and sometimes take revenge against the thief at a later date. Captive aarakocra join any tribe they come in contact with.</p><p>Athasian aarakocra have a natural life span of 21-30 years.</p><p></p><br clear=\"all\" style=\"clear:both; height:0;\">\r\n","images":["<img src=\"grf/ds.gif\" width=\"150\" height=\"75\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Dark Sun\" title=\"Dark Sun\" align=\"right\">","<img src=\"img/aarakath.gif\" alt=\"Aarakocra (Athas)\" title=\"Aarakocra (Athas)\" border=\"0\" width=\"300\" height=\"360\" style=\"text-align:right;\" align=\"right\">","<img src=\"grf/add2_01.gif\" width=\"200\" height=\"56\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Advanced Dungeons & Dragons 2nd Edition\">"],"setting":"Dark Sun","statblock":{"Aarakocra (Athas)":{"Activity Cycle":"Day","Alignment":"Any","Armor Class":"7","Climate/Terrain":"Deep desert","Damage/Attack":"1d3/1d3 or by weapon","Diet":"Carnivore","Frequency":"Rare","Hit Dice":"2+2","Intelligence":"Average (8-10)","Magic Resistance":"Nil","Morale":"Steady (11)","Movement":"6, Fl 36 (C)","No. Appearing":"1d10","No. of Attacks":"2","Organization":"Tribal","Size":"M (20'+ wingspan)","Special Attacks":"Nil","Special Defenses":"Nil","THAC0":"17","Treasure":"Varies","XP Value":"65"}},"title":"Aarakocra (Athas)"},"sources":["2433"],"statblock_names":[],"title":"Aarakocra (Athas)","prev_key":"zygraat","next_key":"aarakocr","monster_path":"/appendix/aarakath"}}},"pageContext":{"monster_key":"tohrkre2","monster_data":{"TSR":["2433"],"fullBody":"  <table cellspacing=\"0\" cellpadding=\"0\"><tr class=\"bk\"><th> </th><th class=\"cn\">J'ez</th><th class=\"cn\">J'hol</th></tr><tr><th>Climate/Terrain:</th><td>Any land</td><td>Any land</td></tr><tr><th>Frequency:</th><td>Common in the North, very rare elsewhere</td><td>Common in the North, very rare elsewhere</td></tr><tr><th>Organization:</th><td>Clutch and state</td><td>Clutch and state</td></tr><tr><th>Activity Cycle:</th><td>Constant</td><td>Constant</td></tr><tr><th>Diet:</th><td>Carnivore</td><td>Carnivore</td></tr><tr><th>Intelligence:</th><td>Average to genius (8-18)</td><td>Average to excentional (8-16)</td></tr><tr><th>Treasure:</th><td>U (see below)</td><td>U (see below)</td></tr><tr><th>Alignment:</th><td>Any lawful</td><td>Any non-good</td></tr><tr><th>No. Appearing:</th><td>3d12</td><td>3d10</td></tr><tr><th>Armor Class:</th><td>5</td><td>5</td></tr><tr><th>Movement:</th><td>18</td><td>18</td></tr><tr><th>Hit Dice:</th><td>6+3</td><td>6+3</td></tr><tr><th>THAC0:</th><td>13</td><td>13</td></tr><tr><th>No. of Attacks:</th><td>5 or 2</td><td>5 or 2</td></tr><tr><th>Damage/Attack:</th><td>1d3 (&times;4)/1d6+1 or 1d6+1 and by weapon</td><td>1d4 (&times;4)/1d4+1 or 1d4+1 and by weapon</td></tr><tr><th>Special Attacks:</th><td>Paralyzation</td><td>Leap</td></tr><tr><th>Special Defenses:</th><td>Missile dodge</td><td>Missile dodge</td></tr><tr><th>Magic Resistance:</th><td>Nil</td><td>Nil</td></tr><tr><th>Size:</th><td>L (9' long)</td><td>M (6' tall)</td></tr><tr><th>Morale:</th><td>Champion (15-16)</td><td>Fanatic (17-18)</td></tr><tr><th>XP Value:</th><td>1,400</td><td>1,400</td></tr></table><p class=\"f\"><a href=\"/appendix/tohrkre1\">Tohr-kreen</a> are large, intelligent insects, very similar to <a href=\"/appendix/thrikree\">thri-kreen</a>. Tohr-kreen build permanent settlements in the lands far to the north of the Tablelands, home to Tyr and the other humanoid city-states. For many years, the tohr-kreen have sent scouts to the Tyr region These scouts are called <i>zik-trin'ta</i> by other tohr-kreen, but are known as tohr-kreen to the peoples of the Tablelands.</p><p>The most common tohr-kreen of the north are the j'ez, who have black chitin, and the j'hol, who are smaller and have red chitin. Members of both species have aggressive natures. Both are similar in most ways to thri-kreen.</p><h2>J'ez Tohr-kreen</h2><p class=\"f\">The figures given above are for mature adult j'ez. Others have the following abilities, based on their age (they age one age category every two years until they reach mature adult):</p><table class=\"ip\"><tr class=\"bk\"><th></th><th>HD</th><th>THAC0</th><th>XP</th><th>Claw/bite Damage</th><th>Special Ability</th></tr><tr><td>Larva</td><td>1+3</td><td>19</td><td>65</td><td>1/1d2</td><td>-</td></tr><tr><td>Child</td><td>2+3</td><td>17</td><td>120</td><td>1/1d3</td><td>-</td></tr><tr><td>Young</td><td>3+3</td><td>17</td><td>175</td><td>1d3/1d4</td><td>leap</td></tr><tr><td>Young adult</td><td>4+3</td><td>15</td><td>270</td><td>1d3/1d6</td><td>venom</td></tr><tr><td>Adult</td><td>5+3</td><td>15</td><td>975</td><td>1d4/1d6+1</td><td>chatkcha</td></tr><tr><td>Mature adult</td><td>6+3</td><td>13</td><td>1,400</td><td>1d4/1d6+1</td><td>dodge missiles</td></tr></table><p>J'ez have black chitin and four-fingered hands. Skin stretches over their chitin and they have long antennae. J'ez also have mouths that are odd for kreen. The general arrangement is circular, and the j'ez have inward-pointing fanglike parts around the circumference of their relatively flexible mouths. Extensions reach from the sides of the mouth and help secure food to be taken in by the &ldquo;fangs&rdquo;, which dispense the tohr-kreen's venom.</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Combat:</b> J'ez enjoy combat and war and are good military leaders. They prefer to use psionics against their opponents when possible, closing to melee when psionic attack is not an option. J'ez prefer manufactured weapons, especially the gythka, that can slash for 1-6 (1d6) points of damage against targets of man-size or smaller, or for 1-10 (1d10) points of damage against a larger target. Like thri-kreen, j'ez tohrkreen have a natural AC 5 because of their exoskeletons, and are immune to <i>hold person</i> and <i>charm person</i> spells. They learn other special abilities as they age.</p><p><i>Leap:</i> This ability allows j.ez to leap 20 feet straight up or 50 feet forward. They cannot leap backward.</p><p><i>Venom:</i> A bite delivers this venom. Anyone bitten must make a successful save vs. paralyzation or be paralyzed. Smaller than man-sized creatures are paralyzed for 2-10 (2d10) rounds, man-sized for 2-8 (2d8) rounds, large creatures for 1-8 (1d8) rounds, and huge and gargantuan creatures for 1 round.</p><p><i>Chatkcha:</i> J'ez can throw two chatkcha per round, as far as 270 feet. A chatkcha causes 3-8 (1d6+2) points of damage when it hits, and returns to the thrower when it misses.</p><p><i>Dodge missiles:</i> Mature j'ez can dodge missiles fired at them with a roll of 9 or better on 1d20; they cannot dodge magical effects, only physical missiles. Magical physical missiles (arrows, thrown axes) modify this roll by their magical bonus.</p><p><i>Psionics:</i> Many j'ez (50%) are psionicists. The rest have psionic wild talents (see The Complete psionics Handbook).</p><p><i>Magical and psionic items:</i> J'ez never use magical items, but all have at least one item with psionic powers.</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Habitat/Society:</b> J'ez usually live in rocky badlands and sandy wastes, terrain that exists throughout most of their nation in the North. J'ez are often psionicists and philosophers, but tend to be aggressive. Their philosophy requires them to remain combat capable. J'ez have mating habits and gestation periods similar to those of thri-kreen. J'ez can live to be 80 years old.</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Ecology:</b> Tohr-kreen are carnivores. They build towns and cities. They work with a similar species, the zik-chil, to produce zik-trin'ta scouts.</p><p>J'ez architecture and art are average, but their literature is superb. Treasure carried by a j'ez is often books and gems (substitute psionic items for any indicated magical items).</p><h2>J'hol Tohr-kreen</h2><p class=\"f\">The figures given are for mature adult j'hol.

A j'hol's abdomen is small compared to other kreens, and the j'hol is almost humanoid in appearance. A j'hol is better built for stony barrens and rocky badlands, terrain that exists throughout most of its nation.</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Combat:</b> J'hol enjoy combat. Many have warrior character classes and some are psionicists. J'hol prefer long-range combat with missiles and psionics, but also use then leaping ability to charge into combat (standard charging adjustments, -2 to initiative, +2 to attack rolls, and a +1 penalty to AC). J'hol usually enter melee using a gythka, but also fight with claws and bite if necessary. J'hol tohr-kreen have a natural AC 5 because of their exoskeletons and are immune to <i>hold person</i> and <i>charm person</i> spells. They also learn other special abilities as they grow older.</p><p><i>Leap:</i> This ability allows j.hol to leap 30 feet straight up or 60 feet forward. They can leap backward 10 feet.</p><p><i>Chatkcha:</i> J'hol can throw two chatkcha or kyorkcha per round, as far as 270 feet. A chatkcha causes 3-8 (1d6+2) points of damage, the kyorkcha, 3-10 (1d8+2) points of damage. Both weapons return to the thrower if they miss.</p><p><i>Dodge missiles:</i> Mature j'hol can dodge missiles fired at them on a roll of 8 or better on 1d20. They cannot dodge magical effects, only physical missiles. Magical physical missiles (arrows, thrown axes) modify this roll by their magical bonus.</p><p><i>Venom:</i> Though j'hol produce venom like other kreen, most use it to produce the crystal needed to make chatkcha and kyorkcha. Only 5% of j'hol actually have a venomous bite. Their venom paralyzes most creatures for 1-4 (1d4) rounds, huge and gargantuan creatures for only 1 round.</p><p><i>Psionics:</i> At least one j'hol (and as many as 25%) in a group is a psionicist. About 50% of the rest have psionic wild talents, described in <i>The Complete Psionics Handbook</i>.</p><p><i>Magical and psionic items:</i> J'hol rarely use magical items, but sometimes carry items with psionic powers.</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Habitat/Society:</b> J'hol are more inclined toward building and crafting the other tohr-kreen. Their cities are elaborately made, and usually quite large, with vast parks, ornate decorations, high walkways, and tall spires.</p><p>Popular professions among j'hol include the psionicist and all warrior professions. Gladiators are rare among j'hol, but j'hol enjoy combat and like watching gladiatorial contests; their arenas are some of the most popular in the North.</p><p>J.hol have mating habits and gestation periods similar to those of thri-kreen and can live to be 50 years old.</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Ecology:</b> J'hol are builders and make fine clothing and tools, and they are the only kreen who routinely work metal. J'hol make beautiful crystalline weapons. For individuals, a finely made crystalline weapon (a chatkcha or kyorkcha, or a gythka with crystalline heads) should be substituted for indicated art objects, while a psionic item should be used if a magical item is indicated.</p><p></p><br clear=\"all\" style=\"clear:both; height:0;\">\r\n","images":["<img src=\"grf/ds.gif\" width=\"150\" height=\"75\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Dark Sun\" title=\"Dark Sun\" align=\"right\">","<img src=\"img/tohrkre2.gif\" alt=\"Tohr-kreen II\" title=\"Tohr-kreen II\" border=\"0\" width=\"300\" height=\"360\" style=\"text-align:right;\" align=\"right\">","<img src=\"grf/add2_01.gif\" width=\"200\" height=\"56\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Advanced Dungeons & Dragons 2nd Edition\">"],"setting":"Dark Sun","statblock":{"J'ez":{"Activity Cycle":"Constant","Alignment":"Any lawful","Armor Class":"5","Climate/Terrain":"Any land","Damage/Attack":"1d3 (&times;4)/1d6+1 or 1d6+1 and by weapon","Diet":"Carnivore","Frequency":"Common in the North, very rare elsewhere","Hit Dice":"6+3","Intelligence":"Average to genius (8-18)","Magic Resistance":"Nil","Morale":"Champion (15-16)","Movement":"18","No. Appearing":"3d12","No. of Attacks":"5 or 2","Organization":"Clutch and state","Size":"L (9' long)","Special Attacks":"Paralyzation","Special Defenses":"Missile dodge","THAC0":"13","Treasure":"U (see below)","XP Value":"1,400"},"J'hol":{"Activity Cycle":"Constant","Alignment":"Any non-good","Armor Class":"5","Climate/Terrain":"Any land","Damage/Attack":"1d4 (&times;4)/1d4+1 or 1d4+1 and by weapon","Diet":"Carnivore","Frequency":"Common in the North, very rare elsewhere","Hit Dice":"6+3","Intelligence":"Average to excentional (8-16)","Magic Resistance":"Nil","Morale":"Fanatic (17-18)","Movement":"18","No. Appearing":"3d10","No. of Attacks":"5 or 2","Organization":"Clutch and state","Size":"M (6' tall)","Special Attacks":"Leap","Special Defenses":"Missile dodge","THAC0":"13","Treasure":"U (see below)","XP Value":"1,400"}},"title":"Tohr-kreen II"},"sources":["2433"],"statblock_names":[],"title":"Tohr-kreen II","prev_key":"tohrkre1","next_key":"tohrkre3","monster_path":"/appendix/tohrkre2"}},"staticQueryHashes":[],"slicesMap":{}}
