While the powers listed above are the most common, some aarakocra have different or additional powers.</p><p class=\"f\">A race of intelligent, birdlike creatures living in the deepest deserts of Athas, the rare Athasian <a href=\"/appendix/aarakocr\">aarakocra</a> spends its time soaring on thermals in search of food.</p><p>The aarakocra is 7 to 8 feet tall with a wingspan of 20 feet or more. Because of its large wingspan, an aarakocra can carry as much as 75% of its own body weight and still fly easily. An aarakocra can fly a short distance carrying a burden equaling 125% of its own body weight. The average body weight of a full grown male is 100 pounds and a female is 85 pounds.</p><p>Each wing has a &ldquo;hand&rdquo; at its midpoint, consisting of three fingers and an opposable thumb. The fourth finger forms the rigid leading edge of the wing. In flight the hands cannot be used, but on the ground the aarakocra can use its hands almost as a human would. The aarakocra's body is protected by a thin bony plate on the chest, much like a solid rib cage. Talons on its legs can be used as claws and can be retracted to reveal a second set of hands, also with three fingers and an opposable thumb. Except for the chest plate, the entire skeleton is hollow and extremely fragile.</p><p>From a distance, the Athasian aarakocra resembles a huge <a href=\"/appendix/bird\">vulture</a>. Its black eyes, set in the front of the head, provide excellent vision over a long range. The plumage is generally black with a white collar for adult males and black or brown with a smaller white collar for females. Adolescents are a mixture of brown and black. The beak is large and covers most of the head. Plumage begins at the crown of the head and is darker near the head, except for the collar. Athasian aarakocra speak their own language and the languages of vultures and other large birds. Some speak the common tongue (5% to 10% chance depending on how deep in the wastelands a tribe lives).</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Combat:</b> Aarakocra can fight in the air or on the ground. They prefer aerial combat since their bones are too fragile to withstand a solid blow from a human-sized opponent. In combat against creatures on the ground, they prefer to fly over their victim and drop weighted nets. Some aarakocra use darts to harass ground-based opponents.</p><p>If their opponents can fly, the aarakocra generally forgo the use of the net, although large groups sometimes use nets on flying creatures. Normally, aarakocra attack flying creatures with long spears, diving from above and allowing the momentum to carry the spear through the target. Such an attack doubles the damage if the aarakocra have been able to dive at least 50 feet. Only the very largest aarakocra can carry more than one of these spears, they can attack with both at once with no penalty, causing double damage on each strike. All diving attacks are made at +4 and should be treated as a charge attack. All other penalties and restrictions of charge attacks apply.</p><p>The effect of the aarakocra's nets depends on if the opponent is flying at the time it becomes entangled. Creatures on the ground that are hit by a net are entangled and unable to participate in any combat until they make a successful Strength check to get free of the net. Flying creatures hit by a net can no longer fly and immediately begin falling. If they cannot escape the net or use some magical means to arrest the fall, normal falling damage applies.</p><p>Unless victims are entangled in nets, aarakocra are cautious in ground combat. If the aarakocra outnumber their opponents they advance in a straight line and thrust with their spears. If outnumbered, or the opponents are particularly tough, the aarakocra withdraw. Victims entangled in nets are killed or incapacitated for use as food or ransom.</p><p>Athasian aarakocra are mindful of their physical limitations as well as their comparatively low psionic abilities. They do not normally initiate psionic combat. At the first sign of psionic powers from any of their victims, however, all aarakocra that have some ability will use whatever attack and defense modes they can in an attempt to destroy the threat. Large groups of is or more aarakocra may initiate psionic combat if their leaders feel they can win quickly and avoid physical combat.</p><p>In desperation, an aarakocra can attempt to bite an opponent in combat. Because of the unwieldiness of its beak, the aarakocra has a THAC0 of 18 if attacking with this appendage. Further, the birdman causes only 1d2 points of damage with the beak.</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Habitat/Society:</b> Athasian aarakocra live in tribes with 6-20 (2d8+4) members, depending on the prestige of the leader. The largest tribe ever recorded had 50 members. The tribal hunting territory depends on the size of the tribe, usually about 500 square miles for a tribe of 10 members. There are no rigid boundaries between tribes and border disputes are not uncommon.</p><p>Alignments of tribe members are similar to the alignment of the leader. A tribe that has a leader who is neutral good may have neutral good, chaotic good, lawful good, and true neutral members. A predominantly evil tribe does not recognize boundaries with other tribes and treats other tribes as inferior beings to be eliminated.</p><p>Athasian aarakocra aren't happy in enclosed spaces, but they they take refuge in a cave or building if necessary.</p><p>Nonevil tribes live in rocky aeries in the highest peaks they can find. Evil tribes are normally nomadic and use an aerie made by another tribe if they need to remain in an area for a long time, even if they have to evict the tribe that made the nest.</p><p>Aarakocra aren't friendly toward intruders in their territory, especially caravans. They try to extract a toll from the caravan for passage through the desert. Good-aligned tribes allow unhindered passage of caravans that pay a tribute. If someone refuses to pay the tribute, the aarakocra try to capture scouts or outriders from the party and hold them until an even larger tribute is paid. The payment may be either livestock or shiny objects. Aarakocra are smart enough not to be taken in by glass baubles instead of gems, although they cannot tell the difference between the more common gems and the rare ones.</p><p>Evil tribes ask for tribute and often attack a caravan whether it pays or not. Aarakocra always demand shiny objects such as stones. These tribes find humans and demihumans to be quite tasty and prefer them to other food.</p><p>Good-aligned tribes of aarakocra sometimes return a lost traveler to the edge of the desert after first removing any valuables the traveler may be carrying. On very rare occasions a tribe might return a lost group of travelers to the more frequently traveled parts of the desert, again after first taking any valuables as payment.</p><p>The oldest male is the leader of the tribal hunting party and has 4+4 Hit Dice. The oldest female is in charge of the tribal aerie and has 3+3 HD. In tribes that have more than 15 members, the next oldest aarakocra serves as shaman and has 3+3 HD; the shaman completes the triumvirate necessary for proper worship and the summoning of elementals. (Interestingly, no magic-using aarakocra has ever been recorded.) Tribes without a shaman cannot summon <a href=\"/appendix/element1\">air elementals</a>, which is an important part of aarakocra culture.</p><p>The shaman is the leader of the daily sun worship. Aarakocra worship the sun because it provides them with the thermals they need to soar in search of food. The shaman also leads the mystic rituals used to summon an air elemental. Summoning an air elemental is usually done only in preparation for the tribe's most sacred ceremony, the hunt. Small tribes must band together for this ceremony to allow the triumvirate to be formed.</p><p>The ceremony to summon an air elemental must be conducted at dawn and requires the oldest male and female to emit a highpitched keening whistle. The shaman conducts an intricate dance around them, simultaneously chanting an ancient summoning mantra.</p><p>The hunt is the final part of the initiation of adolescent aarakocra to adulthood and often takes the tribe far from their normal teritory. The target is always a <a href=\"/appendix/drakalsi\">silt drake</a>. The hunt is the only time the females leave the relative safety of the nest. Even an evil tribe will not interfere with a tribe on a hunt. An air elemental is often summoned to help find the drake, but never takes part in the actual combat. Although the adult members of the tribe take part in the initial phases of the combat, it is the initiates who deliver the final, killing blows to me drake. Scars from the hunt are considered a mark of pride among all aarakocra.</p><p>The females spend about eight months of the year incubating their eggs. Athasian aarakocra mate for life and a pair normally produces as many as 10 offspring. A female lays one egg a year. Constant incubation is not required because of the high daytime temperatures, so the females can maintain the nest and keep the tribe's treasure in order.</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Ecology:</b> Athasian aarakocra are high on the food chain and have no natural enemies other than <a href=\"/appendix/drakatha\">drakes</a>. Unless evil, aarakocra leave their own territory only to hunt the silt drake and return as soon as possible when the hunt is over. (Evil aarakocra attack others, as noted above.) Aarakocra eggs and hatchlings are sought after by wealthy land owners who wish to use the creatures as scouts and sentries. An egg can bring as much as 10 cp in Tyr's marketplace. Tribes that have had eggs or hatchlings stolen have long memories and sometimes take revenge against the thief at a later date. Captive aarakocra join any tribe they come in contact with.</p><p>Athasian aarakocra have a natural life span of 21-30 years.</p><p></p><br clear=\"all\" style=\"clear:both; height:0;\">\r\n","images":["<img src=\"grf/ds.gif\" width=\"150\" height=\"75\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Dark Sun\" title=\"Dark Sun\" align=\"right\">","<img src=\"img/aarakath.gif\" alt=\"Aarakocra (Athas)\" title=\"Aarakocra (Athas)\" border=\"0\" width=\"300\" height=\"360\" style=\"text-align:right;\" align=\"right\">","<img src=\"grf/add2_01.gif\" width=\"200\" height=\"56\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Advanced Dungeons & Dragons 2nd Edition\">"],"setting":"Dark Sun","statblock":{"Aarakocra (Athas)":{"Activity Cycle":"Day","Alignment":"Any","Armor Class":"7","Climate/Terrain":"Deep desert","Damage/Attack":"1d3/1d3 or by weapon","Diet":"Carnivore","Frequency":"Rare","Hit Dice":"2+2","Intelligence":"Average (8-10)","Magic Resistance":"Nil","Morale":"Steady (11)","Movement":"6, Fl 36 (C)","No. Appearing":"1d10","No. of Attacks":"2","Organization":"Tribal","Size":"M (20'+ wingspan)","Special Attacks":"Nil","Special Defenses":"Nil","THAC0":"17","Treasure":"Varies","XP Value":"65"}},"title":"Aarakocra (Athas)"},"sources":["2433"],"statblock_names":[],"title":"Aarakocra (Athas)","prev_key":"zygraat","next_key":"aarakocr","monster_path":"/appendix/aarakath"}}},"pageContext":{"monster_key":"batspore","monster_data":{"TSR":["2158"],"fullBody":"  <table cellspacing=\"0\" cellpadding=\"0\"><tr><th>Climate/Terrain:</th><td>Temperate hills and plains</td></tr><tr><th>Frequency:</th><td>Very rare</td></tr><tr><th>Organization:</th><td>Clutch</td></tr><tr><th>Activity Cycle:</th><td>Night</td></tr><tr><th>Diet:</th><td>Carnivore</td></tr><tr><th>Intelligence:</th><td>Average to Very (8-12)</td></tr><tr><th>Treasure:</th><td>Nil</td></tr><tr><th>Alignment:</th><td>Neutral</td></tr><tr><th>No. Appearing:</th><td>14</td></tr><tr><th>Armor Class:</th><td>8</td></tr><tr><th>Movement:</th><td>3, Fl 30 (B)</td></tr><tr><th>Hit Dice:</th><td>8</td></tr><tr><th>THAC0:</th><td>13</td></tr><tr><th>No. of Attacks:</th><td>3</td></tr><tr><th>Damage/Attack:</th><td>2d6 each</td></tr><tr><th>Special Attacks:</th><td>Surprise, poison eye-blast</td></tr><tr><th>Special Defenses:</th><td>Alertness, immune to heat and fire</td></tr><tr><th>Magic Resistance:</th><td>Nil</td></tr><tr><th>Size:</th><td>M (3' long, 8' wingspan)</td></tr><tr><th>Morale:</th><td>Elite (14)</td></tr><tr><th>XP Value:</th><td>7,000</td></tr></table><p class=\"f\">This fungoid predator, sometimes called a <i>flying eye</i>, is a deadly opponent when airborne, but is nearly helpless when on the ground. The creature is about 3 feet long, with a wingspan of more than double that. It has three powerful claws and a single, dark eye that emits poisonous blasts. Its flesh is a deep gray or flat black.</p><p>The thinking process of the sporebat is quite alien, nearly unfathomable to animal lifeforms. They possess no language that can be understood by humanoids, some sages believe their reactions in certain situations indicate an understanding of several human, demihuman, and humanoid languages. In addition, their hunting techniques indicate a cold intelligence.</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Combat:</b> The sporebat is extremely stealthy. It moves with complete silence, and its dark coloration allows it to blend into shadows, or to remain unnoticed against a night sky. The creature remains at the same temperature as its surroundings, so cannot be detected because of a temperature difference. In addition, the sporebat hides and lies in wait for victims, swooping quickly to attack when something comes into view. All this adds up to an impressive -6 to opponents' surprise rolls, as well as a -2 penalty to opponents' attack rolls in darkness. The sporebat is very alert itself and gains a +3 bonus to its surprise rolls.</p><p>Sporebats are fearless predators and might attack even a large and well-armed group. They often begin an attack using their devastating eye-blasts. A sporebat can project a poisonous ray from its eye, in a cone 50 yards long and 10 yards wide at the base. Any creature caught in this area takes 4d6 points of damage, though a successful saving throw vs. breath weapon reduces damage by half. The eye-blast must then recharge, a process that requires 1 round per 1d6 of damage; thus, if the sporebat recharges for 2 rounds, it can unleash a blast that causes 2d6 damage (a saving throw for half damage still applies). The sporebat usually waits until fully recharged before using the eye-blast again, unless severely injured. A <i>slow poison</i> spell doubles the amount of time needed for the creature to recharge its eye-blast; a <i>neutralize poison</i> (which requires the caster to touch the sporebat) destroys any stored potential for an eye-blast, but the creature begins recharging immediately thereafter.</p><p>While the sporebat waits for its eye-blast to recharge, it launches a series of swooping attacks, returning every other round from a different direction to claw at its opponents. When more than one sporebat is present, they take turns attacking, so that at least one sporebat attacks every round. Each of the sporebat's three vicious claw inflicts 2d6 damage on a successful strike.</p><p>The sporebat is immune to heat and fire-based attacks, as well as to the sporebat eye-blast.</p><p>After the sporebat has slain all opponents in view, it settles over its kills and uses its claws to slice them into very small pieces, then eats the juicy remains with its toothy mouth. During breeding season (in the late fall), a sporebat might instead plant spores in one of its kills.</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Habitat/Society:</b> Found in places that allow them space to fly, sporebats usually travel and hunt in <q>clutches</q>, groups born from spores planted in the same carrion. They have no society that can be understood by humans. All attempts at using psionic methods or <i>ESP</i> spells to communicate with them yield only a series of strange and disturbing images, none comprehensible. Still, the creatures do seem to communicate with one another, perhaps telepathically, perhaps through the use of spores, perhaps by some other unknown method.</p><p>Sporebats seem to place great value on the companions in their clutch, often seeming to become enraged when a spore-mate is slain.</p><p>Sporebat reproduction requires that two sporebats release spores over the same recently-killed animal flesh at the same time. Several of the spores unite in the dead flesh, and 1d6 young sporebats grow within a day. A young sporebat is about a foot long, with a 3-foot wingspan; its attacks cause only half damage. A sporebat grows to adulthood in six months and can live for more than a century.</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Ecology:</b> Sporebats are dangerous predators that feed on all types of animals, including both herbivores and other predators. Camivores find the taste of sporebat flesh revolting, though some herbivores feed happily on dead sporebats. The flesh of a sporebat is considered a delicacy by some human and humanoid cultures.</p><p></p><br clear=\"all\" style=\"clear:both; height:0;\">\r\n","images":["<img src=\"grf/xx.gif\" width=\"150\" height=\"75\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Advanced Dungeons & Dragons 2nd Edition\" title=\"Advanced Dungeons & Dragons 2nd Edition\" align=\"right\">","<img src=\"img/batspore.gif\" alt=\"Bat, Sporebat\" title=\"Bat, Sporebat\" border=\"0\" width=\"300\" height=\"360\" style=\"text-align:right;\" align=\"right\">","<img src=\"grf/tsr_sm.png\" width=\"56\" height=\"59\" border=\"0\" alt=\"TSR\">"],"setting":"Advanced Dungeons & Dragons 2nd Edition","statblock":{"Bat, Sporebat":{"Activity Cycle":"Night","Alignment":"Neutral","Armor Class":"8","Climate/Terrain":"Temperate hills and plains","Damage/Attack":"2d6 each","Diet":"Carnivore","Frequency":"Very rare","Hit Dice":"8","Intelligence":"Average to Very (8-12)","Magic Resistance":"Nil","Morale":"Elite (14)","Movement":"3, Fl 30 (B)","No. Appearing":"14","No. of Attacks":"3","Organization":"Clutch","Size":"M (3' long, 8' wingspan)","Special Attacks":"Surprise, poison eye-blast","Special Defenses":"Alertness, immune to heat and fire","THAC0":"13","Treasure":"Nil","XP Value":"7,000"}},"title":"Bat, Sporebat"},"sources":["2158"],"statblock_names":[],"title":"Bat, Sporebat","prev_key":"batrv","next_key":"bear","monster_path":"/appendix/batspore"}},"staticQueryHashes":[],"slicesMap":{}}
