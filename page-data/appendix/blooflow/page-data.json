As the plant feeds, the petals become slowly pink, eventually flushing to a deep, rich red. After four turns, digestion is completed and the plant is ready to feed again. The wild bloodflower grows in clumps of 2-5 bushlike plants.</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Combat:</b> The flower exudes a fastacting narcotic perfume that is effective within a 5' radius. Victims must save vs. poison or fall asleep immediately. If the victim falls within 2' of the plant, the plant stretches out and attaches a set of 6&rdquo;-long spiny underleaves to the victim's body. These leaves then drain blood from the victim, doing damage each round equivalent to the plant's hit points. If the victim is not removed from the vicinity of the bloodflower, he remains unconscious and the plant continues to feed until the victim dies. If removed from the area of the plant's perfume, the victim regains consciousness after one turn. Healing may occur in any normal fashion.</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Habitat/Society:</b> Because the plant blooms both day and night, the domestic species is sometimes used as a passive defense and may be found scattered about in flower gardens or in huge beds surrounding important buildings or cities. Individual potted flowers are kept in treasure rooms as traps for the unwary.</p><br clear=\"all\" style=\"clear:both; height:0;\">\r\n","images":["<img src=\"grf/dr.gif\" width=\"150\" height=\"75\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Dragon Magazine\" title=\"Dragon Magazine\" align=\"right\">","<img src=\"grf/add2_01.gif\" width=\"200\" height=\"56\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Advanced Dungeons & Dragons 2nd Edition\">"],"setting":"Dragon Magazine","statblock":{"Bloodflower":{"Activity Cycle":"Any","Alignment":"Neutral","Armor Class":"10","Climate/Terrain":"Temperate and subtropical marshes and jungles","Damage/Attack":"See below","Diet":"Carnivore","Frequency":"Rare","Hit Dice":"1 hp per bloom","Intelligence":"Non- (0)","Magic Resistance":"Nil","Morale":"Average (9)","Movement":"0","No. Appearing":"See below","No. of Attacks":"1","Organization":"Solitary","Size":"S (1'-tall bush)","Special Attacks":"Narcotic perfume, blood drain","Special Defenses":"Nil","THAC0":"20","Treasure":"Incidental (10% chance each of J,K,M; 5% chance each of Q and one small magical item)","XP Value":"65"}},"title":"Bloodflower"},"sources":["Dragon#167"],"statblock_names":[],"title":"Bloodflower","prev_key":"bloodsac","next_key":"bloogras"}},"staticQueryHashes":[],"slicesMap":{}}
