While the powers listed above are the most common, some aarakocra have different or additional powers.</p><p class=\"f\">A race of intelligent, birdlike creatures living in the deepest deserts of Athas, the rare Athasian <a href=\"/appendix/aarakocr\">aarakocra</a> spends its time soaring on thermals in search of food.</p><p>The aarakocra is 7 to 8 feet tall with a wingspan of 20 feet or more. Because of its large wingspan, an aarakocra can carry as much as 75% of its own body weight and still fly easily. An aarakocra can fly a short distance carrying a burden equaling 125% of its own body weight. The average body weight of a full grown male is 100 pounds and a female is 85 pounds.</p><p>Each wing has a &ldquo;hand&rdquo; at its midpoint, consisting of three fingers and an opposable thumb. The fourth finger forms the rigid leading edge of the wing. In flight the hands cannot be used, but on the ground the aarakocra can use its hands almost as a human would. The aarakocra's body is protected by a thin bony plate on the chest, much like a solid rib cage. Talons on its legs can be used as claws and can be retracted to reveal a second set of hands, also with three fingers and an opposable thumb. Except for the chest plate, the entire skeleton is hollow and extremely fragile.</p><p>From a distance, the Athasian aarakocra resembles a huge <a href=\"/appendix/bird\">vulture</a>. Its black eyes, set in the front of the head, provide excellent vision over a long range. The plumage is generally black with a white collar for adult males and black or brown with a smaller white collar for females. Adolescents are a mixture of brown and black. The beak is large and covers most of the head. Plumage begins at the crown of the head and is darker near the head, except for the collar. Athasian aarakocra speak their own language and the languages of vultures and other large birds. Some speak the common tongue (5% to 10% chance depending on how deep in the wastelands a tribe lives).</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Combat:</b> Aarakocra can fight in the air or on the ground. They prefer aerial combat since their bones are too fragile to withstand a solid blow from a human-sized opponent. In combat against creatures on the ground, they prefer to fly over their victim and drop weighted nets. Some aarakocra use darts to harass ground-based opponents.</p><p>If their opponents can fly, the aarakocra generally forgo the use of the net, although large groups sometimes use nets on flying creatures. Normally, aarakocra attack flying creatures with long spears, diving from above and allowing the momentum to carry the spear through the target. Such an attack doubles the damage if the aarakocra have been able to dive at least 50 feet. Only the very largest aarakocra can carry more than one of these spears, they can attack with both at once with no penalty, causing double damage on each strike. All diving attacks are made at +4 and should be treated as a charge attack. All other penalties and restrictions of charge attacks apply.</p><p>The effect of the aarakocra's nets depends on if the opponent is flying at the time it becomes entangled. Creatures on the ground that are hit by a net are entangled and unable to participate in any combat until they make a successful Strength check to get free of the net. Flying creatures hit by a net can no longer fly and immediately begin falling. If they cannot escape the net or use some magical means to arrest the fall, normal falling damage applies.</p><p>Unless victims are entangled in nets, aarakocra are cautious in ground combat. If the aarakocra outnumber their opponents they advance in a straight line and thrust with their spears. If outnumbered, or the opponents are particularly tough, the aarakocra withdraw. Victims entangled in nets are killed or incapacitated for use as food or ransom.</p><p>Athasian aarakocra are mindful of their physical limitations as well as their comparatively low psionic abilities. They do not normally initiate psionic combat. At the first sign of psionic powers from any of their victims, however, all aarakocra that have some ability will use whatever attack and defense modes they can in an attempt to destroy the threat. Large groups of is or more aarakocra may initiate psionic combat if their leaders feel they can win quickly and avoid physical combat.</p><p>In desperation, an aarakocra can attempt to bite an opponent in combat. Because of the unwieldiness of its beak, the aarakocra has a THAC0 of 18 if attacking with this appendage. Further, the birdman causes only 1d2 points of damage with the beak.</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Habitat/Society:</b> Athasian aarakocra live in tribes with 6-20 (2d8+4) members, depending on the prestige of the leader. The largest tribe ever recorded had 50 members. The tribal hunting territory depends on the size of the tribe, usually about 500 square miles for a tribe of 10 members. There are no rigid boundaries between tribes and border disputes are not uncommon.</p><p>Alignments of tribe members are similar to the alignment of the leader. A tribe that has a leader who is neutral good may have neutral good, chaotic good, lawful good, and true neutral members. A predominantly evil tribe does not recognize boundaries with other tribes and treats other tribes as inferior beings to be eliminated.</p><p>Athasian aarakocra aren't happy in enclosed spaces, but they they take refuge in a cave or building if necessary.</p><p>Nonevil tribes live in rocky aeries in the highest peaks they can find. Evil tribes are normally nomadic and use an aerie made by another tribe if they need to remain in an area for a long time, even if they have to evict the tribe that made the nest.</p><p>Aarakocra aren't friendly toward intruders in their territory, especially caravans. They try to extract a toll from the caravan for passage through the desert. Good-aligned tribes allow unhindered passage of caravans that pay a tribute. If someone refuses to pay the tribute, the aarakocra try to capture scouts or outriders from the party and hold them until an even larger tribute is paid. The payment may be either livestock or shiny objects. Aarakocra are smart enough not to be taken in by glass baubles instead of gems, although they cannot tell the difference between the more common gems and the rare ones.</p><p>Evil tribes ask for tribute and often attack a caravan whether it pays or not. Aarakocra always demand shiny objects such as stones. These tribes find humans and demihumans to be quite tasty and prefer them to other food.</p><p>Good-aligned tribes of aarakocra sometimes return a lost traveler to the edge of the desert after first removing any valuables the traveler may be carrying. On very rare occasions a tribe might return a lost group of travelers to the more frequently traveled parts of the desert, again after first taking any valuables as payment.</p><p>The oldest male is the leader of the tribal hunting party and has 4+4 Hit Dice. The oldest female is in charge of the tribal aerie and has 3+3 HD. In tribes that have more than 15 members, the next oldest aarakocra serves as shaman and has 3+3 HD; the shaman completes the triumvirate necessary for proper worship and the summoning of elementals. (Interestingly, no magic-using aarakocra has ever been recorded.) Tribes without a shaman cannot summon <a href=\"/appendix/element1\">air elementals</a>, which is an important part of aarakocra culture.</p><p>The shaman is the leader of the daily sun worship. Aarakocra worship the sun because it provides them with the thermals they need to soar in search of food. The shaman also leads the mystic rituals used to summon an air elemental. Summoning an air elemental is usually done only in preparation for the tribe's most sacred ceremony, the hunt. Small tribes must band together for this ceremony to allow the triumvirate to be formed.</p><p>The ceremony to summon an air elemental must be conducted at dawn and requires the oldest male and female to emit a highpitched keening whistle. The shaman conducts an intricate dance around them, simultaneously chanting an ancient summoning mantra.</p><p>The hunt is the final part of the initiation of adolescent aarakocra to adulthood and often takes the tribe far from their normal teritory. The target is always a <a href=\"/appendix/drakalsi\">silt drake</a>. The hunt is the only time the females leave the relative safety of the nest. Even an evil tribe will not interfere with a tribe on a hunt. An air elemental is often summoned to help find the drake, but never takes part in the actual combat. Although the adult members of the tribe take part in the initial phases of the combat, it is the initiates who deliver the final, killing blows to me drake. Scars from the hunt are considered a mark of pride among all aarakocra.</p><p>The females spend about eight months of the year incubating their eggs. Athasian aarakocra mate for life and a pair normally produces as many as 10 offspring. A female lays one egg a year. Constant incubation is not required because of the high daytime temperatures, so the females can maintain the nest and keep the tribe's treasure in order.</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Ecology:</b> Athasian aarakocra are high on the food chain and have no natural enemies other than <a href=\"/appendix/drakatha\">drakes</a>. Unless evil, aarakocra leave their own territory only to hunt the silt drake and return as soon as possible when the hunt is over. (Evil aarakocra attack others, as noted above.) Aarakocra eggs and hatchlings are sought after by wealthy land owners who wish to use the creatures as scouts and sentries. An egg can bring as much as 10 cp in Tyr's marketplace. Tribes that have had eggs or hatchlings stolen have long memories and sometimes take revenge against the thief at a later date. Captive aarakocra join any tribe they come in contact with.</p><p>Athasian aarakocra have a natural life span of 21-30 years.</p><p></p><br clear=\"all\" style=\"clear:both; height:0;\">\r\n","images":["<img src=\"grf/ds.gif\" width=\"150\" height=\"75\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Dark Sun\" title=\"Dark Sun\" align=\"right\">","<img src=\"img/aarakath.gif\" alt=\"Aarakocra (Athas)\" title=\"Aarakocra (Athas)\" border=\"0\" width=\"300\" height=\"360\" style=\"text-align:right;\" align=\"right\">","<img src=\"grf/add2_01.gif\" width=\"200\" height=\"56\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Advanced Dungeons & Dragons 2nd Edition\">"],"setting":"Dark Sun","statblock":{"Aarakocra (Athas)":{"Activity Cycle":"Day","Alignment":"Any","Armor Class":"7","Climate/Terrain":"Deep desert","Damage/Attack":"1d3/1d3 or by weapon","Diet":"Carnivore","Frequency":"Rare","Hit Dice":"2+2","Intelligence":"Average (8-10)","Magic Resistance":"Nil","Morale":"Steady (11)","Movement":"6, Fl 36 (C)","No. Appearing":"1d10","No. of Attacks":"2","Organization":"Tribal","Size":"M (20'+ wingspan)","Special Attacks":"Nil","Special Defenses":"Nil","THAC0":"17","Treasure":"Varies","XP Value":"65"}},"title":"Aarakocra (Athas)"},"sources":["2433"],"statblock_names":[],"title":"Aarakocra (Athas)","prev_key":"zygraat","next_key":"aarakocr","monster_path":"/appendix/aarakath"}}},"pageContext":{"monster_key":"pleianim","monster_data":{"TSR":["2158"],"fullBody":"  <table cellspacing=\"0\" cellpadding=\"0\"><tr class=\"bk\"><th> </th><th class=\"cn\">Axebeak</th><th class=\"cn\">Balucitherium</th><th class=\"cn\">Irish Deer</th><th class=\"cn\">Megatherium</th><th class=\"cn\">Phororhacos</th><th class=\"cn\">Wooly Rhinoceros</th><th class=\"cn\">Titanothere</th></tr><tr><th>Climate/Terrain:</th><td>Plains</td><td>Plains</td><td>Forest</td><td>Forest</td><td>Plains</td><td>Plains</td><td>Plains</td></tr><tr><th>Frequency:</th><td>Uncommon</td><td>Rare</td><td>Rare</td><td>Uncommon</td><td>Uncommon</td><td>Common</td><td>Uncommon</td></tr><tr><th>Organization:</th><td>Flock</td><td>Solitary</td><td>Herd</td><td>Solitary</td><td>Flock</td><td>Herd</td><td>Herd</td></tr><tr><th>Activity Cycle:</th><td>Carnivore</td><td>Day</td><td>Day</td><td>Any</td><td>Day</td><td>Day</td><td>Day</td></tr><tr><th>Diet:</th><td>Day</td><td>Herbivore</td><td>Herbivore</td><td>Herbivore</td><td>Carnivore</td><td>Herbivore</td><td>Herbivore</td></tr><tr><th>Intelligence:</th><td>Animal (1)</td><td>Semi- (2-4)</td><td>Animal (1)</td><td>Animal (1)</td><td>Animal (1)</td><td>Animal (1)</td><td>Animal (1)</td></tr><tr><th>Treasure:</th><td>Nil</td><td>Nil</td><td>Nil</td><td>Nil</td><td>Nil</td><td>Nil</td><td>Nil</td></tr><tr><th>Alignment:</th><td>Neutral</td><td>Neutral</td><td>Neutral</td><td>Neutral</td><td>Neutral</td><td>Neutral</td><td>Neutral</td></tr><tr><th>No. Appearing:</th><td>1-6</td><td>1-3</td><td>1-8</td><td>1-6</td><td>2-12</td><td>1-4</td><td>1-12</td></tr><tr><th>Armor Class:</th><td>6</td><td>5</td><td>7</td><td>6</td><td>6</td><td>5</td><td>6</td></tr><tr><th>Movement:</th><td>18</td><td>12</td><td>18</td><td>6</td><td>15 (+1 jump)</td><td>12</td><td>12</td></tr><tr><th>Hit Dice:</th><td>3</td><td>14</td><td>4</td><td>10</td><td>7+7</td><td>10</td><td>12</td></tr><tr><th>THAC0:</th><td>17</td><td>7</td><td>17</td><td>11</td><td>13</td><td>11</td><td>9</td></tr><tr><th>No. of Attacks:</th><td>3</td><td>2</td><td>1 (2)</td><td>2</td><td>3</td><td>1</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><th>Damage/Attack:</th><td>1d3/1d3/2d4</td><td>5d4/5d4</td><td>2d6 (2d6)</td><td>2d6/2d6</td><td>1d4/1d4/2d6</td><td>2d6</td><td>2d8</td></tr><tr><th>Special Attacks:</th><td>Nil</td><td>Nil</td><td>Nil</td><td>Nil</td><td>Jump</td><td>Charge</td><td>Trample</td></tr><tr><th>Special Defenses:</th><td>Nil</td><td>Nil</td><td>Nil</td><td>Nil</td><td>Nil</td><td>Nil</td><td>Nil</td></tr><tr><th>Magic Resistance:</th><td>Nil</td><td>Nil</td><td>Nil</td><td>Nil</td><td>Nil</td><td>Nil</td><td>Nil</td></tr><tr><th>Size:</th><td>L (7' tall)</td><td>H (25')</td><td>L (7')</td><td>H (20')</td><td>L (10')</td><td>L (15')</td><td>H (16')</td></tr><tr><th>Morale:</th><td>Unsteady (5-7)</td><td>Average (8-10)</td><td>Average (8-10)</td><td>Average (8-10)</td><td>Average (8-10)</td><td>Average (8-10)</td><td>Average (8-10)</td></tr><tr><th>XP Value:</th><td>65</td><td>8,000</td><td>120</td><td>1,400</td><td>650</td><td>1,400</td><td>2,000</td></tr></table><p class=\"f\"><b><img src=\"/img/spc/axebeak.gif\" width=\"200\" height=\"240\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Axebeak\" title=\"Axebeak\" style=\"float:right;\">Axebeak</b></p>  <p class=\"ni\">Axebeaks are flightless, carnivorous <a href=\"/appendix/bird\">birds</a> that stand four feet tall at the shoulder. Axebeak markings resemble those of an <a href=\"/appendix/birdtori\">ostrich</a>. The immense head and long neck are covered in short white feathers. The body is covered in dense black feathers with a white underbelly and tail. The legs are covered in yellow scales.</p><p>The axebeak has a loud, honking voice that can be heard for a half mile. During mating time, the males make a thrumming sound like a bass violin. In combat, the bird hisses when not biting.</p><p>They are fast runners and aggressive hunters that pursue prey until fed or killed. They attack by kicking (1d3 points of damage per claw) and biting (2d4 points).</p><p>Axebeaks make crude nests of stones atop rocky outcroppings. During warm weather, there is a 25% chance that eggs or chicks are nearby. The chicks are 10%-80% grown with a proportionate number of Hit Dice. Immature axebeaks do not initiate combat, although they can defend themselves by biting for 1d4 points of damage.</p><p>Axebeak eggs and hatchlings are worth 50 to 80 gp. They can be raised as guards, hunters, and mounts. The long plume feathers of the wings and tail are worth 2 gp each.</p><p></p><p class=\"f\"><b><img src=\"/img/spc/balucith.gif\" width=\"200\" height=\"240\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Balucitherium\" title=\"Balucitherium\" style=\"float:left;\">Balucitherium</b></p>  <p class=\"ni\">The balucitherium is a prehistoric, hornless ancestor of the <a href=\"/appendix/mammher2\">rhinoceros</a>. It is a herbivore with a thick, grey-brown hide. The adult stands 15 to 18 feet at the shoulder and may measure up to 28 feet from nose to rump. The four-foot-long head swings on a thick, six-foot-long neck. The adult may weight up to 15 tons. It has poor eyesight but keen senses of hearing and smell.</p><p>The animal is very defensive. It tends to attack any animal it detects nearby. The beast attacks by trampling a foe with its front feet. Either hoof does 5d4 points of crushing damage.</p><p>Balucitheria are normally solitary creatures. If two are encountered, they are a mated pair. A third balucitherium is their calf. Roll a percentile die and multiply the result by 14 HD and 15 feet to determine the calf�s hit points and size.</p><p>If magically controlled or raised from a calf, a balucitherium can be trained to serve as a beast of burden. Its immense size and strength enable the beast to carry up to 8,000 pounds.</p><p>The hide is well-suited for making leather armor. An adult hide can be worth 50 to 100 gp.</p><p></p><p class=\"f\"><b><img src=\"/img/spc/irisdeer.gif\" width=\"200\" height=\"240\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Irish Deer\" title=\"Irish Deer\" style=\"float:right;\">Irish Deer</b></p>  <p class=\"ni\">This moose-sized creature dwells in temperate climes. Its antlers spread to a width of 10 feet, and it can actually gore two opponents within this span if they are directly before the creature. Irish deer are not generally aggressive, but are very dangerous during rutting season.</p><p></p><p class=\"f\"><b><img src=\"/img/spc/megather.gif\" width=\"200\" height=\"240\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Megatherium\" title=\"Megatherium\" style=\"float:left;\">Megatherium</b></p>  <p class=\"ni\">The megatherium is a giant, ground-dwelling sloth about the size of a grizzly bear. An adult may stand 20 feet tall and weigh 6,000 pounds. It is covered in long, russet hair. The beast is slow moving but more powerful than most animals that might otherwise prey on it. Because of its slow nature, the megatherium always strikes last in the round.</p><p>Despite its awesome appearance, the megatherium is primarily a peaceful herbivore grazing the wooded plains.</p><p>Each forepaw has three foot-long claws. These are primarily used to tear apart trees and shrubs for food, but they can also be used as weapons. The megatherium rears on its hind legs, then attacks with swipes that cause 2d6 points of damage from each paw.</p><p>The female megatherium gives birth to 1 or 2 cubs every other year. Cubs grow to maturity in four years and are found in 33% of all encounters.</p><p></p><p class=\"f\"><b><img src=\"/img/spc/phororha.gif\" width=\"200\" height=\"240\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Phororhacos\" title=\"Phororhacos\" style=\"float:right;\">Phororhacos</b></p>  <p class=\"ni\">The phororhacos is a nonflying bird with a huge head and powerful beak. It stands ten feet tall (six feet at the shoulder). It is covered with dark gray and brown feathers. An adult male will have a red crest and a tuft of brilliant orange feathers on the back of its head. The legs are light gray with black claws.</p><p>The phororhacos has a deep, braying voice. The bird will emit a fierce battle cry when fighting or challenging another male over territory.</p><p>Phororhacos gather in hunting and breeding packs. There is a 10% chance for either eggs or chicks in an encounter. The chicks have 10-80% of full growth with a proportionate numbr of Hit Dice. Chicks do not attack an active foe, but they do tear into a helpless vicitm in imitation of the adults.</p><p>It is a fearless killer and attacks even if it is outnumbered. It initiates an attack by jumping on its victim. When it is jumping to attack, its claws inflict double damage (2d4/2d4). Each round thereafter, the phororhacos kicks and claws for 1d4 points of damage per blow. It also snaps with its beak for 2d6 points of damage. If the phororacos successfully bites a target smaller than man-sized, it picks up the victim and shakes it around before throwing it back to the ground (1d6 points of falling damage. Such victims are unable to take any action the following round.</p><p>Phororhacos eggs and hatchlings are worth 70 to 100 gp. They can be raised as guards, hunters, and mounts.</p><p></p><p class=\"f\"><b><img src=\"/img/spc/woolrhin.gif\" width=\"200\" height=\"240\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Wooly Rhinoceros\" title=\"Wooly Rhinoceros\" style=\"float:left;\">Wooly Rhinoceros</b></p>  <p class=\"ni\">The wooly rhinoceros is similar to the modern rhino except that it is covered by a shaggy, russet coat and roams cold, temperate, and subarctic regions. It is an aggressive, belligerent herbivore that is very defensive about its territory.</p><p>The wooly rhino has poor eyesight but keen senses of hearing and smell, When one detects an intruder, the wooly rhino charges. The horn inflicts 2d6 points of damage, double if it strikes while charging. Man-sized or smaller targets are also tossed 10 to 20 feet by the force of the blow. The wooly rhino can trample man-sized or smaller victims, each foreleg causing 2d4 points of damage.</p><p>A wooly rhino will charge wagons or other vehicles, thinking them animals. Such charges deliver a crushing blow to the vehicle. An enraged wooly rhino can smash a wagon apart with little effort.</p><p>If two or three wooly rhinos are encountered, one is female. If four are encountered, the last one is a calf (30% to 60% of adult size). Adults gain +1 bonuses to their attack rolls if the calf is threatened. Wooly rhinos rarely abandon a captured or injured mate or offspring.</p><p>An adult hide is worth 20 to 30 gp; the thick skin is well suited for making armor. The horn is worth 10 to 20 gp to alchemists who use it in counterfeit healing potions.</p><p></p><p class=\"f\"><b><img src=\"/img/spc/titanoth.gif\" width=\"200\" height=\"240\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Titanothere\" title=\"Titanothere\" style=\"float:right;\">Titanothere</b></p>  <p class=\"ni\">The titanothere, also known as the <i>brontotherium</i>, is a rhino-like animal. The adult measure eight feet at the shoulder and 16 from nose to rump and weighs up to 8,000 pounds.</p><p>It is a huge and fearless herbivore armed with a yoke-shaped horn on its nose. The horn can be used to ram an opponent for 2d8 points of damage. Opponents of man-sized or smaller are also tossed up to 20 feet int the air by the force of the blow, It can trample man-sized or smaller victims with its forelegs, inflicting 2d4 points of damage with each foot.</p><p>If any creature threatens the herd, the bulls charge. If the charge strikes home, horn and trample damage is doubled.</p><p>If more than six titanotheres are encountered, there are 1d4 calves. The calves are 10 to 80% grown. They do not attack.
