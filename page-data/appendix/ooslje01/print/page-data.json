While the powers listed above are the most common, some aarakocra have different or additional powers.</p><p class=\"f\">A race of intelligent, birdlike creatures living in the deepest deserts of Athas, the rare Athasian <a href=\"/appendix/aarakocr\">aarakocra</a> spends its time soaring on thermals in search of food.</p><p>The aarakocra is 7 to 8 feet tall with a wingspan of 20 feet or more. Because of its large wingspan, an aarakocra can carry as much as 75% of its own body weight and still fly easily. An aarakocra can fly a short distance carrying a burden equaling 125% of its own body weight. The average body weight of a full grown male is 100 pounds and a female is 85 pounds.</p><p>Each wing has a &ldquo;hand&rdquo; at its midpoint, consisting of three fingers and an opposable thumb. The fourth finger forms the rigid leading edge of the wing. In flight the hands cannot be used, but on the ground the aarakocra can use its hands almost as a human would. The aarakocra's body is protected by a thin bony plate on the chest, much like a solid rib cage. Talons on its legs can be used as claws and can be retracted to reveal a second set of hands, also with three fingers and an opposable thumb. Except for the chest plate, the entire skeleton is hollow and extremely fragile.</p><p>From a distance, the Athasian aarakocra resembles a huge <a href=\"/appendix/bird\">vulture</a>. Its black eyes, set in the front of the head, provide excellent vision over a long range. The plumage is generally black with a white collar for adult males and black or brown with a smaller white collar for females. Adolescents are a mixture of brown and black. The beak is large and covers most of the head. Plumage begins at the crown of the head and is darker near the head, except for the collar. Athasian aarakocra speak their own language and the languages of vultures and other large birds. Some speak the common tongue (5% to 10% chance depending on how deep in the wastelands a tribe lives).</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Combat:</b> Aarakocra can fight in the air or on the ground. They prefer aerial combat since their bones are too fragile to withstand a solid blow from a human-sized opponent. In combat against creatures on the ground, they prefer to fly over their victim and drop weighted nets. Some aarakocra use darts to harass ground-based opponents.</p><p>If their opponents can fly, the aarakocra generally forgo the use of the net, although large groups sometimes use nets on flying creatures. Normally, aarakocra attack flying creatures with long spears, diving from above and allowing the momentum to carry the spear through the target. Such an attack doubles the damage if the aarakocra have been able to dive at least 50 feet. Only the very largest aarakocra can carry more than one of these spears, they can attack with both at once with no penalty, causing double damage on each strike. All diving attacks are made at +4 and should be treated as a charge attack. All other penalties and restrictions of charge attacks apply.</p><p>The effect of the aarakocra's nets depends on if the opponent is flying at the time it becomes entangled. Creatures on the ground that are hit by a net are entangled and unable to participate in any combat until they make a successful Strength check to get free of the net. Flying creatures hit by a net can no longer fly and immediately begin falling. If they cannot escape the net or use some magical means to arrest the fall, normal falling damage applies.</p><p>Unless victims are entangled in nets, aarakocra are cautious in ground combat. If the aarakocra outnumber their opponents they advance in a straight line and thrust with their spears. If outnumbered, or the opponents are particularly tough, the aarakocra withdraw. Victims entangled in nets are killed or incapacitated for use as food or ransom.</p><p>Athasian aarakocra are mindful of their physical limitations as well as their comparatively low psionic abilities. They do not normally initiate psionic combat. At the first sign of psionic powers from any of their victims, however, all aarakocra that have some ability will use whatever attack and defense modes they can in an attempt to destroy the threat. Large groups of is or more aarakocra may initiate psionic combat if their leaders feel they can win quickly and avoid physical combat.</p><p>In desperation, an aarakocra can attempt to bite an opponent in combat. Because of the unwieldiness of its beak, the aarakocra has a THAC0 of 18 if attacking with this appendage. Further, the birdman causes only 1d2 points of damage with the beak.</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Habitat/Society:</b> Athasian aarakocra live in tribes with 6-20 (2d8+4) members, depending on the prestige of the leader. The largest tribe ever recorded had 50 members. The tribal hunting territory depends on the size of the tribe, usually about 500 square miles for a tribe of 10 members. There are no rigid boundaries between tribes and border disputes are not uncommon.</p><p>Alignments of tribe members are similar to the alignment of the leader. A tribe that has a leader who is neutral good may have neutral good, chaotic good, lawful good, and true neutral members. A predominantly evil tribe does not recognize boundaries with other tribes and treats other tribes as inferior beings to be eliminated.</p><p>Athasian aarakocra aren't happy in enclosed spaces, but they they take refuge in a cave or building if necessary.</p><p>Nonevil tribes live in rocky aeries in the highest peaks they can find. Evil tribes are normally nomadic and use an aerie made by another tribe if they need to remain in an area for a long time, even if they have to evict the tribe that made the nest.</p><p>Aarakocra aren't friendly toward intruders in their territory, especially caravans. They try to extract a toll from the caravan for passage through the desert. Good-aligned tribes allow unhindered passage of caravans that pay a tribute. If someone refuses to pay the tribute, the aarakocra try to capture scouts or outriders from the party and hold them until an even larger tribute is paid. The payment may be either livestock or shiny objects. Aarakocra are smart enough not to be taken in by glass baubles instead of gems, although they cannot tell the difference between the more common gems and the rare ones.</p><p>Evil tribes ask for tribute and often attack a caravan whether it pays or not. Aarakocra always demand shiny objects such as stones. These tribes find humans and demihumans to be quite tasty and prefer them to other food.</p><p>Good-aligned tribes of aarakocra sometimes return a lost traveler to the edge of the desert after first removing any valuables the traveler may be carrying. On very rare occasions a tribe might return a lost group of travelers to the more frequently traveled parts of the desert, again after first taking any valuables as payment.</p><p>The oldest male is the leader of the tribal hunting party and has 4+4 Hit Dice. The oldest female is in charge of the tribal aerie and has 3+3 HD. In tribes that have more than 15 members, the next oldest aarakocra serves as shaman and has 3+3 HD; the shaman completes the triumvirate necessary for proper worship and the summoning of elementals. (Interestingly, no magic-using aarakocra has ever been recorded.) Tribes without a shaman cannot summon <a href=\"/appendix/element1\">air elementals</a>, which is an important part of aarakocra culture.</p><p>The shaman is the leader of the daily sun worship. Aarakocra worship the sun because it provides them with the thermals they need to soar in search of food. The shaman also leads the mystic rituals used to summon an air elemental. Summoning an air elemental is usually done only in preparation for the tribe's most sacred ceremony, the hunt. Small tribes must band together for this ceremony to allow the triumvirate to be formed.</p><p>The ceremony to summon an air elemental must be conducted at dawn and requires the oldest male and female to emit a highpitched keening whistle. The shaman conducts an intricate dance around them, simultaneously chanting an ancient summoning mantra.</p><p>The hunt is the final part of the initiation of adolescent aarakocra to adulthood and often takes the tribe far from their normal teritory. The target is always a <a href=\"/appendix/drakalsi\">silt drake</a>. The hunt is the only time the females leave the relative safety of the nest. Even an evil tribe will not interfere with a tribe on a hunt. An air elemental is often summoned to help find the drake, but never takes part in the actual combat. Although the adult members of the tribe take part in the initial phases of the combat, it is the initiates who deliver the final, killing blows to me drake. Scars from the hunt are considered a mark of pride among all aarakocra.</p><p>The females spend about eight months of the year incubating their eggs. Athasian aarakocra mate for life and a pair normally produces as many as 10 offspring. A female lays one egg a year. Constant incubation is not required because of the high daytime temperatures, so the females can maintain the nest and keep the tribe's treasure in order.</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Ecology:</b> Athasian aarakocra are high on the food chain and have no natural enemies other than <a href=\"/appendix/drakatha\">drakes</a>. Unless evil, aarakocra leave their own territory only to hunt the silt drake and return as soon as possible when the hunt is over. (Evil aarakocra attack others, as noted above.) Aarakocra eggs and hatchlings are sought after by wealthy land owners who wish to use the creatures as scouts and sentries. An egg can bring as much as 10 cp in Tyr's marketplace. Tribes that have had eggs or hatchlings stolen have long memories and sometimes take revenge against the thief at a later date. Captive aarakocra join any tribe they come in contact with.</p><p>Athasian aarakocra have a natural life span of 21-30 years.</p>\n","images":["<img src=\"grf/ds.gif\" width=\"150\" height=\"75\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Dark Sun\" title=\"Dark Sun\" align=\"right\">","<img src=\"img/aarakath.gif\" alt=\"Aarakocra (Athas)\" title=\"Aarakocra (Athas)\" border=\"0\" width=\"300\" height=\"360\" style=\"text-align:right;\" align=\"right\">","<img src=\"grf/add2_01.gif\" width=\"200\" height=\"56\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Advanced Dungeons & Dragons 2nd Edition\">"],"setting":"Dark Sun","statblock":{"Aarakocra (Athas)":{"Activity Cycle":"Day","Alignment":"Any","Armor Class":"7","Climate/Terrain":"Deep desert","Damage/Attack":"1d3/1d3 or by weapon","Diet":"Carnivore","Frequency":"Rare","Hit Dice":"2+2","Intelligence":"Average (8-10)","Magic Resistance":"Nil","Morale":"Steady (11)","Movement":"6, Fl 36 (C)","No. Appearing":"1d10","No. of Attacks":"2","Organization":"Tribal","Size":"M (20'+ wingspan)","Special Attacks":"Nil","Special Defenses":"Nil","THAC0":"17","Treasure":"Varies","XP Value":"65"}},"title":"Aarakocra (Athas)"},"sources":["2433"],"statblock_names":[],"title":"Aarakocra (Athas)","prev_key":"zygraat","next_key":"aarakocr","monster_path":"/appendix/aarakath"}}},"pageContext":{"monster_key":"ooslje01","monster_data":{"TSR":["2102","2140"],"fullBody":"  <table cellspacing=\"0\" cellpadding=\"0\"><tr class=\"bk\"><th> </th><th class=\"cn\">Ochre Jelly</th><th class=\"cn\">Gray Ooze</th><th class=\"cn\">Crystal Ooze</th><th class=\"cn\">Gelatinous Cube</th><th class=\"cn\">Green Slime</th></tr><tr><th>Climate/Terrain:</th><td>Subterranean</td><td>Subterranean</td><td>Dimly lit water</td><td>Subterranean</td><td>Subterranean</td></tr><tr><th>Frequency:</th><td>Uncommon</td><td>Rare</td><td>Rare</td><td>Uncommon</td><td>Rare</td></tr><tr><th>Organization:</th><td>Solitary</td><td>Solitary</td><td>Solitary</td><td>Solitary</td><td>Colony</td></tr><tr><th>Activity Cycle:</th><td>Any</td><td>Any</td><td>Any</td><td>Any</td><td>Any</td></tr><tr><th>Diet:</th><td>Omnivore</td><td>Omnivore</td><td>Omnivore</td><td>Omnivore</td><td>Omnivore</td></tr><tr><th>Intelligence:</th><td>Non- (0)</td><td>Animal (1)</td><td>Animal (1)</td><td>Non- (0)</td><td>Non- (0)</td></tr><tr><th>Treasure:</th><td>Nil</td><td>Nil</td><td>Nil</td><td>Nil (incidental)</td><td>Nil</td></tr><tr><th>Alignment:</th><td>Neutral</td><td>Neutral</td><td>Neutral</td><td>Neutral</td><td>Neutral</td></tr><tr><th>No. Appearing:</th><td>1-3</td><td>1-3</td><td>1-2</td><td>1</td><td>1-6</td></tr><tr><th>Armor Class:</th><td>8</td><td>8</td><td>8</td><td>8</td><td>9</td></tr><tr><th>Movement:</th><td>3</td><td>1</td><td>1, Sw 3</td><td>6</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><th>Hit Dice:</th><td>6</td><td>3+3</td><td>4</td><td>4</td><td>2</td></tr><tr><th>THAC0:</th><td>15</td><td>17</td><td>17</td><td>17</td><td>19</td></tr><tr><th>No. of Attacks:</th><td>1</td><td>1</td><td>1</td><td>1</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><th>Damage/Attack:</th><td>3-12</td><td>2-16</td><td>4-16</td><td>2-8</td><td>Nil</td></tr><tr><th>Special Attacks:</th><td>Nil</td><td>Corrodes metal</td><td>Poison</td><td>Paralyzation, surprise</td><td>See below</td></tr><tr><th>Special Defenses:</th><td>See below</td><td>See below</td><td>See below</td><td>See below</td><td>See below</td></tr><tr><th>Magic Resistance:</th><td>Nil</td><td>Nil</td><td>Nil</td><td>Nil</td><td>Nil</td></tr><tr><th>Size:</th><td>M (4-7')</td><td>M to L (4-12')</td><td>M to L (4-12')</td><td>L (10' cube)</td><td>S (2-4')</td></tr><tr><th>Morale:</th><td>Average (10)</td><td>Average (10)</td><td>Average (10)</td><td>Average (10)</td><td>Average (10)</td></tr><tr><th>XP Value:</th><td>270</td><td>270</td><td>420</td><td>650</td><td>65</td></tr></table><p class=\"f\">The oozes, slimes and jellies of the underworld are hideous, amorphous creatures that are the bane of all that lives, dissolving the weapons, armor, and flesh of their victims.</p><h2>Ochre Jelly</h2><p class=\"f\">This monster resembles a giant amoeba, seeping through darkened corridors, through cracks and under doors, searching for flesh or cellulose to devour. Their form allows them to travel on walls and ceilings and drop on unsuspecting prey.</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Combat:</b> The ochre jelly attacks by attempting to envelop its prey. Its secretions dissolve flesh, inflicting 3-12 (d10+2) points of damage per round of exposure. While a <i>lightning bolt</i> will divide the creature into one or more smaller jellies, each doing one-half normal damage, fire- and cold-based attacks have normal effects.</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Habitat/Society:</b> An asexual creature, the ochre jelly is a solitary beast that is occasionally found with its own divided offspring. It lives only to eat and reproduce.</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Ecology:</b> Voraciously dissolving all types of carrion and trash, this monster is sometimes tolerated in inhabited subterranean areas for its janitorial services, but this activity is difficult to organize and is usually not appreciated by the inhabitants because of its danger.</p><h2>Gray Ooze</h2><p class=\"f\"><b>Psionics Summary</b></p><table class=\"ip\"><tr class=\"bk\"><th>Level</th><th>Dis/Sci/Dev</th><th>Attack/Defense</th><th>Score</th><th>PSPs</th></tr><tr class=\"cn\"><td>1</td><td>2/1/1</td><td>PsC/M-</td><td>13</td><td>1d100+20</td></tr></table><p class=\"f\">A slimy horror that looks like wet stone or a sedimentary rock formation, the gray ooze is rarely thicker than six or eight inches, but sometimes grows to a length of 12 feet. It cannot climb walls or ceilings, so it slides, drips, and oozes along cavern floors.</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Combat:</b> The gray ooze strikes like a <a href=\"/appendix/snake\">snake</a>, and can corrode metal at an alarming rate (chain mail in one round, plate mail in two, and magical armor in one round per each plus to Armor Class). Spells have no effect on this monster, nor do fire- or cold-based attacks. Lightning and blows from weapons cause full damage. Note that weapons striking a gray ooze may corrode and break.</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Habitat/Society:</b> After a large meal, a gray ooze reproduces by &ldquo;budding&rdquo;: growing a small pod that is left behind in a corridor or cavern. This pod takes two to three days to mature and then the little gray ooze absorbs its leathery shell and begins slithering about, searching for a meal. Sometimes more than one of these monsters are found together, but this is just a random event because they are not intelligent.</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Ecology:</b> The gray ooze is a dungeon scavenger. It is rumored that metalworkers of extraordinary skill keep very small oozes in stone jars to etch and score their metal work, but this is a delicate and dangerous practice.</p><h2>Crystal Ooze</h2><p class=\"f\">This creature is a variety of gray ooze which has adapted to living in water. It is 75% invisible when immersed in its natural element. It is translucent, mostly glassy clear, with an occasional milky white swirl in its substance.</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Combat:</b> Crystal ooze strikes like a snake, then attempts to flow over a victim and exude its paralyzing poison. Unlike its cousin, the gray ooze, this creature does not corrode metal, but its poisons attack wood, cloth, and flesh. Unless a victim successfully saves vs. poison, he becomes paralyzed and will be consumed by the crystal ooze in a short time. When prey is reduced to -20 hit points, it is totally consumed. Crystal ooze cannot be harmed by acid, cold, heat, or fire attacks, but electricity and <i>magic missiles</i> inflict full damage. Blows from weapons inflict only 1 point of damage per hit. A wooden weapon must save vs. acid or it will dissolve and break.</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Habitat/Society:</b> Crystal oozes live in any dim or dark body of water, though they can exist out of water for several hours. They reproduce by budding, like the gray ooze, but the crystal pods usually take seven to 10 days to hatch. Crystal oozes will eat their offspring, but occasionally, if the body of water is large enough and food is not scarce, a few of them might be found living in the same water.</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Ecology:</b> Crystal oozes are scavengers that leave metal and stone objects in their wake, so incidental treasure can often be found around and in their lairs.</p><h2><img src=\"/img/spc/oosljegc.gif\" width=\"300\" height=\"360\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Gelatinous Cube\" title=\"Gelatinous Cube\" style=\"float:left;\">Gelatinous Cube</h2><p class=\"f\">So nearly transparent that they are difficult to see, these cubes travel down dungeon corridors, absorbing carrion and trash along the way. Their sides glisten, tending to leave a slimy trail, but gelatinous cubes cannot climb walls or cling to ceilings. Very large cubes grow tall to garner mosses and the like from ceilings.</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Combat:</b> A gelatinous cube attacks by touching its victim with its anesthetizing slime. A victim who fails to save vs. paralyzation is paralyzed (anesthetized) for 5-20 (5d4) rounds. The cube then surrounds its prey and secretes digestive fluids to absorb the food. All damage is caused by these digestive acids. Because gelatinous cubes are difficult to see, others are -3 on their surprise roll. Electricity, <i>fear</i>, <i>holds</i>, paralyzation, <i>polymorph</i>, and sleep-based attacks have no effect on this monster, but fire and blows from weapons have normal effects. If a cube fails its saving throw against a cold-based attack, the cube will be slowed 50% and inflicts only 1-4 points of damage.</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Habitat/Society:</b> Possessing no intelligence, gelatinous cubes live only for eating. They prefer well- traveled dungeons where there is always food to scavenge. These creatures reproduce by budding, leaving clear, rubbery cubes in dark corners or on heaps of trash. Young are not protected and are sometimes reabsorbed by the parent. Treasure is sometimes swept up by a gelatinous cube as the creature travels along a cavern floor; any metals, gems, or jewelry are carried in the monster's body until they can be ejected as indigestible. Items found inside a cube include treasure types J, K, L, M, N, Q, as well as an occasional potion, dagger, or similar object.</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Ecology:</b> The gelatinous cube is sometimes encouraged to stay in a certain area for its scavenging abilities, and is preferred over other jellies and oozes since its square shape does not allow it to slither under doors and into areas in which it is not desired.</p><h2>Green Slime</h2><p class=\"f\">A hideous growth, green slime is bright green, sticky, and wet. It grows in dark subterranean places on walls, ceilings and floors.</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Combat:</b> This slime cannot attack but is sensitive to vibrations and often drops from the ceiling onto a passing victim. Green slime attaches itself to living flesh and in 1-4 melee rounds turns the creature into green slime (no resurrection possible). Green slime eats through one inch of wood in an hour, but can dissolve metal quickly, going through plate armor in three melee rounds. The horrid growth can be scraped off quickly, cut away, frozen, or burned. A <i>cure disease</i> spell kills green slime, but other attacks, including weapons and spells, have no effect.</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Habitat/Society:</b> Green slime hates light and feeds on animal, vegetable, and metallic substances in dark caverns. Since it cannot move, this slime grows only when food comes to it. Sunlight dries it out and eventually kills it. Occasional huge slimes or colonies of dozens have been reported.</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Ecology:</b> Green slime is an infestation that all creatures avoid; it is burned out of caverns or mines if found. Once it has infected an area, it has a tendency to grow back, even after being frozen or burned away, because dormant spores can germinate years later.</p>\n","images":["<img src=\"grf/xx.gif\" width=\"150\" height=\"75\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Advanced Dungeons & Dragons 2nd Edition\" title=\"Advanced Dungeons & Dragons 2nd Edition\" align=\"right\">","<img src=\"img/ooslje01.gif\" alt=\"Ooze/Slime/Jelly II\" title=\"Ooze/Slime/Jelly II\" border=\"0\" width=\"300\" height=\"360\" style=\"text-align:right;\" align=\"right\">","<img src=\"/img/spc/oosljegc.gif\" width=\"300\" height=\"360\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Gelatinous Cube\" title=\"Gelatinous Cube\" style=\"float:left;\">","<img src=\"grf/tsr_sm.png\" width=\"56\" height=\"59\" border=\"0\" alt=\"TSR\">"],"setting":"Advanced Dungeons & Dragons 2nd Edition","statblock":{"Crystal Ooze":{"Activity Cycle":"Any","Alignment":"Neutral","Armor Class":"8","Climate/Terrain":"Dimly lit water","Damage/Attack":"4-16","Diet":"Omnivore","Frequency":"Rare","Hit Dice":"4","Intelligence":"Animal (1)","Magic Resistance":"Nil","Morale":"Average (10)","Movement":"1, Sw 3","No. Appearing":"1-2","No. of Attacks":"1","Organization":"Solitary","Size":"M to L (4-12')","Special Attacks":"Poison","Special Defenses":"See below","THAC0":"17","Treasure":"Nil","XP Value":"420"},"Gelatinous Cube":{"Activity Cycle":"Any","Alignment":"Neutral","Armor Class":"8","Climate/Terrain":"Subterranean","Damage/Attack":"2-8","Diet":"Omnivore","Frequency":"Uncommon","Hit Dice":"4","Intelligence":"Non- (0)","Magic Resistance":"Nil","Morale":"Average (10)","Movement":"6","No. Appearing":"1","No. of Attacks":"1","Organization":"Solitary","Size":"L (10' cube)","Special Attacks":"Paralyzation, surprise","Special Defenses":"See below","THAC0":"17","Treasure":"Nil (incidental)","XP Value":"650"},"Gray Ooze":{"Activity Cycle":"Any","Alignment":"Neutral","Armor Class":"8","Climate/Terrain":"Subterranean","Damage/Attack":"2-16","Diet":"Omnivore","Frequency":"Rare","Hit Dice":"3+3","Intelligence":"Animal (1)","Magic Resistance":"Nil","Morale":"Average (10)","Movement":"1","No. Appearing":"1-3","No. of Attacks":"1","Organization":"Solitary","Size":"M to L (4-12')","Special Attacks":"Corrodes metal","Special Defenses":"See below","THAC0":"17","Treasure":"Nil","XP Value":"270"},"Green Slime":{"Activity Cycle":"Any","Alignment":"Neutral","Armor Class":"9","Climate/Terrain":"Subterranean","Damage/Attack":"Nil","Diet":"Omnivore","Frequency":"Rare","Hit Dice":"2","Intelligence":"Non- (0)","Magic Resistance":"Nil","Morale":"Average (10)","Movement":"0","No. Appearing":"1-6","No. of Attacks":"0","Organization":"Colony","Size":"S (2-4')","Special Attacks":"See below","Special Defenses":"See below","THAC0":"19","Treasure":"Nil","XP Value":"65"},"Ochre Jelly":{"Activity Cycle":"Any","Alignment":"Neutral","Armor Class":"8","Climate/Terrain":"Subterranean","Damage/Attack":"3-12","Diet":"Omnivore","Frequency":"Uncommon","Hit Dice":"6","Intelligence":"Non- (0)","Magic Resistance":"Nil","Morale":"Average (10)","Movement":"3","No. Appearing":"1-3","No. of Attacks":"1","Organization":"Solitary","Size":"M (4-7')","Special Attacks":"Nil","Special Defenses":"See below","THAC0":"15","Treasure":"Nil","XP Value":"270"}},"title":"Ooze/Slime/Jelly II"},"sources":["2102","2140"],"statblock_names":[],"title":"Ooze/Slime/Jelly II","prev_key":"ooslje00","next_key":"oosljegh","monster_path":"/appendix/ooslje01"}},"staticQueryHashes":[],"slicesMap":{}}
