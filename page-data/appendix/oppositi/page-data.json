While the powers listed above are the most common, some aarakocra have different or additional powers.</p><p class=\"f\">A race of intelligent, birdlike creatures living in the deepest deserts of Athas, the rare Athasian <a href=\"/appendix/aarakocr\">aarakocra</a> spends its time soaring on thermals in search of food.</p><p>The aarakocra is 7 to 8 feet tall with a wingspan of 20 feet or more. Because of its large wingspan, an aarakocra can carry as much as 75% of its own body weight and still fly easily. An aarakocra can fly a short distance carrying a burden equaling 125% of its own body weight. The average body weight of a full grown male is 100 pounds and a female is 85 pounds.</p><p>Each wing has a &ldquo;hand&rdquo; at its midpoint, consisting of three fingers and an opposable thumb. The fourth finger forms the rigid leading edge of the wing. In flight the hands cannot be used, but on the ground the aarakocra can use its hands almost as a human would. The aarakocra's body is protected by a thin bony plate on the chest, much like a solid rib cage. Talons on its legs can be used as claws and can be retracted to reveal a second set of hands, also with three fingers and an opposable thumb. Except for the chest plate, the entire skeleton is hollow and extremely fragile.</p><p>From a distance, the Athasian aarakocra resembles a huge <a href=\"/appendix/bird\">vulture</a>. Its black eyes, set in the front of the head, provide excellent vision over a long range. The plumage is generally black with a white collar for adult males and black or brown with a smaller white collar for females. Adolescents are a mixture of brown and black. The beak is large and covers most of the head. Plumage begins at the crown of the head and is darker near the head, except for the collar. Athasian aarakocra speak their own language and the languages of vultures and other large birds. Some speak the common tongue (5% to 10% chance depending on how deep in the wastelands a tribe lives).</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Combat:</b> Aarakocra can fight in the air or on the ground. They prefer aerial combat since their bones are too fragile to withstand a solid blow from a human-sized opponent. In combat against creatures on the ground, they prefer to fly over their victim and drop weighted nets. Some aarakocra use darts to harass ground-based opponents.</p><p>If their opponents can fly, the aarakocra generally forgo the use of the net, although large groups sometimes use nets on flying creatures. Normally, aarakocra attack flying creatures with long spears, diving from above and allowing the momentum to carry the spear through the target. Such an attack doubles the damage if the aarakocra have been able to dive at least 50 feet. Only the very largest aarakocra can carry more than one of these spears, they can attack with both at once with no penalty, causing double damage on each strike. All diving attacks are made at +4 and should be treated as a charge attack. All other penalties and restrictions of charge attacks apply.</p><p>The effect of the aarakocra's nets depends on if the opponent is flying at the time it becomes entangled. Creatures on the ground that are hit by a net are entangled and unable to participate in any combat until they make a successful Strength check to get free of the net. Flying creatures hit by a net can no longer fly and immediately begin falling. If they cannot escape the net or use some magical means to arrest the fall, normal falling damage applies.</p><p>Unless victims are entangled in nets, aarakocra are cautious in ground combat. If the aarakocra outnumber their opponents they advance in a straight line and thrust with their spears. If outnumbered, or the opponents are particularly tough, the aarakocra withdraw. Victims entangled in nets are killed or incapacitated for use as food or ransom.</p><p>Athasian aarakocra are mindful of their physical limitations as well as their comparatively low psionic abilities. They do not normally initiate psionic combat. At the first sign of psionic powers from any of their victims, however, all aarakocra that have some ability will use whatever attack and defense modes they can in an attempt to destroy the threat. Large groups of is or more aarakocra may initiate psionic combat if their leaders feel they can win quickly and avoid physical combat.</p><p>In desperation, an aarakocra can attempt to bite an opponent in combat. Because of the unwieldiness of its beak, the aarakocra has a THAC0 of 18 if attacking with this appendage. Further, the birdman causes only 1d2 points of damage with the beak.</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Habitat/Society:</b> Athasian aarakocra live in tribes with 6-20 (2d8+4) members, depending on the prestige of the leader. The largest tribe ever recorded had 50 members. The tribal hunting territory depends on the size of the tribe, usually about 500 square miles for a tribe of 10 members. There are no rigid boundaries between tribes and border disputes are not uncommon.</p><p>Alignments of tribe members are similar to the alignment of the leader. A tribe that has a leader who is neutral good may have neutral good, chaotic good, lawful good, and true neutral members. A predominantly evil tribe does not recognize boundaries with other tribes and treats other tribes as inferior beings to be eliminated.</p><p>Athasian aarakocra aren't happy in enclosed spaces, but they they take refuge in a cave or building if necessary.</p><p>Nonevil tribes live in rocky aeries in the highest peaks they can find. Evil tribes are normally nomadic and use an aerie made by another tribe if they need to remain in an area for a long time, even if they have to evict the tribe that made the nest.</p><p>Aarakocra aren't friendly toward intruders in their territory, especially caravans. They try to extract a toll from the caravan for passage through the desert. Good-aligned tribes allow unhindered passage of caravans that pay a tribute. If someone refuses to pay the tribute, the aarakocra try to capture scouts or outriders from the party and hold them until an even larger tribute is paid. The payment may be either livestock or shiny objects. Aarakocra are smart enough not to be taken in by glass baubles instead of gems, although they cannot tell the difference between the more common gems and the rare ones.</p><p>Evil tribes ask for tribute and often attack a caravan whether it pays or not. Aarakocra always demand shiny objects such as stones. These tribes find humans and demihumans to be quite tasty and prefer them to other food.</p><p>Good-aligned tribes of aarakocra sometimes return a lost traveler to the edge of the desert after first removing any valuables the traveler may be carrying. On very rare occasions a tribe might return a lost group of travelers to the more frequently traveled parts of the desert, again after first taking any valuables as payment.</p><p>The oldest male is the leader of the tribal hunting party and has 4+4 Hit Dice. The oldest female is in charge of the tribal aerie and has 3+3 HD. In tribes that have more than 15 members, the next oldest aarakocra serves as shaman and has 3+3 HD; the shaman completes the triumvirate necessary for proper worship and the summoning of elementals. (Interestingly, no magic-using aarakocra has ever been recorded.) Tribes without a shaman cannot summon <a href=\"/appendix/element1\">air elementals</a>, which is an important part of aarakocra culture.</p><p>The shaman is the leader of the daily sun worship. Aarakocra worship the sun because it provides them with the thermals they need to soar in search of food. The shaman also leads the mystic rituals used to summon an air elemental. Summoning an air elemental is usually done only in preparation for the tribe's most sacred ceremony, the hunt. Small tribes must band together for this ceremony to allow the triumvirate to be formed.</p><p>The ceremony to summon an air elemental must be conducted at dawn and requires the oldest male and female to emit a highpitched keening whistle. The shaman conducts an intricate dance around them, simultaneously chanting an ancient summoning mantra.</p><p>The hunt is the final part of the initiation of adolescent aarakocra to adulthood and often takes the tribe far from their normal teritory. The target is always a <a href=\"/appendix/drakalsi\">silt drake</a>. The hunt is the only time the females leave the relative safety of the nest. Even an evil tribe will not interfere with a tribe on a hunt. An air elemental is often summoned to help find the drake, but never takes part in the actual combat. Although the adult members of the tribe take part in the initial phases of the combat, it is the initiates who deliver the final, killing blows to me drake. Scars from the hunt are considered a mark of pride among all aarakocra.</p><p>The females spend about eight months of the year incubating their eggs. Athasian aarakocra mate for life and a pair normally produces as many as 10 offspring. A female lays one egg a year. Constant incubation is not required because of the high daytime temperatures, so the females can maintain the nest and keep the tribe's treasure in order.</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Ecology:</b> Athasian aarakocra are high on the food chain and have no natural enemies other than <a href=\"/appendix/drakatha\">drakes</a>. Unless evil, aarakocra leave their own territory only to hunt the silt drake and return as soon as possible when the hunt is over. (Evil aarakocra attack others, as noted above.) Aarakocra eggs and hatchlings are sought after by wealthy land owners who wish to use the creatures as scouts and sentries. An egg can bring as much as 10 cp in Tyr's marketplace. Tribes that have had eggs or hatchlings stolen have long memories and sometimes take revenge against the thief at a later date. Captive aarakocra join any tribe they come in contact with.</p><p>Athasian aarakocra have a natural life span of 21-30 years.</p><p></p><br clear=\"all\" style=\"clear:both; height:0;\">\r\n","images":["<img src=\"grf/ds.gif\" width=\"150\" height=\"75\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Dark Sun\" title=\"Dark Sun\" align=\"right\">","<img src=\"img/aarakath.gif\" alt=\"Aarakocra (Athas)\" title=\"Aarakocra (Athas)\" border=\"0\" width=\"300\" height=\"360\" style=\"text-align:right;\" align=\"right\">","<img src=\"grf/add2_01.gif\" width=\"200\" height=\"56\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Advanced Dungeons & Dragons 2nd Edition\">"],"setting":"Dark Sun","statblock":{"Aarakocra (Athas)":{"Activity Cycle":"Day","Alignment":"Any","Armor Class":"7","Climate/Terrain":"Deep desert","Damage/Attack":"1d3/1d3 or by weapon","Diet":"Carnivore","Frequency":"Rare","Hit Dice":"2+2","Intelligence":"Average (8-10)","Magic Resistance":"Nil","Morale":"Steady (11)","Movement":"6, Fl 36 (C)","No. Appearing":"1d10","No. of Attacks":"2","Organization":"Tribal","Size":"M (20'+ wingspan)","Special Attacks":"Nil","Special Defenses":"Nil","THAC0":"17","Treasure":"Varies","XP Value":"65"}},"title":"Aarakocra (Athas)"},"sources":["2433"],"statblock_names":[],"title":"Aarakocra (Athas)","prev_key":"zygraat","next_key":"aarakocr","monster_path":"/appendix/aarakath"}}},"pageContext":{"monster_key":"oppositi","monster_data":{"TSR":["2635"],"fullBody":"  <table cellspacing=\"0\" cellpadding=\"0\"><tr><th>Climate/Terrain:</th>  <td>Inner Planes</td></tr><tr><th>Frequency:</th>        <td>Very rare</td></tr><tr><th>Organization:</th>     <td>Sect</td></tr><tr><th>Activity Cycle:</th>   <td>Any</td></tr><tr><th>Diet:</th>             <td>Omnivorous</td></tr><tr><th>Intelligence:</th>     <td>Low to genius (5- 18)</td></tr><tr><th>Treasure:</th>         <td>P, L, Q</td></tr><tr><th>Alignment:</th>        <td>Varies (generally neutral)</td></tr><tr><th>No. Appearing:</th>    <td>1d6</td></tr><tr><th>Armor Class:</th>      <td>Varies (4)</td></tr><tr><th>Movement:</th>         <td>Varies (1 2)</td></tr><tr><th>Hit Dice:</th>         <td>Varies (4d 10)</td></tr><tr><th>THAC0:</th>            <td>Varies (17)</td></tr><tr><th>No. of Attacks:</th>   <td>Varies (1)</td></tr><tr><th>Damage/Attack:</th>    <td>By weapon</td></tr><tr><th>Special Attacks:</th>  <td>Varies</td></tr><tr><th>Special Defenses:</th> <td>Varies</td></tr><tr><th>Magic Resistance:</th> <td>Varies (nil)</td></tr><tr><th>Size:</th>             <td>Varies (M)</td></tr><tr><th>Morale:</th>           <td>Elite to fanatic (14- 18)</td></tr><tr><th>XP Value:</th>         <td>Varies</td></tr></table><p class=\"f\">Strength comes from adversity. Adversity comes from struggle. Struggle comes from enemies. Enemies come from opposing natures. For every action there is an equal and opposite reaction. Every force, every idea, every object has its opposite.</p><p>Anything that is can be defined by its opposites; therefore, opposites give meaning. Without an opposite - without forces working against an object - the object atrophies and grows weak.</p><p>Opposition brings conflict. from conflict, a body gains knowledge, power, and confidence. Tbe weak are culled so that the strong can grow even stronger.</p><p>The Opposition is a group of people who believe these things to be true. They're not a full-fledged faction, but merely one of the sects that litter the planes. However, they live on the Inner Planes, where the clash of opposites is the most obvious and dramatic. Earth hates air and fire hates water, each destroying the other in an eternal conflict that makes the multiverse possible - at least, according to the Opposition.</p><p>Whoever a body is, whatever she believes, the Opposition are her enemies. They oppose everyone and everything. They do so not out of belligerence, but to strengthen both themselves and everyone and everything else. Want to improve something? Give it something to struggle against - that's the Opposition's way.</p><p>When a cutter runs into the Opposition, it's best to assume the worst. More than likely, they're going to try to stop him from whatever he's doing. The only hope he's got is if the Opposers are already busy opposing someone or something else.</p><p>Nothing is beyond the scope of the Opposition's beliefs. Some of the bannier of them seek to oppose the laws of reality themselves. For ultimate strength, they believe, a body's got to undertake the ultimate struggles.</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Combat:</b> A typical Opposer is a fighter. (Thus, stats for a 4th-level fighter Opposer are given above in parentheses.) An Opposer has only one special sect ability, but it's a potent one. One time each day, a member of this sect can successfully oppose another's action. For example, an Opposer can block a blow, stop a runner, or counter an argument. This ability has three requirements: it must oppose the action of another thinking being (a sect member can't oppose an avalanche.), it must have a means (blocking a blow with a shield, grappling a fleeing foe, dodging a thrown boulder, and so on), and it must be within the realm of possibility (DM's discretion).</p><p>A player character Opposer (if permitted by the DM) should always be required to state the means of the opposition, providing a ratfonale for how it can successfully occur. Opposition must be declared before any die rolls are made (if applicable). In other words, when the berk chooses to oppose an action, he doesn't even know if that action is going to succeed on its own - it might fail to without the Opposer's help.</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Habitat/Society:</b> The organization of this sect is particularly loose. Tiny little contingents within the group keep it divided, enoush so that there is virtually no chance of them ever becoming as large or as powerful as one of Sigil's factions. Unfortunately, many of the Opposers spend their time opposing each other.</p><p>Each contingent of the sect lives in one of the Inner Planes, with many favoring the Elemental Plane of Air due to their inability to dwell in most of the other planes longterm without a significant amount of magical aid. Nonetheless, most. Opposers travel through even (or perhaps especially) the most inhospitable planes for as long as they possibly can, whenever they can, because they believe that they gain strength from such adversity.</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Ecology:</b> The Opposers are a small sect. Their members are almost always non-Inner Planes natives, so in terms of those planes, the Opposition is a very small factor indeed. Nevettheless, in isolated areas they are a potent force, respected (or feared) by those around them.</p><h2>The Opposition</h2><p class=\"f\"><b>Faction Philosophy:</b> Whatever <i>you</i> think is wrong. Greatness comes from hardship, and hardship can be brought about through conmct. Ideas, objects, and people are constantly honed to ultimate perfection by clashfog with their opposites. Agreement is weakness.</p><p>Here's a tip for planewalkers who encounter an Opposer: Don't try the old \"turn their belief on themselves trick.\" and tell an Opposer that if he really opposes everything, then he opposes himself and his own beliefs too. Every member of the sect has heard that one, and the most common response is, \"Now you're getting the idea, berk!\" punctuated by a punch in the face. Their rationale is that, yes, they even oppose their own beliefs - or rather, they'd like others to oppose them, in order to make them stronger. Every belief must be challenged, constantly.</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Primary Plane of Influence:</b> All of the Inner Planes are equally important to the Opposition, though occasionally one splinter group or another within the sect declares that one element is stronger than another, causing other groups to - surprise, surprise - oppose them. These. sorts of activities are short-term and do more to encourage conflict than actually espouse a real preference for one plane. Opposers are rarely found on the Outer Planes. While they enjoy the dash of alignments and beliefs common to those planes, they prefer the more conspicuous manifestation of their beliefs in opposites embodied by the Inner Planes.</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Allies and Enemies:</b> The Godsmen, who believe in the endless testing of everyone, understand the Opposers' love of adversity. Likewise, both the Fated and the Bleak Cabal agree in the idea that life is a struggle and that the strong should survive. However, the Opposition, due to the sect's very nature, has no allies. Nor does the sect want them. They oppose the beliefs of all other factions and sects (which makes them a little like the Anarchists, though the two groups still aren't allies). It's been said that if the Opposers were stronger or more significant, the other factions would bring them down on principal alone.</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Eligibility:</b> Only those who are truly neutral in alignment may become Opposers. It's simply too easy for someone aligned with good or evil, law or chaos, to become motivated by intentions that they should actually be opposing.</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Benefits:</b> Opposers gain the ability mentioned above in the \"Combat\" section.</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Restrictions:</b> The many drawbacks to being a member of the Opposition are probably obvious. No one likes them, thinking them to be belligerent, contrary, and unfriendly. (All true.) This opinion levies a -2 penalty to all reaction rolls made by non-Opposers. Further, no Opposer can ever espouse any belief, opinion, motivation, or outlook other than that of the Opposition, except to oppose the belief of someone else. Black is white - unless someone says it's white, in which case it's black</p><p></p><br clear=\"all\" style=\"clear:both; height:0;\">\r\n","images":["<img src=\"grf/ps.gif\" width=\"150\" height=\"75\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Planescape\" title=\"Planescape\" align=\"right\">","<img src=\"img/oppositi.gif\" alt=\"Opposition\" title=\"Opposition\" border=\"0\" width=\"300\" height=\"360\" style=\"text-align:right;\" align=\"right\">","<img src=\"grf/tsr_sm.png\" width=\"56\" height=\"59\" border=\"0\" alt=\"TSR\">"],"setting":"Planescape","statblock":{"Opposition":{"Activity Cycle":"Any","Alignment":"Varies (generally neutral)","Armor Class":"Varies (4)","Climate/Terrain":"Inner Planes","Damage/Attack":"By weapon","Diet":"Omnivorous","Frequency":"Very rare","Hit Dice":"Varies (4d 10)","Intelligence":"Low to genius (5- 18)","Magic Resistance":"Varies (nil)","Morale":"Elite to fanatic (14- 18)","Movement":"Varies (1 2)","No. Appearing":"1d6","No. of Attacks":"Varies (1)","Organization":"Sect","Size":"Varies (M)","Special Attacks":"Varies","Special Defenses":"Varies","THAC0":"Varies (17)","Treasure":"P, L, Q","XP Value":"Varies"}},"title":"Opposition"},"sources":["2635"],"statblock_names":[],"title":"Opposition","prev_key":"opinicus","next_key":"orc","monster_path":"/appendix/oppositi"}},"staticQueryHashes":[],"slicesMap":{}}
