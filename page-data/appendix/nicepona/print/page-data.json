While the powers listed above are the most common, some aarakocra have different or additional powers.</p><p class=\"f\">A race of intelligent, birdlike creatures living in the deepest deserts of Athas, the rare Athasian <a href=\"/appendix/aarakocr\">aarakocra</a> spends its time soaring on thermals in search of food.</p><p>The aarakocra is 7 to 8 feet tall with a wingspan of 20 feet or more. Because of its large wingspan, an aarakocra can carry as much as 75% of its own body weight and still fly easily. An aarakocra can fly a short distance carrying a burden equaling 125% of its own body weight. The average body weight of a full grown male is 100 pounds and a female is 85 pounds.</p><p>Each wing has a &ldquo;hand&rdquo; at its midpoint, consisting of three fingers and an opposable thumb. The fourth finger forms the rigid leading edge of the wing. In flight the hands cannot be used, but on the ground the aarakocra can use its hands almost as a human would. The aarakocra's body is protected by a thin bony plate on the chest, much like a solid rib cage. Talons on its legs can be used as claws and can be retracted to reveal a second set of hands, also with three fingers and an opposable thumb. Except for the chest plate, the entire skeleton is hollow and extremely fragile.</p><p>From a distance, the Athasian aarakocra resembles a huge <a href=\"/appendix/bird\">vulture</a>. Its black eyes, set in the front of the head, provide excellent vision over a long range. The plumage is generally black with a white collar for adult males and black or brown with a smaller white collar for females. Adolescents are a mixture of brown and black. The beak is large and covers most of the head. Plumage begins at the crown of the head and is darker near the head, except for the collar. Athasian aarakocra speak their own language and the languages of vultures and other large birds. Some speak the common tongue (5% to 10% chance depending on how deep in the wastelands a tribe lives).</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Combat:</b> Aarakocra can fight in the air or on the ground. They prefer aerial combat since their bones are too fragile to withstand a solid blow from a human-sized opponent. In combat against creatures on the ground, they prefer to fly over their victim and drop weighted nets. Some aarakocra use darts to harass ground-based opponents.</p><p>If their opponents can fly, the aarakocra generally forgo the use of the net, although large groups sometimes use nets on flying creatures. Normally, aarakocra attack flying creatures with long spears, diving from above and allowing the momentum to carry the spear through the target. Such an attack doubles the damage if the aarakocra have been able to dive at least 50 feet. Only the very largest aarakocra can carry more than one of these spears, they can attack with both at once with no penalty, causing double damage on each strike. All diving attacks are made at +4 and should be treated as a charge attack. All other penalties and restrictions of charge attacks apply.</p><p>The effect of the aarakocra's nets depends on if the opponent is flying at the time it becomes entangled. Creatures on the ground that are hit by a net are entangled and unable to participate in any combat until they make a successful Strength check to get free of the net. Flying creatures hit by a net can no longer fly and immediately begin falling. If they cannot escape the net or use some magical means to arrest the fall, normal falling damage applies.</p><p>Unless victims are entangled in nets, aarakocra are cautious in ground combat. If the aarakocra outnumber their opponents they advance in a straight line and thrust with their spears. If outnumbered, or the opponents are particularly tough, the aarakocra withdraw. Victims entangled in nets are killed or incapacitated for use as food or ransom.</p><p>Athasian aarakocra are mindful of their physical limitations as well as their comparatively low psionic abilities. They do not normally initiate psionic combat. At the first sign of psionic powers from any of their victims, however, all aarakocra that have some ability will use whatever attack and defense modes they can in an attempt to destroy the threat. Large groups of is or more aarakocra may initiate psionic combat if their leaders feel they can win quickly and avoid physical combat.</p><p>In desperation, an aarakocra can attempt to bite an opponent in combat. Because of the unwieldiness of its beak, the aarakocra has a THAC0 of 18 if attacking with this appendage. Further, the birdman causes only 1d2 points of damage with the beak.</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Habitat/Society:</b> Athasian aarakocra live in tribes with 6-20 (2d8+4) members, depending on the prestige of the leader. The largest tribe ever recorded had 50 members. The tribal hunting territory depends on the size of the tribe, usually about 500 square miles for a tribe of 10 members. There are no rigid boundaries between tribes and border disputes are not uncommon.</p><p>Alignments of tribe members are similar to the alignment of the leader. A tribe that has a leader who is neutral good may have neutral good, chaotic good, lawful good, and true neutral members. A predominantly evil tribe does not recognize boundaries with other tribes and treats other tribes as inferior beings to be eliminated.</p><p>Athasian aarakocra aren't happy in enclosed spaces, but they they take refuge in a cave or building if necessary.</p><p>Nonevil tribes live in rocky aeries in the highest peaks they can find. Evil tribes are normally nomadic and use an aerie made by another tribe if they need to remain in an area for a long time, even if they have to evict the tribe that made the nest.</p><p>Aarakocra aren't friendly toward intruders in their territory, especially caravans. They try to extract a toll from the caravan for passage through the desert. Good-aligned tribes allow unhindered passage of caravans that pay a tribute. If someone refuses to pay the tribute, the aarakocra try to capture scouts or outriders from the party and hold them until an even larger tribute is paid. The payment may be either livestock or shiny objects. Aarakocra are smart enough not to be taken in by glass baubles instead of gems, although they cannot tell the difference between the more common gems and the rare ones.</p><p>Evil tribes ask for tribute and often attack a caravan whether it pays or not. Aarakocra always demand shiny objects such as stones. These tribes find humans and demihumans to be quite tasty and prefer them to other food.</p><p>Good-aligned tribes of aarakocra sometimes return a lost traveler to the edge of the desert after first removing any valuables the traveler may be carrying. On very rare occasions a tribe might return a lost group of travelers to the more frequently traveled parts of the desert, again after first taking any valuables as payment.</p><p>The oldest male is the leader of the tribal hunting party and has 4+4 Hit Dice. The oldest female is in charge of the tribal aerie and has 3+3 HD. In tribes that have more than 15 members, the next oldest aarakocra serves as shaman and has 3+3 HD; the shaman completes the triumvirate necessary for proper worship and the summoning of elementals. (Interestingly, no magic-using aarakocra has ever been recorded.) Tribes without a shaman cannot summon <a href=\"/appendix/element1\">air elementals</a>, which is an important part of aarakocra culture.</p><p>The shaman is the leader of the daily sun worship. Aarakocra worship the sun because it provides them with the thermals they need to soar in search of food. The shaman also leads the mystic rituals used to summon an air elemental. Summoning an air elemental is usually done only in preparation for the tribe's most sacred ceremony, the hunt. Small tribes must band together for this ceremony to allow the triumvirate to be formed.</p><p>The ceremony to summon an air elemental must be conducted at dawn and requires the oldest male and female to emit a highpitched keening whistle. The shaman conducts an intricate dance around them, simultaneously chanting an ancient summoning mantra.</p><p>The hunt is the final part of the initiation of adolescent aarakocra to adulthood and often takes the tribe far from their normal teritory. The target is always a <a href=\"/appendix/drakalsi\">silt drake</a>. The hunt is the only time the females leave the relative safety of the nest. Even an evil tribe will not interfere with a tribe on a hunt. An air elemental is often summoned to help find the drake, but never takes part in the actual combat. Although the adult members of the tribe take part in the initial phases of the combat, it is the initiates who deliver the final, killing blows to me drake. Scars from the hunt are considered a mark of pride among all aarakocra.</p><p>The females spend about eight months of the year incubating their eggs. Athasian aarakocra mate for life and a pair normally produces as many as 10 offspring. A female lays one egg a year. Constant incubation is not required because of the high daytime temperatures, so the females can maintain the nest and keep the tribe's treasure in order.</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Ecology:</b> Athasian aarakocra are high on the food chain and have no natural enemies other than <a href=\"/appendix/drakatha\">drakes</a>. Unless evil, aarakocra leave their own territory only to hunt the silt drake and return as soon as possible when the hunt is over. (Evil aarakocra attack others, as noted above.) Aarakocra eggs and hatchlings are sought after by wealthy land owners who wish to use the creatures as scouts and sentries. An egg can bring as much as 10 cp in Tyr's marketplace. Tribes that have had eggs or hatchlings stolen have long memories and sometimes take revenge against the thief at a later date. Captive aarakocra join any tribe they come in contact with.</p><p>Athasian aarakocra have a natural life span of 21-30 years.</p><p></p><br clear=\"all\" style=\"clear:both; height:0;\">\r\n","images":["<img src=\"grf/ds.gif\" width=\"150\" height=\"75\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Dark Sun\" title=\"Dark Sun\" align=\"right\">","<img src=\"img/aarakath.gif\" alt=\"Aarakocra (Athas)\" title=\"Aarakocra (Athas)\" border=\"0\" width=\"300\" height=\"360\" style=\"text-align:right;\" align=\"right\">","<img src=\"grf/add2_01.gif\" width=\"200\" height=\"56\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Advanced Dungeons & Dragons 2nd Edition\">"],"setting":"Dark Sun","statblock":{"Aarakocra (Athas)":{"Activity Cycle":"Day","Alignment":"Any","Armor Class":"7","Climate/Terrain":"Deep desert","Damage/Attack":"1d3/1d3 or by weapon","Diet":"Carnivore","Frequency":"Rare","Hit Dice":"2+2","Intelligence":"Average (8-10)","Magic Resistance":"Nil","Morale":"Steady (11)","Movement":"6, Fl 36 (C)","No. Appearing":"1d10","No. of Attacks":"2","Organization":"Tribal","Size":"M (20'+ wingspan)","Special Attacks":"Nil","Special Defenses":"Nil","THAC0":"17","Treasure":"Varies","XP Value":"65"}},"title":"Aarakocra (Athas)"},"sources":["2433"],"statblock_names":[],"title":"Aarakocra (Athas)","prev_key":"zygraat","next_key":"aarakocr","monster_path":"/appendix/aarakath"}}},"pageContext":{"monster_key":"nicepona","monster_data":{"TSR":["2600"],"fullBody":"  <table cellspacing=\"0\" cellpadding=\"0\"><tr><th>Climate/Terrain:</th><td>Any plane</td></tr><tr><th>Frequency:</th><td>Very rare</td></tr><tr><th>Organization:</th><td>Solitary or herd</td></tr><tr><th>Activity Cycle:</th><td>Any</td></tr><tr><th>Diet:</th><td>Herbivore</td></tr><tr><th>Intelligence:</th><td>Exceptional (15-16)</td></tr><tr><th>Treasure:</th><td>Nil</td></tr><tr><th>Alignment:</th><td>Neutral</td></tr><tr><th>No. Appearing:</th><td>1 or 5d10</td></tr><tr><th>Armor Class:</th><td>2</td></tr><tr><th>Movement:</th><td>24</td></tr><tr><th>Hit Dice:</th><td>7</td></tr><tr><th>THAC0:</th><td>13</td></tr><tr><th>No. of Attacks:</th><td>3 (hoof/hoof/bite) or 1 (back kick)</td></tr><tr><th>Damage/Attack:</th><td>1d8/1d8/1d4 or 3d8</td></tr><tr><th>Special Attacks:</th><td>See below</td></tr><tr><th>Special Defenses:</th><td>See below</td></tr><tr><th>Magic Resistance:</th><td>30%</td></tr><tr><th>Size:</th><td>L</td></tr><tr><th>Morale:</th><td>Champion (15)</td></tr><tr><th>XP Value:</th><td>2,000</td></tr></table><p class=\"f\">Nic'Epona, also known as Epona's daughters, are among a few creatures with the ability to move between the planes at will. They are, rumor says, direct descendants of the horse-goddess Epona, and they derive their power from her. They are the defenders of her realm, Tir na Og (on the Outlands), and they ride in massive waves to overwhelm those who would threaten her.</p><p>The nic'Epona resemble ordinary <a href=\"/appendix/horse\">horses</a> almost exactly, although there is a sparkle of intelligence behind their eyes that belies the aspect of a common animal. They can appear in any color of the rainbow (stories are told of those whose color is beyond the deepest violet or above the brightest red), and they have an innate ability to change their coloration at will. Usually they adopt one color or color-pattern as their favorite, but they can change their hide to any hue as the mood takes them.</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Combat:</b> The nic'Epona, as the defenders of Epona's realm, are naturally fierce foes in combat. Each uses her hooves and her powerful teeth to good effect. They willingly bite those foolish enough to come close without permission, and their sharp forehooves can strike as powerfully as a battle axe. If there is an opponent behind her, a nic'Epona may choose to deliver a powerful kick with her hind legs. (However, this means the nic'Epona forgoes any other attack that round, as she spends the round bracing and balancing herself for the delivery of this mighty blow.) A nic'Epona attacks as though her entire body were a +2 weapon, allowing her to hit those beings that take damage only from magic or silver. Note that the nic'Epona do not actually gain the +2 bonus to hit or damage, but merely have the ability to hit creatures immune to lesser weapons.</p><p>When in a herd of 20 or greater, the nic'Epona can also create a stampede to sweep over their enemies. The stampede is 20 yards wide and at least two nic'Epona deep (one nic'Epona every two yards). Each additional group of 10 nic'Epona widens the stampede by 20 yards or adds another rank of the creatures - they spread out according to the number of opponents arrayed against them. The steeds charge without fear and never need to check Morale in a stampede. They require 50 yards to build up good speed, at which point anyone in their path suffers 10d6 points of damage per round for a number of rounds equal to the number of ranks of nic'Epona, divided by 4 (round up). For example, if there are three ranks of nic'Epona, anyone in their path suffers 10d6 points of damage for a single round. If there are eight ranks, opponents suffer 10d6 points for two rounds. Victims are allowed a save vs. spell for half damage.</p><p>The nic'Epona also boast an impressive defense. They can be hit only by weapons of +2 or greater power, or by those whose innate abilities allow them to strike as a +2 weapon, like themselves.</p><p>They are also completely immune to <i>charm</i>-related spells, and they're aware of it when someone attempts to use magic to gain their trust. Even magical items that charm animals have no effect on the nic'Epona, for they are not normal horses. However, since this immunity is not widely known, the nic'Epona delight in pretending to fall under the sway of such magic, then abandoning the caster on an unfriendly plane. often in a bad situation.</p><p>The most striking feature of the nic'Epona defense is their ability to <i>plane shift</i> (as the spell) at will, requiring but a few steps in which to work the magic. They can travel to any point in any of the Outer Planes that they have seen, although realms of unfriendly powers are closed to them unless they're specifically invited. If combat is not going her way, a nic'Epona takes a few steps back, charges at her foe, and plane shifts just before contact, leaving a rainbow silhouette that fades after a few moments. Her hooves glow with a faint purple fire when she activates this power.</p><p>Finally, nic'Epona are able to keep their footing on any surface, from water to quicksand to air. Their hooves create an momentary causeway upon which they gallop, giving the impression that they are flying, running across water, or performing some other apparently impossible feat. They can even run up vertical surfaces, treating the transition from horizontal to vertical as just another step. (This can be a bit jarring for riders who are unused to it.) The nic'Epona can activate this &ldquo;fleeting causeway&rdquo; for one turn/hour; when they do so, their hooves flare with a bright blue flame. No creature other than the nic'Epona can use the causeway (except a rider).</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Habitat/Society:</b> Though they appear to be solitary creatures, nic'Epona gather in great herds in the realm of Tir na Og, on the Outlands. Though they have free rein through the planes, they call Tir na Og home because it is the home of their patron power, Epona. When they are at home, they have little to do with the planars, primes, and petitioners who come to them for favors or transport through the planes. Since they have the company of their own kind in Tir na Og, they do not need that of ordinary mortals. They break this rule only for those they call friends, or for those whom they owe a debt of honor.</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Ecology:</b> Nic'Epona are all female, despite persistent rumors of male nic'Epona. They are produced by the union of a nic'Epona with a male equine (a horse, <a href=\"/appendix/pegasus\">pegasus</a>, or <a href=\"/appendix/unicorn\">unicorn</a>). The offspring of such a union are nic'Epona if female, but take after the father if they are male. The herd is extremely protective of its foals and will turn en masse on anyone who attempts the theft of one, harrying the thief through the planes if necessary.</p><p>Epona's daughters are gregarious, enjoying the company and attentions of other beings. Occasionally they will come into contact with adventurer-types, engaging them in conversation in an attempt to learn interesting gossip and places to travel. If treated well and entertained, each nic'Epona may offer to carry a person from one plane to another.</p><p>Those who would ride one of Epona's daughters should have fine gifts and flattering words to court her affections. They must first win her trust, for if she has faith in the rider, she will provide transport - one time and one time only - to the destination of the rider's choice. If the rider does something to betray this trust, the nic'Epona can easily deposit the rider in some inhospitable plane. Baator is a favorite stopping point for nic'Epona burdened with irksome riders.</p><p>If the nic'Epona is particularly well-treated, or learns devotion for a being, she will allow that being to name her. Thereafter, she will respond to the name, treating it as a summons up to three times (more at the DM's discretion, though DMs should be advised that even three times is an exceptional number). She will arrive within 1d10 rounds, galloping across the planes to bear her friend away from whatever danger menaces.</p><p></p><br clear=\"all\" style=\"clear:both; height:0;\">\r\n","images":["<img src=\"grf/ps.gif\" width=\"150\" height=\"75\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Planescape\" title=\"Planescape\" align=\"right\">","<img src=\"img/nicepona.gif\" alt=\"Nic'Epona\" title=\"Nic'Epona\" border=\"0\" width=\"300\" height=\"360\" style=\"text-align:right;\" align=\"right\">","<img src=\"grf/add2_01.gif\" width=\"200\" height=\"56\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Advanced Dungeons & Dragons 2nd Edition\">"],"setting":"Planescape","statblock":{"Nic'Epona":{"Activity Cycle":"Any","Alignment":"Neutral","Armor Class":"2","Climate/Terrain":"Any plane","Damage/Attack":"1d8/1d8/1d4 or 3d8","Diet":"Herbivore","Frequency":"Very rare","Hit Dice":"7","Intelligence":"Exceptional (15-16)","Magic Resistance":"30%","Morale":"Champion (15)","Movement":"24","No. Appearing":"1 or 5d10","No. of Attacks":"3 (hoof/hoof/bite) or 1 (back kick)","Organization":"Solitary or herd","Size":"L","Special Attacks":"See below","Special Defenses":"See below","THAC0":"13","Treasure":"Nil","XP Value":"2,000"}},"title":"Nic'Epona"},"sources":["2600"],"statblock_names":[],"title":"Nic'Epona","prev_key":"nethbird","next_key":"nighagst","monster_path":"/appendix/nicepona"}},"staticQueryHashes":[],"slicesMap":{}}
