While the powers listed above are the most common, some aarakocra have different or additional powers.</p><p class=\"f\">A race of intelligent, birdlike creatures living in the deepest deserts of Athas, the rare Athasian <a href=\"/appendix/aarakocr\">aarakocra</a> spends its time soaring on thermals in search of food.</p><p>The aarakocra is 7 to 8 feet tall with a wingspan of 20 feet or more. Because of its large wingspan, an aarakocra can carry as much as 75% of its own body weight and still fly easily. An aarakocra can fly a short distance carrying a burden equaling 125% of its own body weight. The average body weight of a full grown male is 100 pounds and a female is 85 pounds.</p><p>Each wing has a &ldquo;hand&rdquo; at its midpoint, consisting of three fingers and an opposable thumb. The fourth finger forms the rigid leading edge of the wing. In flight the hands cannot be used, but on the ground the aarakocra can use its hands almost as a human would. The aarakocra's body is protected by a thin bony plate on the chest, much like a solid rib cage. Talons on its legs can be used as claws and can be retracted to reveal a second set of hands, also with three fingers and an opposable thumb. Except for the chest plate, the entire skeleton is hollow and extremely fragile.</p><p>From a distance, the Athasian aarakocra resembles a huge <a href=\"/appendix/bird\">vulture</a>. Its black eyes, set in the front of the head, provide excellent vision over a long range. The plumage is generally black with a white collar for adult males and black or brown with a smaller white collar for females. Adolescents are a mixture of brown and black. The beak is large and covers most of the head. Plumage begins at the crown of the head and is darker near the head, except for the collar. Athasian aarakocra speak their own language and the languages of vultures and other large birds. Some speak the common tongue (5% to 10% chance depending on how deep in the wastelands a tribe lives).</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Combat:</b> Aarakocra can fight in the air or on the ground. They prefer aerial combat since their bones are too fragile to withstand a solid blow from a human-sized opponent. In combat against creatures on the ground, they prefer to fly over their victim and drop weighted nets. Some aarakocra use darts to harass ground-based opponents.</p><p>If their opponents can fly, the aarakocra generally forgo the use of the net, although large groups sometimes use nets on flying creatures. Normally, aarakocra attack flying creatures with long spears, diving from above and allowing the momentum to carry the spear through the target. Such an attack doubles the damage if the aarakocra have been able to dive at least 50 feet. Only the very largest aarakocra can carry more than one of these spears, they can attack with both at once with no penalty, causing double damage on each strike. All diving attacks are made at +4 and should be treated as a charge attack. All other penalties and restrictions of charge attacks apply.</p><p>The effect of the aarakocra's nets depends on if the opponent is flying at the time it becomes entangled. Creatures on the ground that are hit by a net are entangled and unable to participate in any combat until they make a successful Strength check to get free of the net. Flying creatures hit by a net can no longer fly and immediately begin falling. If they cannot escape the net or use some magical means to arrest the fall, normal falling damage applies.</p><p>Unless victims are entangled in nets, aarakocra are cautious in ground combat. If the aarakocra outnumber their opponents they advance in a straight line and thrust with their spears. If outnumbered, or the opponents are particularly tough, the aarakocra withdraw. Victims entangled in nets are killed or incapacitated for use as food or ransom.</p><p>Athasian aarakocra are mindful of their physical limitations as well as their comparatively low psionic abilities. They do not normally initiate psionic combat. At the first sign of psionic powers from any of their victims, however, all aarakocra that have some ability will use whatever attack and defense modes they can in an attempt to destroy the threat. Large groups of is or more aarakocra may initiate psionic combat if their leaders feel they can win quickly and avoid physical combat.</p><p>In desperation, an aarakocra can attempt to bite an opponent in combat. Because of the unwieldiness of its beak, the aarakocra has a THAC0 of 18 if attacking with this appendage. Further, the birdman causes only 1d2 points of damage with the beak.</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Habitat/Society:</b> Athasian aarakocra live in tribes with 6-20 (2d8+4) members, depending on the prestige of the leader. The largest tribe ever recorded had 50 members. The tribal hunting territory depends on the size of the tribe, usually about 500 square miles for a tribe of 10 members. There are no rigid boundaries between tribes and border disputes are not uncommon.</p><p>Alignments of tribe members are similar to the alignment of the leader. A tribe that has a leader who is neutral good may have neutral good, chaotic good, lawful good, and true neutral members. A predominantly evil tribe does not recognize boundaries with other tribes and treats other tribes as inferior beings to be eliminated.</p><p>Athasian aarakocra aren't happy in enclosed spaces, but they they take refuge in a cave or building if necessary.</p><p>Nonevil tribes live in rocky aeries in the highest peaks they can find. Evil tribes are normally nomadic and use an aerie made by another tribe if they need to remain in an area for a long time, even if they have to evict the tribe that made the nest.</p><p>Aarakocra aren't friendly toward intruders in their territory, especially caravans. They try to extract a toll from the caravan for passage through the desert. Good-aligned tribes allow unhindered passage of caravans that pay a tribute. If someone refuses to pay the tribute, the aarakocra try to capture scouts or outriders from the party and hold them until an even larger tribute is paid. The payment may be either livestock or shiny objects. Aarakocra are smart enough not to be taken in by glass baubles instead of gems, although they cannot tell the difference between the more common gems and the rare ones.</p><p>Evil tribes ask for tribute and often attack a caravan whether it pays or not. Aarakocra always demand shiny objects such as stones. These tribes find humans and demihumans to be quite tasty and prefer them to other food.</p><p>Good-aligned tribes of aarakocra sometimes return a lost traveler to the edge of the desert after first removing any valuables the traveler may be carrying. On very rare occasions a tribe might return a lost group of travelers to the more frequently traveled parts of the desert, again after first taking any valuables as payment.</p><p>The oldest male is the leader of the tribal hunting party and has 4+4 Hit Dice. The oldest female is in charge of the tribal aerie and has 3+3 HD. In tribes that have more than 15 members, the next oldest aarakocra serves as shaman and has 3+3 HD; the shaman completes the triumvirate necessary for proper worship and the summoning of elementals. (Interestingly, no magic-using aarakocra has ever been recorded.) Tribes without a shaman cannot summon <a href=\"/appendix/element1\">air elementals</a>, which is an important part of aarakocra culture.</p><p>The shaman is the leader of the daily sun worship. Aarakocra worship the sun because it provides them with the thermals they need to soar in search of food. The shaman also leads the mystic rituals used to summon an air elemental. Summoning an air elemental is usually done only in preparation for the tribe's most sacred ceremony, the hunt. Small tribes must band together for this ceremony to allow the triumvirate to be formed.</p><p>The ceremony to summon an air elemental must be conducted at dawn and requires the oldest male and female to emit a highpitched keening whistle. The shaman conducts an intricate dance around them, simultaneously chanting an ancient summoning mantra.</p><p>The hunt is the final part of the initiation of adolescent aarakocra to adulthood and often takes the tribe far from their normal teritory. The target is always a <a href=\"/appendix/drakalsi\">silt drake</a>. The hunt is the only time the females leave the relative safety of the nest. Even an evil tribe will not interfere with a tribe on a hunt. An air elemental is often summoned to help find the drake, but never takes part in the actual combat. Although the adult members of the tribe take part in the initial phases of the combat, it is the initiates who deliver the final, killing blows to me drake. Scars from the hunt are considered a mark of pride among all aarakocra.</p><p>The females spend about eight months of the year incubating their eggs. Athasian aarakocra mate for life and a pair normally produces as many as 10 offspring. A female lays one egg a year. Constant incubation is not required because of the high daytime temperatures, so the females can maintain the nest and keep the tribe's treasure in order.</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Ecology:</b> Athasian aarakocra are high on the food chain and have no natural enemies other than <a href=\"/appendix/drakatha\">drakes</a>. Unless evil, aarakocra leave their own territory only to hunt the silt drake and return as soon as possible when the hunt is over. (Evil aarakocra attack others, as noted above.) Aarakocra eggs and hatchlings are sought after by wealthy land owners who wish to use the creatures as scouts and sentries. An egg can bring as much as 10 cp in Tyr's marketplace. Tribes that have had eggs or hatchlings stolen have long memories and sometimes take revenge against the thief at a later date. Captive aarakocra join any tribe they come in contact with.</p><p>Athasian aarakocra have a natural life span of 21-30 years.</p><p></p><br clear=\"all\" style=\"clear:both; height:0;\">\r\n","images":["<img src=\"grf/ds.gif\" width=\"150\" height=\"75\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Dark Sun\" title=\"Dark Sun\" align=\"right\">","<img src=\"img/aarakath.gif\" alt=\"Aarakocra (Athas)\" title=\"Aarakocra (Athas)\" border=\"0\" width=\"300\" height=\"360\" style=\"text-align:right;\" align=\"right\">","<img src=\"grf/add2_01.gif\" width=\"200\" height=\"56\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Advanced Dungeons & Dragons 2nd Edition\">"],"setting":"Dark Sun","statblock":{"Aarakocra (Athas)":{"Activity Cycle":"Day","Alignment":"Any","Armor Class":"7","Climate/Terrain":"Deep desert","Damage/Attack":"1d3/1d3 or by weapon","Diet":"Carnivore","Frequency":"Rare","Hit Dice":"2+2","Intelligence":"Average (8-10)","Magic Resistance":"Nil","Morale":"Steady (11)","Movement":"6, Fl 36 (C)","No. Appearing":"1d10","No. of Attacks":"2","Organization":"Tribal","Size":"M (20'+ wingspan)","Special Attacks":"Nil","Special Defenses":"Nil","THAC0":"17","Treasure":"Varies","XP Value":"65"}},"title":"Aarakocra (Athas)"},"sources":["2433"],"statblock_names":[],"title":"Aarakocra (Athas)","prev_key":"zygraat","next_key":"aarakocr","monster_path":"/appendix/aarakath"}}},"pageContext":{"monster_key":"lycanthg","monster_data":{"TSR":["Dragon266"],"fullBody":"  <table cellspacing=\"0\" cellpadding=\"0\"><tr><th>Climate/Terrain:</th>  <td>As giant type</td></tr><tr><th>Frequency:</th>        <td>Very rare</td></tr><tr><th>Organization:</th>     <td>Solitary</td></tr><tr><th>Activity Cycle:</th>   <td>Full moon, and nights preceding and following it</td></tr><tr><th>Diet:</th>             <td>As lycanthrope type</td></tr><tr><th>Intelligence:</th>     <td>As giant type</td></tr><tr><th>Treasure:</th>         <td>As giant type</td></tr><tr><th>Alignment:</th>        <td>As lycanthrope</td></tr><tr><th>No. Appearing:</th>    <td>1</td></tr><tr><th>Armor Class:</th>      <td>As lycanthrope</td></tr><tr><th>Movement:</th>         <td>As giant type</td></tr><tr><th>Hit Dice:</th>         <td>Either normal giant type Hit Dice or double the Hit Dice of lycanthrope type, whichever is greater.</td></tr><tr><th>THAC0:</th>            <td>As giant or lycanthrope, whichever is better, with a +1 bonus</td></tr><tr><th>No. of Attacks:</th>   <td>As lycanthrope</td></tr><tr><th>Damage/Attack:</th>    <td>Double the damage of comparable lycanthrope attack</td></tr><tr><th>Special Attacks:</th>  <td>As lycanthrope type</td></tr><tr><th>Special Defenses:</th> <td>As lycanthrope type</td></tr><tr><th>Magic Resistance:</th> <td>As giant and lycanthrope types</td></tr><tr><th>Size:</th>             <td>As giant type; some (10%) will experience a 20% reduction in size</td></tr><tr><th>Morale:</th>           <td>As lycanthrope type</td></tr><tr><th>XP Value:</th>         <td>The value of the giant type, plus the value of the lycanthrope type</td></tr></table><p class=\"f\">The statistics above refer to the giant werecreature in its \"hybrid\" form. While in giant form, giant werecreatures follow standard statistics for their giant type; when in animal form (where applicable), giant werecreatures follow all the rules for \"Giant Mammals\" listed under the \"<a href=\"/appendix/mammal\">Mammals</a>\" entry in the <i>MONSTROUS MANUAL</i> tome.</p><p>Giant lycanthropes are enlarged versions of their werecreature cousins, the result of an attack from a smaller <a href=\"/appendix/lycanthr\">lycanthrope</a> type; they are typically \"infected\" or \"cursed\" lycanthropes, subject to the phases of the moon just as normal infected lycanthropes. Giant lycanthropes usually have some telling features (besides size) that mark them as members of a certain giant type; these are detailed below. Only certain giants-usually those designated \"giant-kin,\" smaller and more humanoidcan contract lycanthropy; any giant with 15 or more Hit Dice is susceptible to it. Outside of this limitation, giant lycanthropes can entail a wide variety of combinations, from firbolg <a href=\"/appendix/lycawera\">wererats</a> to voadkyn <a href=\"/appendix/lycasewo\">seawolves</a> and every combination in between; the various types are listed below, along with individual rules and restrictions.</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Cyclops and Cyclopskin:</b> The smaller <a href=\"/appendix/giancycl\">cyclopskin</a> are susceptible to all forms of lycanthropy, and their stats in werecreature form echo that of the lycanthrope type exactly. The larger cyclopes generally find themselves inflicted with either <a href=\"/appendix/lycawebe\">bear</a> or <a href=\"/appendix/lycawebt\">bat</a> lycanthropy, because the caves in which they prefer to make their homes most commonly attract those creatures. Other types of lycanthropy are rare but possible; however, a cyclops cannot contract <a href=\"/appendix/lycawefo\">fox</a>, <a href=\"/appendix/lycaweti\">tiger</a>, or seawolf lycanthropy, nor any of the more exotic types. Cyclopskin or cyclopes in hybrid or animal forms are easy to identify because of the distinctive single eye, which they maintain in their transformed shape. This single eye does not hinder the hybrid or animal forms. In addition, a cyclops werebat cannot change into a giant animal form; it is limited to the hybrid form, and in this state it cannot fly; the cyclops still grows wings, however, and can glide through the air if it drops from a height.</p><p>Cyclops \"communities\" (such as they are) tend to drive out those afflicted with lycanthropy, since the creatures feed on the flocks cyclopes keep. Usually, giant werecreature cyclopes encountered by PCs represent such outcast creatures.</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Desert:</b> <a href=\"/appendix/giandese\">Desert giants</a> already suffer under the burden of a curse, one that slowly turns them to stone. This curse apparently supercedes lycanthropy, making them immune to the affliction. Presumably, if a desert giant managed to break its curse, it might become susceptible to lycanthropy, though to which forms and to what degree remains unknown.</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Ettin:</b> <a href=\"/appendix/gianetti\">Ettins</a> can contract wolf, rat, or boar lycanthropy only, and they suffer from one restriction: They cannot assume a full animal form. This seems to be a result of their multiple heads; a lycanthropic ettin retains its two heads in hybrid, which limits the change its body can make. These twin heads also make the lycanthropic ettin a true danger-an ettin werecreature with a bite attack gains two such attacks each round, each with the ability to pass on its dread affliction.</p><p>In some (10%), the lycanthropy affects one, but not both, of the ettin's heads. In these instances, the unaffected head (usually the \"less dominant\") loses control of its body to the affected head. It is often as afraid- if not more so-than those the affected ettin terrorizes.</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Firbolg:</b> The normally noble <a href=\"/appendix/gianfirb\">firbolg</a> are especially susceptible to lycanthropy due in part to their extreme physical similarities to humans. Firbolg can contract nearly all possible forms of lycanthropy except <a href=\"/appendix/lycawerv\">raven</a>, and they gain all the forms and abilities of the lycanthrope type. Infected firbolg are objects of extreme pity in firbolg communities; if an infected firbolg is discovered, the community will rally around the victim, pooling all their resources to seek out a cure.</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Formorian:</b> <a href=\"/appendix/gianform\">Formorian</a> giants are a warped pastiche of body parts and body types. This condition apparently protects them from lycanthropy; no formorian has ever been known to contract the curse.</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Fog:</b> <a href=\"/appendix/gianfog\">Fog giants</a> have never been known to contract lycanthropy, possibly due to either their Huge (24'+) stature, their close relation to the immune <a href=\"/appendix/gianclou\">cloud giants</a>, or both. Whether it is possible for fog giants to contract the affliction remains to be determined.</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Frost:</b> The bitter lands the <a href=\"/appendix/gianfros\">frost giants</a> inhabit are hospitable to only two form of lycanthrope-bear and seawolf- and the frost giant is susceptible to both. A frost giant sea wolf is a notoriously dangerous predator in the iceberg-filled waters of many northern realms, and most captains will go out of their way to assure they do not sail on the night of a full moon. Frost giant werebears change into a giant white <a href=\"/appendix/bear\">polar bear</a>. Frost giants are also one of two giant types known to have true lycanthropes among their ranks; these also shift only into the form of giant polar bears. (See the <a href=\"/appendix/lycagbear\">Lycanthrope, Giant Werebear</a> entry.)</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Hill:</b> <a href=\"/appendix/gianhill\">Hill giants</a> are fully susceptible to most kinds of lycanthropy, excluding raven. Most commonly they contract <a href=\"/appendix/lycawewo\">wolf</a>, <a href=\"/appendix/lycawebo\">boar</a>, rat, or bat. Hill giant lycanthropes tend to be overly broad and awkward, and as such they suffer a -2 penalty to their movement rates in both hybrid and animal forms.</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Jungle:</b> The <a href=\"/appendix/gianjung\">jungle giant</a> is susceptible to any form of lycanthropy found within its environment, especially fox, tiger, and bat, as well as most feline forms of lycanthropy, like the <a href=\"/appendix/lycawele\">wereleopard</a> and <a href=\"/appendix/lycawejr\">werecheetah</a> (both of which are detailed in the MONSTROUS COMPENDIUM: RAVENLOFT III Appendix). In fact, jungle giants afflicted with some form of feline lycanthropy should be considered only \"Rare,\" in relation to all other forms of lycanthropy, appearing twice as often in infected jungle giants as any other type. The jungle giant's unusually thin figure, while amply appropriate for the lithe feline forms it normally changes into, hinders its hybrid forms, causing a 2-Hit-Dice reduction to the hybrid form of all types of jungle giant werecreatures.</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Stone:</b> Though less than 15 Hit Dice, the <a href=\"/appendix/gianston\">stone giant</a> is as solid and resilient as its namesake, and as such stone giants are immune to all forms of lycanthropy.</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Verbeeg:</b> The <a href=\"gianverb\">verbeeg</a>, like the firbolg, are very human-like, and like the firbolg share their susceptibility to lycanthropy. Verbeeg, therefore, can fall prey to any form of lycanthropy, excluding raven. Verbeeg tend to react violently to infected lycanthropes among their ranks; where cyclopes tend to drive victims away and firbolg band together to seek a cure, verbeeg will actively seek out and destroy sush creatures within their tribe.</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Wood:</b> The <a href=\"/appendix/gianwood\">voadkyn</a>, being related to <a href=\"/appendix/elf\">elves</a>, share the elves' susceptibility to all forms of lycanthropy. In addition, voadkyn are the only giants (besides frost giants) who share their ranks with true lycanthropes; these are the feared and hated <a href=\"/appendix/lycagbat\">shadkyn</a>. (See the Lycanthrope, Giant Werebat entry.)</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Combat:</b> Generally, a giant lycanthrope will employ all the same methods of aittack normal lycanthropes do, and causing double the damage. In addition to this, the giant lycanthrope's Large or Huge size allows it some additional forms of attack against Medium and Small creatures. One of these is a grabbing attack, which any Huge giant werecreature can employ against a size Small target. In lieu of a claw attack, the giant may attempt to grab a Small opponent for no damage, but with the option of biting the captured creature automatically the next round (no THAC0 roll required). Small creatures can break free of the grab with a successful Bend Bars/Lift Gates check. Against Medium-sized creatures, the move can be employed, but the giant lycanthrope needs to grab the target creature with both hands to successfully bite the next round.</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Curing Lycanthropy:</b> All the normal means of curing lycanthropy apply to giants and giant-kin as well, though some things must be modified to account for the giant's size - specifically, a giant werecreature must eat a much larger amount of belladonna within 24 hours of contracting the disease to cure it than a normal humanoid would require. In addition, giants with 10 or more Hit Dice have a slim chance of \"curing\" themselves of lycanthropy during every full moon; as they feel the effects of the lycanthropy taking over their bodies, they can try to resist with a 5% chance of success. If a giant cures itself this way, it usually retains some small measure of the lycanthropy inside of it, manifesting in extra body hair or animalistic features- in effect, taking on a slight physical resemblance to the animal type, much like true lycanthropes.</p>\n","images":["<img src=\"grf/dm.gif\" width=\"150\" height=\"75\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Dragon Magazine\" title=\"Dragon Magazine\" align=\"right\">","<img src=\"img/lycanthg.gif\" alt=\"Lycanthrope, Weregiant, General Information\" title=\"Lycanthrope, Weregiant, General Information\" border=\"0\" width=\"300\" height=\"360\" style=\"text-align:right;\" align=\"right\">","<img src=\"grf/tsr_sm.png\" width=\"56\" height=\"59\" border=\"0\" alt=\"TSR\">"],"setting":"Dragon Magazine","title":"Lycanthrope, Weregiant, General Information"},"sources":["Dragon266"],"statblock_names":[],"title":"Lycanthrope, Weregiant, General Information","prev_key":"lycalyth","next_key":"lycanthr","monster_path":"/appendix/lycanthg"}},"staticQueryHashes":[],"slicesMap":{}}
