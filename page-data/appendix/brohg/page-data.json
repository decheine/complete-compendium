While the powers listed above are the most common, some aarakocra have different or additional powers.</p><p class=\"f\">A race of intelligent, birdlike creatures living in the deepest deserts of Athas, the rare Athasian <a href=\"/appendix/aarakocr\">aarakocra</a> spends its time soaring on thermals in search of food.</p><p>The aarakocra is 7 to 8 feet tall with a wingspan of 20 feet or more. Because of its large wingspan, an aarakocra can carry as much as 75% of its own body weight and still fly easily. An aarakocra can fly a short distance carrying a burden equaling 125% of its own body weight. The average body weight of a full grown male is 100 pounds and a female is 85 pounds.</p><p>Each wing has a &ldquo;hand&rdquo; at its midpoint, consisting of three fingers and an opposable thumb. The fourth finger forms the rigid leading edge of the wing. In flight the hands cannot be used, but on the ground the aarakocra can use its hands almost as a human would. The aarakocra's body is protected by a thin bony plate on the chest, much like a solid rib cage. Talons on its legs can be used as claws and can be retracted to reveal a second set of hands, also with three fingers and an opposable thumb. Except for the chest plate, the entire skeleton is hollow and extremely fragile.</p><p>From a distance, the Athasian aarakocra resembles a huge <a href=\"/appendix/bird\">vulture</a>. Its black eyes, set in the front of the head, provide excellent vision over a long range. The plumage is generally black with a white collar for adult males and black or brown with a smaller white collar for females. Adolescents are a mixture of brown and black. The beak is large and covers most of the head. Plumage begins at the crown of the head and is darker near the head, except for the collar. Athasian aarakocra speak their own language and the languages of vultures and other large birds. Some speak the common tongue (5% to 10% chance depending on how deep in the wastelands a tribe lives).</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Combat:</b> Aarakocra can fight in the air or on the ground. They prefer aerial combat since their bones are too fragile to withstand a solid blow from a human-sized opponent. In combat against creatures on the ground, they prefer to fly over their victim and drop weighted nets. Some aarakocra use darts to harass ground-based opponents.</p><p>If their opponents can fly, the aarakocra generally forgo the use of the net, although large groups sometimes use nets on flying creatures. Normally, aarakocra attack flying creatures with long spears, diving from above and allowing the momentum to carry the spear through the target. Such an attack doubles the damage if the aarakocra have been able to dive at least 50 feet. Only the very largest aarakocra can carry more than one of these spears, they can attack with both at once with no penalty, causing double damage on each strike. All diving attacks are made at +4 and should be treated as a charge attack. All other penalties and restrictions of charge attacks apply.</p><p>The effect of the aarakocra's nets depends on if the opponent is flying at the time it becomes entangled. Creatures on the ground that are hit by a net are entangled and unable to participate in any combat until they make a successful Strength check to get free of the net. Flying creatures hit by a net can no longer fly and immediately begin falling. If they cannot escape the net or use some magical means to arrest the fall, normal falling damage applies.</p><p>Unless victims are entangled in nets, aarakocra are cautious in ground combat. If the aarakocra outnumber their opponents they advance in a straight line and thrust with their spears. If outnumbered, or the opponents are particularly tough, the aarakocra withdraw. Victims entangled in nets are killed or incapacitated for use as food or ransom.</p><p>Athasian aarakocra are mindful of their physical limitations as well as their comparatively low psionic abilities. They do not normally initiate psionic combat. At the first sign of psionic powers from any of their victims, however, all aarakocra that have some ability will use whatever attack and defense modes they can in an attempt to destroy the threat. Large groups of is or more aarakocra may initiate psionic combat if their leaders feel they can win quickly and avoid physical combat.</p><p>In desperation, an aarakocra can attempt to bite an opponent in combat. Because of the unwieldiness of its beak, the aarakocra has a THAC0 of 18 if attacking with this appendage. Further, the birdman causes only 1d2 points of damage with the beak.</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Habitat/Society:</b> Athasian aarakocra live in tribes with 6-20 (2d8+4) members, depending on the prestige of the leader. The largest tribe ever recorded had 50 members. The tribal hunting territory depends on the size of the tribe, usually about 500 square miles for a tribe of 10 members. There are no rigid boundaries between tribes and border disputes are not uncommon.</p><p>Alignments of tribe members are similar to the alignment of the leader. A tribe that has a leader who is neutral good may have neutral good, chaotic good, lawful good, and true neutral members. A predominantly evil tribe does not recognize boundaries with other tribes and treats other tribes as inferior beings to be eliminated.</p><p>Athasian aarakocra aren't happy in enclosed spaces, but they they take refuge in a cave or building if necessary.</p><p>Nonevil tribes live in rocky aeries in the highest peaks they can find. Evil tribes are normally nomadic and use an aerie made by another tribe if they need to remain in an area for a long time, even if they have to evict the tribe that made the nest.</p><p>Aarakocra aren't friendly toward intruders in their territory, especially caravans. They try to extract a toll from the caravan for passage through the desert. Good-aligned tribes allow unhindered passage of caravans that pay a tribute. If someone refuses to pay the tribute, the aarakocra try to capture scouts or outriders from the party and hold them until an even larger tribute is paid. The payment may be either livestock or shiny objects. Aarakocra are smart enough not to be taken in by glass baubles instead of gems, although they cannot tell the difference between the more common gems and the rare ones.</p><p>Evil tribes ask for tribute and often attack a caravan whether it pays or not. Aarakocra always demand shiny objects such as stones. These tribes find humans and demihumans to be quite tasty and prefer them to other food.</p><p>Good-aligned tribes of aarakocra sometimes return a lost traveler to the edge of the desert after first removing any valuables the traveler may be carrying. On very rare occasions a tribe might return a lost group of travelers to the more frequently traveled parts of the desert, again after first taking any valuables as payment.</p><p>The oldest male is the leader of the tribal hunting party and has 4+4 Hit Dice. The oldest female is in charge of the tribal aerie and has 3+3 HD. In tribes that have more than 15 members, the next oldest aarakocra serves as shaman and has 3+3 HD; the shaman completes the triumvirate necessary for proper worship and the summoning of elementals. (Interestingly, no magic-using aarakocra has ever been recorded.) Tribes without a shaman cannot summon <a href=\"/appendix/element1\">air elementals</a>, which is an important part of aarakocra culture.</p><p>The shaman is the leader of the daily sun worship. Aarakocra worship the sun because it provides them with the thermals they need to soar in search of food. The shaman also leads the mystic rituals used to summon an air elemental. Summoning an air elemental is usually done only in preparation for the tribe's most sacred ceremony, the hunt. Small tribes must band together for this ceremony to allow the triumvirate to be formed.</p><p>The ceremony to summon an air elemental must be conducted at dawn and requires the oldest male and female to emit a highpitched keening whistle. The shaman conducts an intricate dance around them, simultaneously chanting an ancient summoning mantra.</p><p>The hunt is the final part of the initiation of adolescent aarakocra to adulthood and often takes the tribe far from their normal teritory. The target is always a <a href=\"/appendix/drakalsi\">silt drake</a>. The hunt is the only time the females leave the relative safety of the nest. Even an evil tribe will not interfere with a tribe on a hunt. An air elemental is often summoned to help find the drake, but never takes part in the actual combat. Although the adult members of the tribe take part in the initial phases of the combat, it is the initiates who deliver the final, killing blows to me drake. Scars from the hunt are considered a mark of pride among all aarakocra.</p><p>The females spend about eight months of the year incubating their eggs. Athasian aarakocra mate for life and a pair normally produces as many as 10 offspring. A female lays one egg a year. Constant incubation is not required because of the high daytime temperatures, so the females can maintain the nest and keep the tribe's treasure in order.</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Ecology:</b> Athasian aarakocra are high on the food chain and have no natural enemies other than <a href=\"/appendix/drakatha\">drakes</a>. Unless evil, aarakocra leave their own territory only to hunt the silt drake and return as soon as possible when the hunt is over. (Evil aarakocra attack others, as noted above.) Aarakocra eggs and hatchlings are sought after by wealthy land owners who wish to use the creatures as scouts and sentries. An egg can bring as much as 10 cp in Tyr's marketplace. Tribes that have had eggs or hatchlings stolen have long memories and sometimes take revenge against the thief at a later date. Captive aarakocra join any tribe they come in contact with.</p><p>Athasian aarakocra have a natural life span of 21-30 years.</p><p></p><br clear=\"all\" style=\"clear:both; height:0;\">\r\n","images":["<img src=\"grf/ds.gif\" width=\"150\" height=\"75\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Dark Sun\" title=\"Dark Sun\" align=\"right\">","<img src=\"img/aarakath.gif\" alt=\"Aarakocra (Athas)\" title=\"Aarakocra (Athas)\" border=\"0\" width=\"300\" height=\"360\" style=\"text-align:right;\" align=\"right\">","<img src=\"grf/add2_01.gif\" width=\"200\" height=\"56\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Advanced Dungeons & Dragons 2nd Edition\">"],"setting":"Dark Sun","statblock":{"Aarakocra (Athas)":{"Activity Cycle":"Day","Alignment":"Any","Armor Class":"7","Climate/Terrain":"Deep desert","Damage/Attack":"1d3/1d3 or by weapon","Diet":"Carnivore","Frequency":"Rare","Hit Dice":"2+2","Intelligence":"Average (8-10)","Magic Resistance":"Nil","Morale":"Steady (11)","Movement":"6, Fl 36 (C)","No. Appearing":"1d10","No. of Attacks":"2","Organization":"Tribal","Size":"M (20'+ wingspan)","Special Attacks":"Nil","Special Defenses":"Nil","THAC0":"17","Treasure":"Varies","XP Value":"65"}},"title":"Aarakocra (Athas)"},"sources":["2433"],"statblock_names":[],"title":"Aarakocra (Athas)","prev_key":"zygraat","next_key":"aarakocr","monster_path":"/appendix/aarakath"}}},"pageContext":{"monster_key":"brohg","monster_data":{"TSR":["2405"],"fullBody":"  <table cellspacing=\"0\" cellpadding=\"0\"><tr><th>Climate/Terrain:</th><td>Any</td></tr><tr><th>Frequency:</th><td>Common</td></tr><tr><th>Organization:</th><td>Bands or cliques</td></tr><tr><th>Activity Cycle:</th><td>Any</td></tr><tr><th>Diet:</th><td>Omnivore</td></tr><tr><th>Intelligence:</th><td>Low (5-7)</td></tr><tr><th>Treasure:</th><td>J,K</td></tr><tr><th>Alignment:</th><td>Neutral</td></tr><tr><th>No. Appearing:</th><td>1-12</td></tr><tr><th>Armor Class:</th><td>7 (10)</td></tr><tr><th>Movement:</th><td>15</td></tr><tr><th>Hit Dice:</th><td>5+3</td></tr><tr><th>THAC0:</th><td>15</td></tr><tr><th>No. of Attacks:</th><td>4</td></tr><tr><th>Damage/Attack:</th><td>11-18 (1d8+10)</td></tr><tr><th>Special Attacks:</th><td>See below</td></tr><tr><th>Special Defenses:</th><td>See below</td></tr><tr><th>Magic Resistance:</th><td>See below</td></tr><tr><th>Size:</th><td>H (15' tall)</td></tr><tr><th>Morale:</th><td>Average (10)</td></tr><tr><th>XP Value:</th><td>650<br>Leader: 975<br>Renegade: 975</td></tr></table><p class=\"f\">These multi-armed, humanoid kin to <a href=\"/appendix/giantath\">giants</a> are often hunted for combat in the gladiatorial arenas of Athas due to their strength, size, and special combat abilities.</p><p>B'rohg are tall, slim, humanoid giants with four arms and two legs. They have burnt orange skin, the result of having spent their lives on the hot deserts of Athas. They stand 15' in height when fully mature, with sharp, angled features, a flat nose, and pointed ears located towards the backside of their skull. Some b'rohg are bald on top, but do have hair (which they will grow to waist-length) growing from the back of their heads. B'rohg have no facial hair. A b'rohg's garb is simple and well-suited to his primitive lifestyle. Males and females alike wear loose fitting skins or breeches made from reptilian leather.</p><p>B'rohg communicate with one another through a series of primitive grunts and hand signals. Because of their low intelligence, it is impossible to teach a b'rohg contemporary speech. It is possible to learn the grunt and sign language of the b'rohg through much study; however, such communication tends to be limited to simple concepts. Psionic or magical communication is also somewhat limited due to their low intelligence - contact is still limited to fairly simple ideas.</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Combat:</b> Naturally ambidextrous and very strong, b'rohg are highly prized for arena combat. B'rohg are formidable opponents due to their ability to make four separate attacks per round. The primary two attacks are unmodified. The other two attacks are attempted with a -2 attack roll penalty. B'rohg prefer to fight with primitive stone weapons, such as spears and clubs, but will use any available weapon. A favored form of attack is wielding clubs in the lower two arms and long spears in the upper arms. While most younger b'rohg favor an all-out, 4-weapon attack, some older b'rohg prefer to pad their lower two arms and use them as shields, thus &ldquo;equalizing&rdquo; the match. Using the latter method, b'rohg get two chances to parry while still making two attacks.</p><p>Because of their lack of intellectual development, b'rohg have never mastered the use of missile weapons other than those which can be thrown (rocks, etc.). Because of the motion of throwing, a b'rohg can only throw a maximum of two objects per round, and they do so by throwing from the same side simultaneously.</p><p>There will be a dominant male leader present in any group of six or more b'rohg. The leader has 6+3 Hit Dice and a THAC0 of 13. The leader also brings his battle savvy into play, directing the combat actions of his warriors. When a leader is present, the b'rohg are more likely to set ambushes for approaching enemies rather than conduct a simple frontal assault. Also, b'rohg under the command of a leader will turn and run after losing two of their original number. Otherwise b.rohg tend to fight to the bitter end.</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Habitat/Society:</b> B'rohg are a throw-back to simpler times. They are nomadic hunters and gatherers who continue to live within a primitive, &ldquo;stone age&rdquo; culture primarily because of their low intelligence. A b'rohg child taken and raised in a human community is unable to comprehend anything but primitive concepts; his lack of intelligence makes him unable to excel. B'rohg live in small bands comprised of 1-4 family units called cliques. Family units consist of one male, one or two females, and generally no more than four total offspring. Males are dominant within the family structure, but tasks within a band are accomplished by the most capable member regardless of gender. The strongest in the band are primarily hunters, while the older, weaker members and the children are gatherers and water bearers. B'rohg have yet to master fire, but are not afraid of it; in fact, they are often attracted to it if they see the distant glow. B'rohg are scavengers, and their clothing often testifies to this fact. When clothed, they combine animal skins with &ldquo;found&rdquo; or discarded scraps of clothing and armor.</p><p>B'rohg typically live to be 80 years of age but seldom do because of the harshness of their environment and a high mortality rate among their young. B'rohg do not understand the concept of death and tend to leave things that do not exhibit signs of life alone. An exception to this is seen in combat, where they may repeatedly strike a dead opponent just to make sure it does not arise later. B'rohg will eat the flesh of other races, but are not cannibalistic; they do not consume their own kind.</p><p>Neither suspicious nor superstitious, b'rohg are reactionary when magic is used in their presence. Depending on previous experiences with spellcasters, the creatures may be awed or angered. When encountering magic for the first time, their reaction tends to be one of curiosity (until the spellcaster's intent - malevolent or benevolent - has been established).</p><p>Their nomadic lifestyle calls for periods of movement followed by periods of rest. While on the move, the adults carry the few belongings they have and their children in simple sleds made from skins or leathers stretched across a triangle of wooden poles. Each adult drags a single sled across the ground to the next temporary settlement. Once in an area fresh for further hunting and gathering, the group settles down, forming small hovels out of their sleds and additional skins. Where possible, the hovels use existing rocks and crevices to serve as walls or additional rooms, respectively. When under the direction of a dominant male leader, the group selects an easily defended position over any others.</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Ecology:</b> B'rohg do not directly contribute to the social or economic well-being of Athas, as they neither create nor produce any raw materials or refined goods. They are, however, top draws at gladiatorial arenas, although they seldom benefit from their victories. Some captive b'rohg are too stupid to attempt to escape, while others die in their mad flight from the sorcerer-kings' cities. B'rohg are sometimes &ldquo;seduced&rdquo; into gladiatorial slavery by being tempted with sweetmeats, fresh cold water, and a variety of simple yet enticing &ldquo;luxuries&rdquo;. However, this seduction is the exception and not the rule, as most b'rohg are sought out and overcome by shear force of numbers before being taken into slavery. Few people have ever made lasting friends with a b'rohg. Due to their limited intelligence b.rohg seldom remember friend from foe for any length of time.</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Renegade B'rohg</b></p>  <p class=\"ni\">B'rohg that are taken to the gladiatorial games of the city states are never allowed to win their freedom. Despite their humanoid form, b'rohg are considered animals by their trainers and owners, suitable for nothing more than entertainment through savage combat. However, low intelligence does not equate to low cunning, and many b'rohg have escaped their bonds to live free again in the Athasian wilderness. However, once trained for so-called civilized combat, the b'rohg is no longer suited to his original lifestyle.</p><p>While in the arena, renegades learn a great deal about more sophisticated combat techniques. They learn the benefits and use of armor, something rarely practiced in the wild. Renegade b'rohg fashion their own armor when they reach the wilderness, using animal bone, chitin, and wood as available. A renegade b'rohg has AC 3, 4, or 5 (1d3+2).</p><p>Also, a renegade b'rohg usually escapes with a fair weapon from the arena. It is either metal (25%) or obsidian (75%), and the renegade is skilled enough to use it and some other primitive weapon (a club or spear) at the same time. Renegade b'rohg can attack with both weapons each round without attack roll penalties.</p><p>Renegade b'rohg tend to live solitary lives. In encounters with other, more primitive b'rohg, the renegade keeps his distance, ashamed of his original capture, but also ashamed by the simplistic lives of his kin. The only places where renegades find universal acceptance is among the slave tribes. Once again among the familiar trappings of gladiatorial companionship, but without the abuse of servitude, renegades make excellent warriors and laborers.</p><p>There is a 20% chance that any encounter with b'rohg will, in fact, be with a single renegade b'rohg.</p><p></p><br clear=\"all\" style=\"clear:both; height:0;\">\r\n","images":["<img src=\"grf/ds.gif\" width=\"150\" height=\"75\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Dark Sun\" title=\"Dark Sun\" align=\"right\">","<img src=\"img/brohg.gif\" alt=\"B'rohg\" title=\"B'rohg\" border=\"0\" width=\"300\" height=\"360\" style=\"text-align:right;\" align=\"right\">","<img src=\"grf/add2_01.gif\" width=\"200\" height=\"56\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Advanced Dungeons & Dragons 2nd Edition\">"],"setting":"Dark Sun","statblock":{"B'rohg":{"Activity Cycle":"Any","Alignment":"Neutral","Armor Class":"7 (10)","Climate/Terrain":"Any","Damage/Attack":"11-18 (1d8+10)","Diet":"Omnivore","Frequency":"Common","Hit Dice":"5+3","Intelligence":"Low (5-7)","Magic Resistance":"See below","Morale":"Average (10)","Movement":"15","No. Appearing":"1-12","No. of Attacks":"4","Organization":"Bands or cliques","Size":"H (15' tall)","Special Attacks":"See below","Special Defenses":"See below","THAC0":"15","Treasure":"J,K","XP Value":"650<br>Leader: 975<br>Renegade: 975"}},"title":"B'rohg"},"sources":["2405"],"statblock_names":[],"title":"B'rohg","prev_key":"breiryn","next_key":"brokenon","monster_path":"/appendix/brohg"}},"staticQueryHashes":[],"slicesMap":{}}
