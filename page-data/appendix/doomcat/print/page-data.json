While the powers listed above are the most common, some aarakocra have different or additional powers.</p><p class=\"f\">A race of intelligent, birdlike creatures living in the deepest deserts of Athas, the rare Athasian <a href=\"/appendix/aarakocr\">aarakocra</a> spends its time soaring on thermals in search of food.</p><p>The aarakocra is 7 to 8 feet tall with a wingspan of 20 feet or more. Because of its large wingspan, an aarakocra can carry as much as 75% of its own body weight and still fly easily. An aarakocra can fly a short distance carrying a burden equaling 125% of its own body weight. The average body weight of a full grown male is 100 pounds and a female is 85 pounds.</p><p>Each wing has a &ldquo;hand&rdquo; at its midpoint, consisting of three fingers and an opposable thumb. The fourth finger forms the rigid leading edge of the wing. In flight the hands cannot be used, but on the ground the aarakocra can use its hands almost as a human would. The aarakocra's body is protected by a thin bony plate on the chest, much like a solid rib cage. Talons on its legs can be used as claws and can be retracted to reveal a second set of hands, also with three fingers and an opposable thumb. Except for the chest plate, the entire skeleton is hollow and extremely fragile.</p><p>From a distance, the Athasian aarakocra resembles a huge <a href=\"/appendix/bird\">vulture</a>. Its black eyes, set in the front of the head, provide excellent vision over a long range. The plumage is generally black with a white collar for adult males and black or brown with a smaller white collar for females. Adolescents are a mixture of brown and black. The beak is large and covers most of the head. Plumage begins at the crown of the head and is darker near the head, except for the collar. Athasian aarakocra speak their own language and the languages of vultures and other large birds. Some speak the common tongue (5% to 10% chance depending on how deep in the wastelands a tribe lives).</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Combat:</b> Aarakocra can fight in the air or on the ground. They prefer aerial combat since their bones are too fragile to withstand a solid blow from a human-sized opponent. In combat against creatures on the ground, they prefer to fly over their victim and drop weighted nets. Some aarakocra use darts to harass ground-based opponents.</p><p>If their opponents can fly, the aarakocra generally forgo the use of the net, although large groups sometimes use nets on flying creatures. Normally, aarakocra attack flying creatures with long spears, diving from above and allowing the momentum to carry the spear through the target. Such an attack doubles the damage if the aarakocra have been able to dive at least 50 feet. Only the very largest aarakocra can carry more than one of these spears, they can attack with both at once with no penalty, causing double damage on each strike. All diving attacks are made at +4 and should be treated as a charge attack. All other penalties and restrictions of charge attacks apply.</p><p>The effect of the aarakocra's nets depends on if the opponent is flying at the time it becomes entangled. Creatures on the ground that are hit by a net are entangled and unable to participate in any combat until they make a successful Strength check to get free of the net. Flying creatures hit by a net can no longer fly and immediately begin falling. If they cannot escape the net or use some magical means to arrest the fall, normal falling damage applies.</p><p>Unless victims are entangled in nets, aarakocra are cautious in ground combat. If the aarakocra outnumber their opponents they advance in a straight line and thrust with their spears. If outnumbered, or the opponents are particularly tough, the aarakocra withdraw. Victims entangled in nets are killed or incapacitated for use as food or ransom.</p><p>Athasian aarakocra are mindful of their physical limitations as well as their comparatively low psionic abilities. They do not normally initiate psionic combat. At the first sign of psionic powers from any of their victims, however, all aarakocra that have some ability will use whatever attack and defense modes they can in an attempt to destroy the threat. Large groups of is or more aarakocra may initiate psionic combat if their leaders feel they can win quickly and avoid physical combat.</p><p>In desperation, an aarakocra can attempt to bite an opponent in combat. Because of the unwieldiness of its beak, the aarakocra has a THAC0 of 18 if attacking with this appendage. Further, the birdman causes only 1d2 points of damage with the beak.</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Habitat/Society:</b> Athasian aarakocra live in tribes with 6-20 (2d8+4) members, depending on the prestige of the leader. The largest tribe ever recorded had 50 members. The tribal hunting territory depends on the size of the tribe, usually about 500 square miles for a tribe of 10 members. There are no rigid boundaries between tribes and border disputes are not uncommon.</p><p>Alignments of tribe members are similar to the alignment of the leader. A tribe that has a leader who is neutral good may have neutral good, chaotic good, lawful good, and true neutral members. A predominantly evil tribe does not recognize boundaries with other tribes and treats other tribes as inferior beings to be eliminated.</p><p>Athasian aarakocra aren't happy in enclosed spaces, but they they take refuge in a cave or building if necessary.</p><p>Nonevil tribes live in rocky aeries in the highest peaks they can find. Evil tribes are normally nomadic and use an aerie made by another tribe if they need to remain in an area for a long time, even if they have to evict the tribe that made the nest.</p><p>Aarakocra aren't friendly toward intruders in their territory, especially caravans. They try to extract a toll from the caravan for passage through the desert. Good-aligned tribes allow unhindered passage of caravans that pay a tribute. If someone refuses to pay the tribute, the aarakocra try to capture scouts or outriders from the party and hold them until an even larger tribute is paid. The payment may be either livestock or shiny objects. Aarakocra are smart enough not to be taken in by glass baubles instead of gems, although they cannot tell the difference between the more common gems and the rare ones.</p><p>Evil tribes ask for tribute and often attack a caravan whether it pays or not. Aarakocra always demand shiny objects such as stones. These tribes find humans and demihumans to be quite tasty and prefer them to other food.</p><p>Good-aligned tribes of aarakocra sometimes return a lost traveler to the edge of the desert after first removing any valuables the traveler may be carrying. On very rare occasions a tribe might return a lost group of travelers to the more frequently traveled parts of the desert, again after first taking any valuables as payment.</p><p>The oldest male is the leader of the tribal hunting party and has 4+4 Hit Dice. The oldest female is in charge of the tribal aerie and has 3+3 HD. In tribes that have more than 15 members, the next oldest aarakocra serves as shaman and has 3+3 HD; the shaman completes the triumvirate necessary for proper worship and the summoning of elementals. (Interestingly, no magic-using aarakocra has ever been recorded.) Tribes without a shaman cannot summon <a href=\"/appendix/element1\">air elementals</a>, which is an important part of aarakocra culture.</p><p>The shaman is the leader of the daily sun worship. Aarakocra worship the sun because it provides them with the thermals they need to soar in search of food. The shaman also leads the mystic rituals used to summon an air elemental. Summoning an air elemental is usually done only in preparation for the tribe's most sacred ceremony, the hunt. Small tribes must band together for this ceremony to allow the triumvirate to be formed.</p><p>The ceremony to summon an air elemental must be conducted at dawn and requires the oldest male and female to emit a highpitched keening whistle. The shaman conducts an intricate dance around them, simultaneously chanting an ancient summoning mantra.</p><p>The hunt is the final part of the initiation of adolescent aarakocra to adulthood and often takes the tribe far from their normal teritory. The target is always a <a href=\"/appendix/drakalsi\">silt drake</a>. The hunt is the only time the females leave the relative safety of the nest. Even an evil tribe will not interfere with a tribe on a hunt. An air elemental is often summoned to help find the drake, but never takes part in the actual combat. Although the adult members of the tribe take part in the initial phases of the combat, it is the initiates who deliver the final, killing blows to me drake. Scars from the hunt are considered a mark of pride among all aarakocra.</p><p>The females spend about eight months of the year incubating their eggs. Athasian aarakocra mate for life and a pair normally produces as many as 10 offspring. A female lays one egg a year. Constant incubation is not required because of the high daytime temperatures, so the females can maintain the nest and keep the tribe's treasure in order.</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Ecology:</b> Athasian aarakocra are high on the food chain and have no natural enemies other than <a href=\"/appendix/drakatha\">drakes</a>. Unless evil, aarakocra leave their own territory only to hunt the silt drake and return as soon as possible when the hunt is over. (Evil aarakocra attack others, as noted above.) Aarakocra eggs and hatchlings are sought after by wealthy land owners who wish to use the creatures as scouts and sentries. An egg can bring as much as 10 cp in Tyr's marketplace. Tribes that have had eggs or hatchlings stolen have long memories and sometimes take revenge against the thief at a later date. Captive aarakocra join any tribe they come in contact with.</p><p>Athasian aarakocra have a natural life span of 21-30 years.</p><br clear=\"all\" style=\"clear:both; height:0;\">\r\n","images":["<img src=\"grf/ds.gif\" width=\"150\" height=\"75\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Dark Sun\" title=\"Dark Sun\" align=\"right\">","<img src=\"img/aarakath.gif\" alt=\"Aarakocra (Athas)\" title=\"Aarakocra (Athas)\" border=\"0\" width=\"300\" height=\"360\" style=\"text-align:right;\" align=\"right\">","<img src=\"grf/add2_01.gif\" width=\"200\" height=\"56\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Advanced Dungeons & Dragons 2nd Edition\">"],"setting":"Dark Sun","statblock":{"Aarakocra (Athas)":{"Activity Cycle":"Day","Alignment":"Any","Armor Class":"7","Climate/Terrain":"Deep desert","Damage/Attack":"1d3/1d3 or by weapon","Diet":"Carnivore","Frequency":"Rare","Hit Dice":"2+2","Intelligence":"Average (8-10)","Magic Resistance":"Nil","Morale":"Steady (11)","Movement":"6, Fl 36 (C)","No. Appearing":"1d10","No. of Attacks":"2","Organization":"Tribal","Size":"M (20'+ wingspan)","Special Attacks":"Nil","Special Defenses":"Nil","THAC0":"17","Treasure":"Varies","XP Value":"65"}},"title":"Aarakocra (Athas)"},"sources":["2433"],"statblock_names":[],"title":"Aarakocra (Athas)","prev_key":"zygraat","next_key":"aarakocr","monster_path":"/appendix/aarakath"}}},"pageContext":{"monster_key":"doomcat","monster_data":{"TSR":["TheLonesomeRoad"],"fullBody":"  <table cellspacing=\"0\" cellpadding=\"0\"><tr><th>Climate/Terrain:</th><td>Populated areas</td></tr><tr><th>Frequency:</th><td>Very rare</td></tr><tr><th>Organization:</th><td>Solitary</td></tr><tr><th>Activity Cycle:</th><td>Night</td></tr><tr><th>Diet:</th><td>Carnivore</td></tr><tr><th>Intelligence:</th><td>Exceptional (15-16)</td></tr><tr><th>Treasure:</th><td>Nil</td></tr><tr><th>Alignment:</th><td>Chaotic evil</td></tr><tr><th>No. Appearing:</th><td>1</td></tr><tr><th>Armor Class:</th><td>5</td></tr><tr><th>Movement:</th><td>18</td></tr><tr><th>Hit Dice:</th><td>1+2</td></tr><tr><th>THAC0:</th><td>19</td></tr><tr><th>No. of Attacks:</th><td>2</td></tr><tr><th>Damage/Attack:</th><td>1/1d2</td></tr><tr><th>Special Attacks:</th><td>Rake, Spells</td></tr><tr><th>Special Defenses:</th><td>Invisibility</td></tr><tr><th>Magic Resistance:</th><td>20%</td></tr><tr><th>Size:</th><td>T</td></tr><tr><th>Morale:</th><td>Unsteady (5)</td></tr><tr><th>XP Value:</th><td>975</td></tr></table><p class=\"f\"><i>The day the cat spoke to me, I thought I was mad. Now I know that if I am mad, it's because I listened to its lies.</i></p><p><i>Laura Graibley</i></p><p><br>A doomcat is a manipulative little creature with potent powers at its disposal. It forces itself into households and demands favors with the threat of dire prophecies. When displeased, it can unleash a terrible retribtution.</p><p>Doomcats appear perfectly benign. They look like ordinary�if worse-for-wear�<a href=\"/appendix/catsmall\">housecats</a>. They come in a variety of breeds and colors, but are usully quite ugly as domestic felines go. Their ears are ragged and their fur is patchy and flea-ridden. Often, a doomcat will have a deformity of some kind, such as a missing tail or leg. Their eyes, however, are always clear and bright, and usually two different colors.</p><p>Doomcats do not appear to speak�at first. When conversing with their &ldquo;owners&rdquo;, they communicate in an appropriate language. It is not known if they can read as well.</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Combat:</b> Superficially, doomcats have little ability to protect themselves. Indeed, their combat statistics are similar to a normal housecat's. They may bite for 1 point of damage, and scratch with both front claws for 1-2 points of damage combined. If its front claws hit, a doomcat may rake with is rear claws for an additional 1-2 damage. They are slightly quicker and more agile than a typical cat, as reflected in their Armor Class. A doomcat can also become invisible at will.</p><p>The true power of a doomcat lies in its terrifying spell-like abilities. The creature rarely uses these powers, as they cannot be used often, and have the possibility of harming the doomcat itself. Nevertheless, if the creature's invisibility has failed to protect it, and it feels threatened, it will resort to these abilities. A doomcat may use the following priest spells as if it were a 16th-level priest: <i>animal summoning III</i>, <i>cause blindness or deafness</i>, <i>cause disease</i>, <i>confusion</i>, <i>control weather</i>, <i>control winds</i>, <i>earthquake</i>, <i>insect plague</i>, <i>transmute water to dust</i>, <i>weather summoning</i>. The doomcat may use spells with a range of &ldquo;touch&rdquo; at a range of 5 yards. A doomcat may not use more than three spells per day.</p><p>Doomcats are notoriously cowardly. They will only fight as a last resort. Doomcats know that they are relatively weak creatures, without much going for them other than their cunning and a handful of supernatural abilities. If the disposition in a particular town becomes too aggressive, they will leave, usually unleashing a spectacular cataclysm on the doomed hamlet out of sheer spite as they depart.</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Habitat/Society:</b> Doomcats wander from town to town, adopting themselves into households. It is not known how they are created, but it is often speculated that a doomcat may be a witch somehow trapped in the form of a cat. Conversely, there is a theory that doomcats are normal cats which lived near evil religious sites, and somehow acquired their remarkable abilities through long-term exposure to unholy energies.</p><p>A doomcat is an incredibly selfish creature. It sees humans as idiots to be manipulated into giving the doomcat anything it wants. The doomcat accomplishes this through an elaborate scheme that normally takes a very typical pattern. The doomcat singles out a family, usually with an animal-lover among its members - children do nicely. Before revealing itself, the doomcat uses its spell abilities to inflict some calamity on the household, such as a disease or spurt of foul weather. After a time, the creature approaches the family as a normal housecat. It plays up the part of the affectionate stray, showering its newfound &ldquo;owners&rdquo; with leg-rubbing, purring, and hungry mewling. Inevitably, the doomcat is taken in by the unsuspecting family. The doomcat allows itself to be pampered for a time, before revealing its &ldquo;secret&rdquo;.</p><p>Eventually, the doomcat begins speaking to the most mentally unstable member of the family. It tells this individual that it has the power to prevent more horrible calamities from befalling the family, if only they can provide it with a meal or two of fine fish, and perhaps a soft bed. The doomcat is purposely vague about how it could possibly have such power, usually referring to some connection between felines and good fortune. Though astonished, the individual will usually comply, fearful as they are of further misfortune. After all, the poor cat doesn't ask for much in return, does he?The situation rapidly sprials out of control for the unfortunate victim, however. The doomcat begins asking for more and more luxuries, and eventually becomes the most well-off individual in the household. The creature's attitude quickly changes from that of a benificent savior to a demanding brat. Eventually, the relationship decays into one of sheer blackmail, with the doomcat holding disaster over the heads of its &ldquo;owner&rdquo;. If the family becomes suspicious, the doomcat may give a moderate display of power, just to reestablish who is in control. In most cases, the &ldquo;owners&rdquo; will eventually have had enough of the doomcat, and attempt to harm the monster physically. The doomcat will then usually move on to another unsuspecting owner, unleashing some final horror as it flees.</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Ecology:</b> Doomcats have a carnivorous diet, like other domestic cats, and will eat just about anything if hungry enough. However, they are spoiled creatures with a taste for luxury, and will go to great lengths to procure finer food.</p><p>Doomcats often wreak a great deal of havoc on their surrounding. A village can be taxed of all its resources, as family after family falls for the doomcat's ruse. Eventually, a mob complete with torches and pitchforks may come looking to kill the &ldquo;devil-cat&rdquo; in their midst. Tales speak of one such village in Arkandale, where the entire town was swallowed up by an earthquake in mere moments.</p><p><br></p><p class=\"ni\"><a href=\"http://webspace.webring.com/people/du/um_8226/monsters//appendix/doomcat\">The Lonesome Road</a></p><br clear=\"all\" style=\"clear:both; height:0;\">\r\n","images":["<img src=\"grf/rv.gif\" width=\"150\" height=\"75\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Ravenloft\" title=\"Ravenloft\" align=\"right\">","<img src=\"grf/add2_01.gif\" width=\"200\" height=\"56\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Advanced Dungeons & Dragons 2nd Edition\">"],"setting":"Ravenloft","statblock":{"Doomcat":{"Activity Cycle":"Night","Alignment":"Chaotic evil","Armor Class":"5","Climate/Terrain":"Populated areas","Damage/Attack":"1/1d2","Diet":"Carnivore","Frequency":"Very rare","Hit Dice":"1+2","Intelligence":"Exceptional (15-16)","Magic Resistance":"20%","Morale":"Unsteady (5)","Movement":"18","No. Appearing":"1","No. of Attacks":"2","Organization":"Solitary","Size":"T","Special Attacks":"Rake, Spells","Special Defenses":"Invisibility","THAC0":"19","Treasure":"Nil","XP Value":"975"}},"title":"Doomcat"},"sources":["TheLonesomeRoad"],"statblock_names":[],"title":"Doomcat","prev_key":"dolphina","next_key":"doomguar","monster_path":"/appendix/doomcat"}},"staticQueryHashes":[],"slicesMap":{}}
