While the powers listed above are the most common, some aarakocra have different or additional powers.</p><p class=\"f\">A race of intelligent, birdlike creatures living in the deepest deserts of Athas, the rare Athasian <a href=\"/appendix/aarakocr\">aarakocra</a> spends its time soaring on thermals in search of food.</p><p>The aarakocra is 7 to 8 feet tall with a wingspan of 20 feet or more. Because of its large wingspan, an aarakocra can carry as much as 75% of its own body weight and still fly easily. An aarakocra can fly a short distance carrying a burden equaling 125% of its own body weight. The average body weight of a full grown male is 100 pounds and a female is 85 pounds.</p><p>Each wing has a &ldquo;hand&rdquo; at its midpoint, consisting of three fingers and an opposable thumb. The fourth finger forms the rigid leading edge of the wing. In flight the hands cannot be used, but on the ground the aarakocra can use its hands almost as a human would. The aarakocra's body is protected by a thin bony plate on the chest, much like a solid rib cage. Talons on its legs can be used as claws and can be retracted to reveal a second set of hands, also with three fingers and an opposable thumb. Except for the chest plate, the entire skeleton is hollow and extremely fragile.</p><p>From a distance, the Athasian aarakocra resembles a huge <a href=\"/appendix/bird\">vulture</a>. Its black eyes, set in the front of the head, provide excellent vision over a long range. The plumage is generally black with a white collar for adult males and black or brown with a smaller white collar for females. Adolescents are a mixture of brown and black. The beak is large and covers most of the head. Plumage begins at the crown of the head and is darker near the head, except for the collar. Athasian aarakocra speak their own language and the languages of vultures and other large birds. Some speak the common tongue (5% to 10% chance depending on how deep in the wastelands a tribe lives).</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Combat:</b> Aarakocra can fight in the air or on the ground. They prefer aerial combat since their bones are too fragile to withstand a solid blow from a human-sized opponent. In combat against creatures on the ground, they prefer to fly over their victim and drop weighted nets. Some aarakocra use darts to harass ground-based opponents.</p><p>If their opponents can fly, the aarakocra generally forgo the use of the net, although large groups sometimes use nets on flying creatures. Normally, aarakocra attack flying creatures with long spears, diving from above and allowing the momentum to carry the spear through the target. Such an attack doubles the damage if the aarakocra have been able to dive at least 50 feet. Only the very largest aarakocra can carry more than one of these spears, they can attack with both at once with no penalty, causing double damage on each strike. All diving attacks are made at +4 and should be treated as a charge attack. All other penalties and restrictions of charge attacks apply.</p><p>The effect of the aarakocra's nets depends on if the opponent is flying at the time it becomes entangled. Creatures on the ground that are hit by a net are entangled and unable to participate in any combat until they make a successful Strength check to get free of the net. Flying creatures hit by a net can no longer fly and immediately begin falling. If they cannot escape the net or use some magical means to arrest the fall, normal falling damage applies.</p><p>Unless victims are entangled in nets, aarakocra are cautious in ground combat. If the aarakocra outnumber their opponents they advance in a straight line and thrust with their spears. If outnumbered, or the opponents are particularly tough, the aarakocra withdraw. Victims entangled in nets are killed or incapacitated for use as food or ransom.</p><p>Athasian aarakocra are mindful of their physical limitations as well as their comparatively low psionic abilities. They do not normally initiate psionic combat. At the first sign of psionic powers from any of their victims, however, all aarakocra that have some ability will use whatever attack and defense modes they can in an attempt to destroy the threat. Large groups of is or more aarakocra may initiate psionic combat if their leaders feel they can win quickly and avoid physical combat.</p><p>In desperation, an aarakocra can attempt to bite an opponent in combat. Because of the unwieldiness of its beak, the aarakocra has a THAC0 of 18 if attacking with this appendage. Further, the birdman causes only 1d2 points of damage with the beak.</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Habitat/Society:</b> Athasian aarakocra live in tribes with 6-20 (2d8+4) members, depending on the prestige of the leader. The largest tribe ever recorded had 50 members. The tribal hunting territory depends on the size of the tribe, usually about 500 square miles for a tribe of 10 members. There are no rigid boundaries between tribes and border disputes are not uncommon.</p><p>Alignments of tribe members are similar to the alignment of the leader. A tribe that has a leader who is neutral good may have neutral good, chaotic good, lawful good, and true neutral members. A predominantly evil tribe does not recognize boundaries with other tribes and treats other tribes as inferior beings to be eliminated.</p><p>Athasian aarakocra aren't happy in enclosed spaces, but they they take refuge in a cave or building if necessary.</p><p>Nonevil tribes live in rocky aeries in the highest peaks they can find. Evil tribes are normally nomadic and use an aerie made by another tribe if they need to remain in an area for a long time, even if they have to evict the tribe that made the nest.</p><p>Aarakocra aren't friendly toward intruders in their territory, especially caravans. They try to extract a toll from the caravan for passage through the desert. Good-aligned tribes allow unhindered passage of caravans that pay a tribute. If someone refuses to pay the tribute, the aarakocra try to capture scouts or outriders from the party and hold them until an even larger tribute is paid. The payment may be either livestock or shiny objects. Aarakocra are smart enough not to be taken in by glass baubles instead of gems, although they cannot tell the difference between the more common gems and the rare ones.</p><p>Evil tribes ask for tribute and often attack a caravan whether it pays or not. Aarakocra always demand shiny objects such as stones. These tribes find humans and demihumans to be quite tasty and prefer them to other food.</p><p>Good-aligned tribes of aarakocra sometimes return a lost traveler to the edge of the desert after first removing any valuables the traveler may be carrying. On very rare occasions a tribe might return a lost group of travelers to the more frequently traveled parts of the desert, again after first taking any valuables as payment.</p><p>The oldest male is the leader of the tribal hunting party and has 4+4 Hit Dice. The oldest female is in charge of the tribal aerie and has 3+3 HD. In tribes that have more than 15 members, the next oldest aarakocra serves as shaman and has 3+3 HD; the shaman completes the triumvirate necessary for proper worship and the summoning of elementals. (Interestingly, no magic-using aarakocra has ever been recorded.) Tribes without a shaman cannot summon <a href=\"/appendix/element1\">air elementals</a>, which is an important part of aarakocra culture.</p><p>The shaman is the leader of the daily sun worship. Aarakocra worship the sun because it provides them with the thermals they need to soar in search of food. The shaman also leads the mystic rituals used to summon an air elemental. Summoning an air elemental is usually done only in preparation for the tribe's most sacred ceremony, the hunt. Small tribes must band together for this ceremony to allow the triumvirate to be formed.</p><p>The ceremony to summon an air elemental must be conducted at dawn and requires the oldest male and female to emit a highpitched keening whistle. The shaman conducts an intricate dance around them, simultaneously chanting an ancient summoning mantra.</p><p>The hunt is the final part of the initiation of adolescent aarakocra to adulthood and often takes the tribe far from their normal teritory. The target is always a <a href=\"/appendix/drakalsi\">silt drake</a>. The hunt is the only time the females leave the relative safety of the nest. Even an evil tribe will not interfere with a tribe on a hunt. An air elemental is often summoned to help find the drake, but never takes part in the actual combat. Although the adult members of the tribe take part in the initial phases of the combat, it is the initiates who deliver the final, killing blows to me drake. Scars from the hunt are considered a mark of pride among all aarakocra.</p><p>The females spend about eight months of the year incubating their eggs. Athasian aarakocra mate for life and a pair normally produces as many as 10 offspring. A female lays one egg a year. Constant incubation is not required because of the high daytime temperatures, so the females can maintain the nest and keep the tribe's treasure in order.</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Ecology:</b> Athasian aarakocra are high on the food chain and have no natural enemies other than <a href=\"/appendix/drakatha\">drakes</a>. Unless evil, aarakocra leave their own territory only to hunt the silt drake and return as soon as possible when the hunt is over. (Evil aarakocra attack others, as noted above.) Aarakocra eggs and hatchlings are sought after by wealthy land owners who wish to use the creatures as scouts and sentries. An egg can bring as much as 10 cp in Tyr's marketplace. Tribes that have had eggs or hatchlings stolen have long memories and sometimes take revenge against the thief at a later date. Captive aarakocra join any tribe they come in contact with.</p><p>Athasian aarakocra have a natural life span of 21-30 years.</p><br clear=\"all\" style=\"clear:both; height:0;\">\r\n","images":["<img src=\"grf/ds.gif\" width=\"150\" height=\"75\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Dark Sun\" title=\"Dark Sun\" align=\"right\">","<img src=\"img/aarakath.gif\" alt=\"Aarakocra (Athas)\" title=\"Aarakocra (Athas)\" border=\"0\" width=\"300\" height=\"360\" style=\"text-align:right;\" align=\"right\">","<img src=\"grf/add2_01.gif\" width=\"200\" height=\"56\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Advanced Dungeons & Dragons 2nd Edition\">"],"setting":"Dark Sun","statblock":{"Aarakocra (Athas)":{"Activity Cycle":"Day","Alignment":"Any","Armor Class":"7","Climate/Terrain":"Deep desert","Damage/Attack":"1d3/1d3 or by weapon","Diet":"Carnivore","Frequency":"Rare","Hit Dice":"2+2","Intelligence":"Average (8-10)","Magic Resistance":"Nil","Morale":"Steady (11)","Movement":"6, Fl 36 (C)","No. Appearing":"1d10","No. of Attacks":"2","Organization":"Tribal","Size":"M (20'+ wingspan)","Special Attacks":"Nil","Special Defenses":"Nil","THAC0":"17","Treasure":"Varies","XP Value":"65"}},"title":"Aarakocra (Athas)"},"sources":["2433"],"statblock_names":[],"title":"Aarakocra (Athas)","prev_key":"zygraat","next_key":"aarakocr","monster_path":"/appendix/aarakath"}}},"pageContext":{"monster_key":"witcmara","monster_data":{"TSR":["2119"],"fullBody":"  <table cellspacing=\"0\" cellpadding=\"0\"><tr class=\"bk\"><th> </th><th class=\"cn\">Primary</th><th class=\"cn\">Secondary</th><th class=\"cn\">Tertiary</th><th class=\"cn\">Space</th><th class=\"cn\">Remote</th></tr><tr><th>Climate/Terrain:</th><td>Any</td><td>Any</td><td>Any</td><td>Any</td><td>Wildspace</td></tr><tr><th>Frequency:</th><td>Very rare</td><td>Very rare</td><td>Very rare</td><td>Very rare</td><td>Very rare</td></tr><tr><th>Organization:</th><td>Solitary</td><td>Horde</td><td>Swarm</td><td>Solitary</td><td>Solitary</td></tr><tr><th>Activity Cycle:</th><td>Day</td><td>Night</td><td>Any</td><td>Any</td><td>Any</td></tr><tr><th>Diet:</th><td>Omnivore</td><td>Omnivore</td><td>Omnivore</td><td>Omnivore</td><td>Omnivore</td></tr><tr><th>Intelligence:</th><td>Low (5-7)</td><td>Low (5-7)</td><td>Semi- (2-4)</td><td>Average (8-10)</td><td>Non- (0)</td></tr><tr><th>Treasure:</th><td>Nil</td><td>Nil</td><td>Nil</td><td>Nil</td><td>Nil</td></tr><tr><th>Alignment:</th><td>Chaotic evil</td><td>Chaotic evil</td><td>Neutral evil</td><td>Chaotic neutral</td><td>Neutral</td></tr><tr><th>No. Appearing:</th><td>1-3</td><td>2-20*</td><td>1-4*</td><td>1</td><td>1-5</td></tr><tr><th>Armor Class:</th><td>-5</td><td>0</td><td>2</td><td>-3</td><td>5</td></tr><tr><th>Movement:</th><td>9</td><td>48</td><td>16</td><td>SR 3</td><td>24</td></tr><tr><th>Hit Dice:</th><td>15</td><td>8</td><td>4</td><td>45</td><td>7</td></tr><tr><th>THAC0:</th><td>5</td><td>13</td><td>17</td><td>5</td><td>13</td></tr><tr><th>No. of Attacks:</th><td>7</td><td>6, spit</td><td>3</td><td>7, sunbeam</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><th>Damage/Attack:</th><td>3d6 (&times;6)/5d12</td><td>2d6 (&times;6)/3d6/2d10</td><td>1d6+3 (&times;2)/1d10</td><td>1d6 hull pts (&times;6)/2d6 hull pts/25d10</td><td>See below</td></tr><tr><th>Special Attacks:</th><td>See below</td><td>See below</td><td>See below</td><td>See below</td><td>See below</td></tr><tr><th>Special Defenses:</th><td>See below</td><td>See below</td><td>See below</td><td>See below</td><td>See below</td></tr><tr><th>Magic Resistance:</th><td>Nil</td><td>Nil</td><td>Nil</td><td>Nil</td><td>Nil</td></tr><tr><th>Size:</th><td>G (200')</td><td>H (20')</td><td>M (5-6')</td><td>G (1000')</td><td>G (25')</td></tr><tr><th>Morale:</th><td>Fearless (19-20)</td><td>Elite (13-14)</td><td>Steady (11-12)</td><td>Fearless (19-20)</td><td>Steady (11-12)</td></tr><tr><th>XP Value:</th><td>12,000</td><td>6,000</td><td>270</td><td>40,000</td><td>2,000</td></tr></table>\r\n<p class=\"f\">* indicates per number of previous monster; i.e., one primary can hatch 2d10 secondaries; two secondaries can hatch 2-8 tertiaries (1d4 each).</p>  <p class=\"f\"><a href=\"/appendix/orc\">Orc</a> shamans created the witchlight marauders during the escalation of the Unhuman Wars to &ldquo;counter ruthless <a href=\"/appendix/elf\">elf</a> aggression&rdquo;, as one surviving orc scroll reads. In truth, the marauders were shock troops, organic first-strike weapons meant to devastate whole elven planets. Their efficiency as killing machines was matched only by their fast breeding.</p><p>Luckily for the rest of humanoid civilization, these monsters were wiped out during the Unhuman Wars. There are orcish legends, however, of <i>timestop</i> devices that preserved some of these beasts as doomsday weapons.</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Combat:</b> The slug-like land marauders were enormous (500+ feet), dwarfing even venerable <a href=\"/appendix/dragon\">red dragons</a>. Everything in the witchlight marauder's path - plants, animals, city walls, mountains - was food for the beast's cavernous central maw. Secondary mouths sprouted to gobble up prey on either side of the beast's path. Land marauders especially liked metal, mineral deposits, and magical items. All food made its way to the blast-furnace gut, producing poison gas - and more witchlight marauders.</p><p>As the marauder gorged itself, it periodically ejected secondary marauders. These smaller (20' tall) killers leapt forth, rending and killing with six poisonous metallic talons (2d6 each; save vs. poison or take 1d10 additional damage), steel teeth (3d6), and a sweeping spiked tail (2d10). The secondaries also spat an acid jet (1d8 per round, 30' range), and could climb nearly any surface with their gripping feet. These monsters ranged the countryside, covering miles in a single night, homing in on the scent of elven blood, destroying all survivors of the primaries' attack.</p><p>Once the secondaries gorged themselves on living flesh, they ejected still smaller fighters. These small (4' tall) tertiaries were berserker warriors with two metallic sword blades in place of hands. Their strength (18/50, +3 damage) and agility made them fearsome in combat.</p><p>After a week's &ldquo;foraging&rdquo;, the primary marauder burrowed deep underground and established a lair. In the two weeks that followed, guarded by secondaries, the primary split like an amoeba into two primary marauders. The cycle continued until the marauders ran out of food, whereupon they turned on and destroyed each other.</p><p>These land marauders reached their targets via still larger creatures: the space marauders. These enormous (1,000') reptilian horrors traveled through wildspace on sails spun from special organs on their bodies. These sails doubled as focusing mirrors, enabling the space beast to focus a deadly (25d10) sunbeam on targets. Once they reached a crystal sphere, they phased their way in, searching for small celestial bodies to feed on. Like their smaller kin, flying marauders ate any being, rock, or small moon they found, creating both land marauders and explosive projectiles (12d6 hull points of damage).</p><p>The spacegoing marauders were enormous (1,000'). A crocodilian head sported a nest of thousands of yard-long, razor-sharp teeth. This head was encrusted with glowing red eyes, and bit for 2-12 hull points of damage. Surrounding the central head were six long, flexible necks ending in eyeless heads with gaping, shipsmashing maws (1-6 hull pts damage per head). The scaly, veined necks were attached to a tree-trunk shaped body that terminated in a pulsating mass of writhing hawser-like tentacles. At the center of this squirming mass were the umbilicals to which were attached three primary marauders. As individual primaries reached maturity and detached, new ones grew in their places.</p><p>The space marauder's crocodilian mouth held thousands of yard-long, razor-sharp teeth (2d6 hull points). Surrounding the many-eyed central head were six long, flexible necks ending in eyeless heads with gaping mouths (1d6 hull points per head). The scaly necks attached to a tree trunk-shaped body that terminated in a mass of writhing hawser-like tentacles. At the center of this squirming mass, umbilicals held three primary marauders. As individual primaries reached maturity and detached, new ones grew in their places.</p><p>In addition to the land marauders, the spacers could also birth 1d4+1 remote feeders. These were little more than gigantic (550' diameter) flying gullets that would engulf matter from planets, digest it, and return to the mother beast to provide it with additional nourishment.</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Habitat/Society:</b> These solitary war beasts were bred and unleashed by orcish mages for use in the Unhuman Wars. The orcs' overall objective was a scorched-earth strategy that would leave the elven worlds lifeless, barren rocks.</p><p>Fortunately, the elven forces found out about the plan before the witchlight marauders were unleashed. Using their own new weapons (see the &ldquo;<a href=\"/appendix/bionoid\">Bionoid</a>&rdquo; and &ldquo;<a href=\"/appendix/spirwarr\">Spirit Warrior</a>&rdquo; entries), they attacked and destroyed the orcs.</p><p>Some old scrolls hint that one of the space marauders escaped the elves' onslaught, burning its way through the elven blockade into space. Elven sages refuse to comment on this, dismissing the writings as orcish propaganda.</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Ecology:</b> During the Unhuman Wars, orcish breeders developed creatures that were meant to counter the threat of elven spirit warriors. These monsters served as land and air/space attackers. It was thought that the elves eradicated all of these doomsday weapons, but apparently a few may have survived either by encapsulation in time-stop fields or by wandering the starlanes. If an adventuring party were to find one of these organic timebombs, it would behoove them to leave the area immediately.</p><br clear=\"all\" style=\"clear:both; height:0;\">\r\n","images":["<img src=\"grf/sj.gif\" width=\"150\" height=\"75\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Spelljammer\" title=\"Spelljammer\" align=\"right\">","<img src=\"grf/add2_01.gif\" width=\"200\" height=\"56\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Advanced Dungeons & Dragons 2nd Edition\">"],"setting":"Spelljammer","statblock":{"Primary":{"Activity Cycle":"Day","Alignment":"Chaotic evil","Armor Class":"-5","Climate/Terrain":"Any","Damage/Attack":"3d6 (&times;6)/5d12","Diet":"Omnivore","Frequency":"Very rare","Hit Dice":"15","Intelligence":"Low (5-7)","Magic Resistance":"Nil","Morale":"Fearless (19-20)","Movement":"9","No. Appearing":"1-3","No. of Attacks":"7","Organization":"Solitary","Size":"G (200')","Special Attacks":"See below","Special Defenses":"See below","THAC0":"5","Treasure":"Nil","XP Value":"12,000"},"Remote":{"Activity Cycle":"Any","Alignment":"Neutral","Armor Class":"5","Climate/Terrain":"Wildspace","Damage/Attack":"See below","Diet":"Omnivore","Frequency":"Very rare","Hit Dice":"7","Intelligence":"Non- (0)","Magic Resistance":"Nil","Morale":"Steady (11-12)","Movement":"24","No. Appearing":"1-5","No. of Attacks":"1","Organization":"Solitary","Size":"G (25')","Special Attacks":"See below","Special Defenses":"See below","THAC0":"13","Treasure":"Nil","XP Value":"2,000"},"Secondary":{"Activity Cycle":"Night","Alignment":"Chaotic evil","Armor Class":"0","Climate/Terrain":"Any","Damage/Attack":"2d6 (&times;6)/3d6/2d10","Diet":"Omnivore","Frequency":"Very rare","Hit Dice":"8","Intelligence":"Low (5-7)","Magic Resistance":"Nil","Morale":"Elite (13-14)","Movement":"48","No. Appearing":"2-20*","No. of Attacks":"6, spit","Organization":"Horde","Size":"H (20')","Special Attacks":"See below","Special Defenses":"See below","THAC0":"13","Treasure":"Nil","XP Value":"6,000"},"Space":{"Activity Cycle":"Any","Alignment":"Chaotic neutral","Armor Class":"-3","Climate/Terrain":"Any","Damage/Attack":"1d6 hull pts (&times;6)/2d6 hull pts/25d10","Diet":"Omnivore","Frequency":"Very rare","Hit Dice":"45","Intelligence":"Average (8-10)","Magic Resistance":"Nil","Morale":"Fearless (19-20)","Movement":"SR 3","No. Appearing":"1","No. of Attacks":"7, sunbeam","Organization":"Solitary","Size":"G (1000')","Special Attacks":"See below","Special Defenses":"See below","THAC0":"5","Treasure":"Nil","XP Value":"40,000"},"Tertiary":{"Activity Cycle":"Any","Alignment":"Neutral evil","Armor Class":"2","Climate/Terrain":"Any","Damage/Attack":"1d6+3 (&times;2)/1d10","Diet":"Omnivore","Frequency":"Very rare","Hit Dice":"4","Intelligence":"Semi- (2-4)","Magic Resistance":"Nil","Morale":"Steady (11-12)","Movement":"16","No. Appearing":"1-4*","No. of Attacks":"3","Organization":"Swarm","Size":"M (5-6')","Special Attacks":"See below","Special Defenses":"See below","THAC0":"17","Treasure":"Nil","XP Value":"270"}},"title":"Witchlight Marauder"},"sources":["2119"],"statblock_names":[],"title":"Witchlight Marauder","prev_key":"wintwigh","next_key":"wizshade","monster_path":"/appendix/witcmara"}},"staticQueryHashes":[],"slicesMap":{}}
