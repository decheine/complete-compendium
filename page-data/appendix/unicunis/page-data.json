A single such creature is called a unisus.</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Combat:</b> Unisi attack in a manner similar to unicorns. In a dive, a unisus does damage in a manner similar to a unicorn's charge, but it needs only 15' of space to launch the charge, as it relies on its falling momentum for the impact and can also propel itself forward with its wings if running. In such a dive, it can also use its hooves to attack at the same time. All these attacks are at +2 on the attack roll above all other bonuses (including the +2 for the horn), and the hoof attacks do double damage.</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Habitat/Society:</b> Unisi are identical in habitat and society to pegasi. Unisi may be ridden by maidens of any race who are pure at heart.</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Ecology:</b> Unisi are identical in ecology to pegasi. A unisi's horn can be used to brew <i>potions of flying</i>.</p><br clear=\"all\" style=\"clear:both; height:0;\">\r\n","images":["<img src=\"grf/dr.gif\" width=\"150\" height=\"75\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Dragon Magazine\" title=\"Dragon Magazine\" align=\"right\">","<img src=\"grf/add2_01.gif\" width=\"200\" height=\"56\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Advanced Dungeons & Dragons 2nd Edition\">"],"setting":"Dragon Magazine","statblock":{"Unicorn, Unisus":{"Activity Cycle":"Day","Alignment":"Chaotic good","Armor Class":"3","Climate/Terrain":"Temperate/Mountains","Damage/Attack":"1-6/1-6/1-12","Diet":"Herbivore","Frequency":"Very rare","Hit Dice":"4+4","Intelligence":"Average (8-10)","Magic Resistance":"Nil","Morale":"Steady (11-12)","Movement":"24, Fl 48 (B)","No. Appearing":"1-10","No. of Attacks":"3","Organization":"Herd","Size":"L","Special Attacks":"See below","Special Defenses":"See below","THAC0":"17","Treasure":"Nil","XP Value":"1,400"}},"title":"Unicorn, Unisus"},"sources":["Dragon#190"],"statblock_names":[],"title":"Unicorn, Unisus","prev_key":"unicshad","next_key":"uniczebr","monster_path":"/appendix/unicunis"}},"staticQueryHashes":[],"slicesMap":{}}
