While the powers listed above are the most common, some aarakocra have different or additional powers.</p><p class=\"f\">A race of intelligent, birdlike creatures living in the deepest deserts of Athas, the rare Athasian <a href=\"/appendix/aarakocr\">aarakocra</a> spends its time soaring on thermals in search of food.</p><p>The aarakocra is 7 to 8 feet tall with a wingspan of 20 feet or more. Because of its large wingspan, an aarakocra can carry as much as 75% of its own body weight and still fly easily. An aarakocra can fly a short distance carrying a burden equaling 125% of its own body weight. The average body weight of a full grown male is 100 pounds and a female is 85 pounds.</p><p>Each wing has a &ldquo;hand&rdquo; at its midpoint, consisting of three fingers and an opposable thumb. The fourth finger forms the rigid leading edge of the wing. In flight the hands cannot be used, but on the ground the aarakocra can use its hands almost as a human would. The aarakocra's body is protected by a thin bony plate on the chest, much like a solid rib cage. Talons on its legs can be used as claws and can be retracted to reveal a second set of hands, also with three fingers and an opposable thumb. Except for the chest plate, the entire skeleton is hollow and extremely fragile.</p><p>From a distance, the Athasian aarakocra resembles a huge <a href=\"/appendix/bird\">vulture</a>. Its black eyes, set in the front of the head, provide excellent vision over a long range. The plumage is generally black with a white collar for adult males and black or brown with a smaller white collar for females. Adolescents are a mixture of brown and black. The beak is large and covers most of the head. Plumage begins at the crown of the head and is darker near the head, except for the collar. Athasian aarakocra speak their own language and the languages of vultures and other large birds. Some speak the common tongue (5% to 10% chance depending on how deep in the wastelands a tribe lives).</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Combat:</b> Aarakocra can fight in the air or on the ground. They prefer aerial combat since their bones are too fragile to withstand a solid blow from a human-sized opponent. In combat against creatures on the ground, they prefer to fly over their victim and drop weighted nets. Some aarakocra use darts to harass ground-based opponents.</p><p>If their opponents can fly, the aarakocra generally forgo the use of the net, although large groups sometimes use nets on flying creatures. Normally, aarakocra attack flying creatures with long spears, diving from above and allowing the momentum to carry the spear through the target. Such an attack doubles the damage if the aarakocra have been able to dive at least 50 feet. Only the very largest aarakocra can carry more than one of these spears, they can attack with both at once with no penalty, causing double damage on each strike. All diving attacks are made at +4 and should be treated as a charge attack. All other penalties and restrictions of charge attacks apply.</p><p>The effect of the aarakocra's nets depends on if the opponent is flying at the time it becomes entangled. Creatures on the ground that are hit by a net are entangled and unable to participate in any combat until they make a successful Strength check to get free of the net. Flying creatures hit by a net can no longer fly and immediately begin falling. If they cannot escape the net or use some magical means to arrest the fall, normal falling damage applies.</p><p>Unless victims are entangled in nets, aarakocra are cautious in ground combat. If the aarakocra outnumber their opponents they advance in a straight line and thrust with their spears. If outnumbered, or the opponents are particularly tough, the aarakocra withdraw. Victims entangled in nets are killed or incapacitated for use as food or ransom.</p><p>Athasian aarakocra are mindful of their physical limitations as well as their comparatively low psionic abilities. They do not normally initiate psionic combat. At the first sign of psionic powers from any of their victims, however, all aarakocra that have some ability will use whatever attack and defense modes they can in an attempt to destroy the threat. Large groups of is or more aarakocra may initiate psionic combat if their leaders feel they can win quickly and avoid physical combat.</p><p>In desperation, an aarakocra can attempt to bite an opponent in combat. Because of the unwieldiness of its beak, the aarakocra has a THAC0 of 18 if attacking with this appendage. Further, the birdman causes only 1d2 points of damage with the beak.</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Habitat/Society:</b> Athasian aarakocra live in tribes with 6-20 (2d8+4) members, depending on the prestige of the leader. The largest tribe ever recorded had 50 members. The tribal hunting territory depends on the size of the tribe, usually about 500 square miles for a tribe of 10 members. There are no rigid boundaries between tribes and border disputes are not uncommon.</p><p>Alignments of tribe members are similar to the alignment of the leader. A tribe that has a leader who is neutral good may have neutral good, chaotic good, lawful good, and true neutral members. A predominantly evil tribe does not recognize boundaries with other tribes and treats other tribes as inferior beings to be eliminated.</p><p>Athasian aarakocra aren't happy in enclosed spaces, but they they take refuge in a cave or building if necessary.</p><p>Nonevil tribes live in rocky aeries in the highest peaks they can find. Evil tribes are normally nomadic and use an aerie made by another tribe if they need to remain in an area for a long time, even if they have to evict the tribe that made the nest.</p><p>Aarakocra aren't friendly toward intruders in their territory, especially caravans. They try to extract a toll from the caravan for passage through the desert. Good-aligned tribes allow unhindered passage of caravans that pay a tribute. If someone refuses to pay the tribute, the aarakocra try to capture scouts or outriders from the party and hold them until an even larger tribute is paid. The payment may be either livestock or shiny objects. Aarakocra are smart enough not to be taken in by glass baubles instead of gems, although they cannot tell the difference between the more common gems and the rare ones.</p><p>Evil tribes ask for tribute and often attack a caravan whether it pays or not. Aarakocra always demand shiny objects such as stones. These tribes find humans and demihumans to be quite tasty and prefer them to other food.</p><p>Good-aligned tribes of aarakocra sometimes return a lost traveler to the edge of the desert after first removing any valuables the traveler may be carrying. On very rare occasions a tribe might return a lost group of travelers to the more frequently traveled parts of the desert, again after first taking any valuables as payment.</p><p>The oldest male is the leader of the tribal hunting party and has 4+4 Hit Dice. The oldest female is in charge of the tribal aerie and has 3+3 HD. In tribes that have more than 15 members, the next oldest aarakocra serves as shaman and has 3+3 HD; the shaman completes the triumvirate necessary for proper worship and the summoning of elementals. (Interestingly, no magic-using aarakocra has ever been recorded.) Tribes without a shaman cannot summon <a href=\"/appendix/element1\">air elementals</a>, which is an important part of aarakocra culture.</p><p>The shaman is the leader of the daily sun worship. Aarakocra worship the sun because it provides them with the thermals they need to soar in search of food. The shaman also leads the mystic rituals used to summon an air elemental. Summoning an air elemental is usually done only in preparation for the tribe's most sacred ceremony, the hunt. Small tribes must band together for this ceremony to allow the triumvirate to be formed.</p><p>The ceremony to summon an air elemental must be conducted at dawn and requires the oldest male and female to emit a highpitched keening whistle. The shaman conducts an intricate dance around them, simultaneously chanting an ancient summoning mantra.</p><p>The hunt is the final part of the initiation of adolescent aarakocra to adulthood and often takes the tribe far from their normal teritory. The target is always a <a href=\"/appendix/drakalsi\">silt drake</a>. The hunt is the only time the females leave the relative safety of the nest. Even an evil tribe will not interfere with a tribe on a hunt. An air elemental is often summoned to help find the drake, but never takes part in the actual combat. Although the adult members of the tribe take part in the initial phases of the combat, it is the initiates who deliver the final, killing blows to me drake. Scars from the hunt are considered a mark of pride among all aarakocra.</p><p>The females spend about eight months of the year incubating their eggs. Athasian aarakocra mate for life and a pair normally produces as many as 10 offspring. A female lays one egg a year. Constant incubation is not required because of the high daytime temperatures, so the females can maintain the nest and keep the tribe's treasure in order.</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Ecology:</b> Athasian aarakocra are high on the food chain and have no natural enemies other than <a href=\"/appendix/drakatha\">drakes</a>. Unless evil, aarakocra leave their own territory only to hunt the silt drake and return as soon as possible when the hunt is over. (Evil aarakocra attack others, as noted above.) Aarakocra eggs and hatchlings are sought after by wealthy land owners who wish to use the creatures as scouts and sentries. An egg can bring as much as 10 cp in Tyr's marketplace. Tribes that have had eggs or hatchlings stolen have long memories and sometimes take revenge against the thief at a later date. Captive aarakocra join any tribe they come in contact with.</p><p>Athasian aarakocra have a natural life span of 21-30 years.</p><p></p><br clear=\"all\" style=\"clear:both; height:0;\">\r\n","images":["<img src=\"grf/ds.gif\" width=\"150\" height=\"75\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Dark Sun\" title=\"Dark Sun\" align=\"right\">","<img src=\"img/aarakath.gif\" alt=\"Aarakocra (Athas)\" title=\"Aarakocra (Athas)\" border=\"0\" width=\"300\" height=\"360\" style=\"text-align:right;\" align=\"right\">","<img src=\"grf/add2_01.gif\" width=\"200\" height=\"56\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Advanced Dungeons & Dragons 2nd Edition\">"],"setting":"Dark Sun","statblock":{"Aarakocra (Athas)":{"Activity Cycle":"Day","Alignment":"Any","Armor Class":"7","Climate/Terrain":"Deep desert","Damage/Attack":"1d3/1d3 or by weapon","Diet":"Carnivore","Frequency":"Rare","Hit Dice":"2+2","Intelligence":"Average (8-10)","Magic Resistance":"Nil","Morale":"Steady (11)","Movement":"6, Fl 36 (C)","No. Appearing":"1d10","No. of Attacks":"2","Organization":"Tribal","Size":"M (20'+ wingspan)","Special Attacks":"Nil","Special Defenses":"Nil","THAC0":"17","Treasure":"Varies","XP Value":"65"}},"title":"Aarakocra (Athas)"},"sources":["2433"],"statblock_names":[],"title":"Aarakocra (Athas)","prev_key":"zygraat","next_key":"aarakocr","monster_path":"/appendix/aarakath"}}},"pageContext":{"monster_key":"scile","monster_data":{"TSR":["2635"],"fullBody":"  <table cellspacing=\"0\" cellpadding=\"0\"><tr><th>Climate/Terrain:</th><td>Quasiplane of Radiance</td></tr><tr><th>Frequency:</th><td>Common</td></tr><tr><th>Organization:</th><td>Cloud</td></tr><tr><th>Activity Cycle:</th><td>Any</td></tr><tr><th>Diet:</th><td>Color</td></tr><tr><th>Intelligence:</th><td>Low to average (7-9)</td></tr><tr><th>Treasure:</th><td>Nil</td></tr><tr><th>Alignment:</th><td>Neutral</td></tr><tr><th>No. Appearing:</th><td>10d10</td></tr><tr><th>Armor Class:</th><td>0</td></tr><tr><th>Movement:</th><td>Fl 9 (A)</td></tr><tr><th>Hit Dice:</th><td>1 hp</td></tr><tr><th>THAC0:</th><td>20</td></tr><tr><th>No. of Attacks:</th><td>0</td></tr><tr><th>Damage/Attack:</th><td>Nil</td></tr><tr><th>Special Attacks:</th><td>Drain color</td></tr><tr><th>Special Defenses:</th><td>Struck only by +1 or better weapons, immunities</td></tr><tr><th>Magic Resistance:</th><td>Nil</td></tr><tr><th>Size:</th><td>T (1/100&rdquo; long)</td></tr><tr><th>Morale:</th><td>Fanatic (17-18)</td></tr><tr><th>XP Value:</th><td>35</td></tr></table><p class=\"f\"><i>From the journals of Ucec Ordel:</i></p><p>&ldquo;Now what do I sodding do? Reide sends me on this berk's errand to the Quasielemental Planes, and I run afoul at the first one I hit. Sure, I knew that the plane of Radiance'd burn my eyes out, but I prepared for that. Rittbon Blese taught me a spell to protect me, and I knew that my sword, <i>scold</i>, could stand up to any sodding <a href=\"/appendix/quaelepo\">radiance elemental</a>. I was set.</p><p>&ldquo;Yeah, right.</p><p>&ldquo;Rittbon's spell worked, all right - my eyes didn't burn up - but I could see only a sodding short distance! That's why I never saw them coming until it was too late. Little creatures, little motes of light, swarmed at me in a cloud, almost like tiny glowing locusts. Well, they were more like sodding little sparks, really, but their light didn't flicker - it stayed constant.</p><p>&ldquo;I suppose it didn't matter what the flame they looked like. Like my father always said, if you can see 'em, you're probably already in it too sodding deep. See, these little sparks - a blood in the Cage told me they're called scile or incandescents  - feed on the colors of the quasiplane of Radiance. But they get bored eating the same old thing all the time, so if they run into some poor berk passing through, they eat <i>his</i> colors.</p><p>&ldquo;It's not like going to the Gray Waste, either, 'cause they like to eat gray just fine. No, when those motes're done with you, they leave you completely transparent. Folks can see right through you. Doesn't sound so sodding bad? Let me tell you about bad&hellip;&rdquo;</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Combat:</b> Whcn preying upon planar travelers, the scile attack in large masses. Individually, they can do little, but in a cloud of 30 or more, these little motes of light can drain the color from a sod in just a few minutes' time. All they need to do is stay within approximately 10 feet of the victim for 1d4 consecutive rounds. At the end of that time, the target gets to make a saving throw versus spell. If he fails the roll, he and his possessions lose their color and become transparent.</p><p>Transparency is a bit like invisibility, but the victim can't even see his own body, so he faces a -2 penalty to all die rolls involving physical maneuvers. After all, it's difficult and disorienting for a basher to climb if he can't see his feet or hands, to swing a sword if he can't tell how long it is, or to jump if he can't judge where he's standing. Further, if the sod casts a spell with somatic components, there's a 30% chance that he'll fail to make the proper gestures, thus wasting the spell. Transparent cutters also tend to bump into things, stub their toes, and the like - they lose all awareness of their body.</p><p>'Course, it's difficult if not impossible to use transparent items. Whether a basher is visible or color-drained, he suffers a -2 penalty when trying to use a transparent weapon or similarly physical item (transparent berks with transparent items aren't penalized twice). Transparent shields offer no bonus to Armor Class, because the wielder can't see the shield to know where it gives protection and where it doesn't. And magical items that've been rendered transparent by the scile simply fail to function.</p><p>Thankfully, the creatures' strange effect can be reversed. The application of a <i>remove curse</i> spell or <i>dust of appearance</i> restores the color to a transparent person or item, though each sod or object must be treated separately. Of course, mundane means such as paint or dyes work as well, after a fashion.</p><p>Incandescents can be struck only by weapons of +1 or greater enchantment. Because they're creatures of energy, they're immune to magic that alters physical forms, such as that which paralyzes, petrifies, polymorphs, or disintegrates. However, <i>darkness</i> spells drive scile away, and physical barriers like <i>walls of force</i> or <i>walls of ice</i> keep them at bay.</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Habitat/Society:</b> The scile never leave the quasiplane of Radiance, probably because they couldn't survive anywhere else. On their home plane, they have an intricate society based around huge, permanent cloud-clusters. Each community consists of many thousands, if not millions, and each is a completely autonomous collective - all scile are equal. The creatures can communicate via telepathy with any others of their kind in sight.</p><p>Scholars don't know how - or if - the scile reproduce. Fact is, chant has it that the number of the creatures is constant. They don't grow old or ill, so the only way for an incandescent to go to the dead-book is through violence. It's a rare occurrence, but when it happens, the lost individual is not replaced. Instead, the entire population of the scile simply decreases by one. Once they're all slain, the race will be no more.</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Ecology:</b> With all the colors of Radiance, the scile never want for food. Nevertheless, many travel the quasiplane in hunting clouds searching for non-natives, who apparently have colors that differ from those present naturally on the plane. It seems, however, that only an incandescent can notice these subtle differences.</p><p class=\"f\"><b>The Ravagers of Color</b></p><p class=\"ni\">A rare breed of evil scile is said to exist deep within the quasiplane of Radiance. These creatures eat away only certain colors, an act that somehow maliciously changes the victim. Those who know the dark of these wicked incandescents call them the Ravagers of Color.</p><p>When these creatures attack, the Dungeon Master should roll on the following table to determine what color they drain and how it affects the sod. The ravagers eat only one color per victim - once drained of that color, the target is safe from further attack. <i>Dust of appearance</i> or a <i>remove curse</i> spell will restore the lost color and negate the effect. The effect will also cease if the victim is rendered fully transparent by normal scile.</p><table class=\"ip\"><tr class=\"bk\"><th>1d6</th><th>Lost Color/Effect</th></tr><tr><td>1</td><td><i>Blue (serenity).</i> Once per day, victim has a 25% chance to fly into a rage and attack all in sight.</td></tr><tr><td>2</td><td><i>Red (passion).</i> Victim becomes listless and impossible to motivate. He must make a saving throw versus spell to take any course of action.</td></tr><tr><td>3</td><td><i>Yellow (hope).</i> Victim grows depressed, suffering a -2 penalty to all actions.</td></tr><tr><td>4</td><td><i>Green (secrets).</i> Victim becomes unable to lie, and constantly relates information to all around him.</td></tr><tr><td>5</td><td><i>Violet (intelligence).</i> Victim loses 1d2 points of Intelligence.</td></tr><tr><td>6</td><td><i>Orange (vitality).</i> Victim loses 1d2 points of Strength.</td></tr></table><p>The Ravagers of Color are chaotic evil in alignment and very intelligent. They avoid normal scile for obvious reasons, but resemble them in every way other than the effect of their attack.</p><p></p><br clear=\"all\" style=\"clear:both; height:0;\">\r\n","images":["<img src=\"grf/ps.gif\" width=\"150\" height=\"75\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Planescape\" title=\"Planescape\" align=\"right\">","<img src=\"img/scile.gif\" alt=\"Scile\" title=\"Scile\" border=\"0\" width=\"300\" height=\"360\" style=\"text-align:right;\" align=\"right\">","<img src=\"grf/add2_01.gif\" width=\"200\" height=\"56\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Advanced Dungeons & Dragons 2nd Edition\">"],"setting":"Planescape","statblock":{"Scile":{"Activity Cycle":"Any","Alignment":"Neutral","Armor Class":"0","Climate/Terrain":"Quasiplane of Radiance","Damage/Attack":"Nil","Diet":"Color","Frequency":"Common","Hit Dice":"1 hp","Intelligence":"Low to average (7-9)","Magic Resistance":"Nil","Morale":"Fanatic (17-18)","Movement":"Fl 9 (A)","No. Appearing":"10d10","No. of Attacks":"0","Organization":"Cloud","Size":"T (1/100&rdquo; long)","Special Attacks":"Drain color","Special Defenses":"Struck only by +1 or better weapons, immunities","THAC0":"20","Treasure":"Nil","XP Value":"35"}},"title":"Scile"},"sources":["2635"],"statblock_names":[],"title":"Scile","prev_key":"scavver","next_key":"scoratha","monster_path":"/appendix/scile"}},"staticQueryHashes":[],"slicesMap":{}}
