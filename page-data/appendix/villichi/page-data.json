While the powers listed above are the most common, some aarakocra have different or additional powers.</p><p class=\"f\">A race of intelligent, birdlike creatures living in the deepest deserts of Athas, the rare Athasian <a href=\"/appendix/aarakocr\">aarakocra</a> spends its time soaring on thermals in search of food.</p><p>The aarakocra is 7 to 8 feet tall with a wingspan of 20 feet or more. Because of its large wingspan, an aarakocra can carry as much as 75% of its own body weight and still fly easily. An aarakocra can fly a short distance carrying a burden equaling 125% of its own body weight. The average body weight of a full grown male is 100 pounds and a female is 85 pounds.</p><p>Each wing has a &ldquo;hand&rdquo; at its midpoint, consisting of three fingers and an opposable thumb. The fourth finger forms the rigid leading edge of the wing. In flight the hands cannot be used, but on the ground the aarakocra can use its hands almost as a human would. The aarakocra's body is protected by a thin bony plate on the chest, much like a solid rib cage. Talons on its legs can be used as claws and can be retracted to reveal a second set of hands, also with three fingers and an opposable thumb. Except for the chest plate, the entire skeleton is hollow and extremely fragile.</p><p>From a distance, the Athasian aarakocra resembles a huge <a href=\"/appendix/bird\">vulture</a>. Its black eyes, set in the front of the head, provide excellent vision over a long range. The plumage is generally black with a white collar for adult males and black or brown with a smaller white collar for females. Adolescents are a mixture of brown and black. The beak is large and covers most of the head. Plumage begins at the crown of the head and is darker near the head, except for the collar. Athasian aarakocra speak their own language and the languages of vultures and other large birds. Some speak the common tongue (5% to 10% chance depending on how deep in the wastelands a tribe lives).</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Combat:</b> Aarakocra can fight in the air or on the ground. They prefer aerial combat since their bones are too fragile to withstand a solid blow from a human-sized opponent. In combat against creatures on the ground, they prefer to fly over their victim and drop weighted nets. Some aarakocra use darts to harass ground-based opponents.</p><p>If their opponents can fly, the aarakocra generally forgo the use of the net, although large groups sometimes use nets on flying creatures. Normally, aarakocra attack flying creatures with long spears, diving from above and allowing the momentum to carry the spear through the target. Such an attack doubles the damage if the aarakocra have been able to dive at least 50 feet. Only the very largest aarakocra can carry more than one of these spears, they can attack with both at once with no penalty, causing double damage on each strike. All diving attacks are made at +4 and should be treated as a charge attack. All other penalties and restrictions of charge attacks apply.</p><p>The effect of the aarakocra's nets depends on if the opponent is flying at the time it becomes entangled. Creatures on the ground that are hit by a net are entangled and unable to participate in any combat until they make a successful Strength check to get free of the net. Flying creatures hit by a net can no longer fly and immediately begin falling. If they cannot escape the net or use some magical means to arrest the fall, normal falling damage applies.</p><p>Unless victims are entangled in nets, aarakocra are cautious in ground combat. If the aarakocra outnumber their opponents they advance in a straight line and thrust with their spears. If outnumbered, or the opponents are particularly tough, the aarakocra withdraw. Victims entangled in nets are killed or incapacitated for use as food or ransom.</p><p>Athasian aarakocra are mindful of their physical limitations as well as their comparatively low psionic abilities. They do not normally initiate psionic combat. At the first sign of psionic powers from any of their victims, however, all aarakocra that have some ability will use whatever attack and defense modes they can in an attempt to destroy the threat. Large groups of is or more aarakocra may initiate psionic combat if their leaders feel they can win quickly and avoid physical combat.</p><p>In desperation, an aarakocra can attempt to bite an opponent in combat. Because of the unwieldiness of its beak, the aarakocra has a THAC0 of 18 if attacking with this appendage. Further, the birdman causes only 1d2 points of damage with the beak.</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Habitat/Society:</b> Athasian aarakocra live in tribes with 6-20 (2d8+4) members, depending on the prestige of the leader. The largest tribe ever recorded had 50 members. The tribal hunting territory depends on the size of the tribe, usually about 500 square miles for a tribe of 10 members. There are no rigid boundaries between tribes and border disputes are not uncommon.</p><p>Alignments of tribe members are similar to the alignment of the leader. A tribe that has a leader who is neutral good may have neutral good, chaotic good, lawful good, and true neutral members. A predominantly evil tribe does not recognize boundaries with other tribes and treats other tribes as inferior beings to be eliminated.</p><p>Athasian aarakocra aren't happy in enclosed spaces, but they they take refuge in a cave or building if necessary.</p><p>Nonevil tribes live in rocky aeries in the highest peaks they can find. Evil tribes are normally nomadic and use an aerie made by another tribe if they need to remain in an area for a long time, even if they have to evict the tribe that made the nest.</p><p>Aarakocra aren't friendly toward intruders in their territory, especially caravans. They try to extract a toll from the caravan for passage through the desert. Good-aligned tribes allow unhindered passage of caravans that pay a tribute. If someone refuses to pay the tribute, the aarakocra try to capture scouts or outriders from the party and hold them until an even larger tribute is paid. The payment may be either livestock or shiny objects. Aarakocra are smart enough not to be taken in by glass baubles instead of gems, although they cannot tell the difference between the more common gems and the rare ones.</p><p>Evil tribes ask for tribute and often attack a caravan whether it pays or not. Aarakocra always demand shiny objects such as stones. These tribes find humans and demihumans to be quite tasty and prefer them to other food.</p><p>Good-aligned tribes of aarakocra sometimes return a lost traveler to the edge of the desert after first removing any valuables the traveler may be carrying. On very rare occasions a tribe might return a lost group of travelers to the more frequently traveled parts of the desert, again after first taking any valuables as payment.</p><p>The oldest male is the leader of the tribal hunting party and has 4+4 Hit Dice. The oldest female is in charge of the tribal aerie and has 3+3 HD. In tribes that have more than 15 members, the next oldest aarakocra serves as shaman and has 3+3 HD; the shaman completes the triumvirate necessary for proper worship and the summoning of elementals. (Interestingly, no magic-using aarakocra has ever been recorded.) Tribes without a shaman cannot summon <a href=\"/appendix/element1\">air elementals</a>, which is an important part of aarakocra culture.</p><p>The shaman is the leader of the daily sun worship. Aarakocra worship the sun because it provides them with the thermals they need to soar in search of food. The shaman also leads the mystic rituals used to summon an air elemental. Summoning an air elemental is usually done only in preparation for the tribe's most sacred ceremony, the hunt. Small tribes must band together for this ceremony to allow the triumvirate to be formed.</p><p>The ceremony to summon an air elemental must be conducted at dawn and requires the oldest male and female to emit a highpitched keening whistle. The shaman conducts an intricate dance around them, simultaneously chanting an ancient summoning mantra.</p><p>The hunt is the final part of the initiation of adolescent aarakocra to adulthood and often takes the tribe far from their normal teritory. The target is always a <a href=\"/appendix/drakalsi\">silt drake</a>. The hunt is the only time the females leave the relative safety of the nest. Even an evil tribe will not interfere with a tribe on a hunt. An air elemental is often summoned to help find the drake, but never takes part in the actual combat. Although the adult members of the tribe take part in the initial phases of the combat, it is the initiates who deliver the final, killing blows to me drake. Scars from the hunt are considered a mark of pride among all aarakocra.</p><p>The females spend about eight months of the year incubating their eggs. Athasian aarakocra mate for life and a pair normally produces as many as 10 offspring. A female lays one egg a year. Constant incubation is not required because of the high daytime temperatures, so the females can maintain the nest and keep the tribe's treasure in order.</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Ecology:</b> Athasian aarakocra are high on the food chain and have no natural enemies other than <a href=\"/appendix/drakatha\">drakes</a>. Unless evil, aarakocra leave their own territory only to hunt the silt drake and return as soon as possible when the hunt is over. (Evil aarakocra attack others, as noted above.) Aarakocra eggs and hatchlings are sought after by wealthy land owners who wish to use the creatures as scouts and sentries. An egg can bring as much as 10 cp in Tyr's marketplace. Tribes that have had eggs or hatchlings stolen have long memories and sometimes take revenge against the thief at a later date. Captive aarakocra join any tribe they come in contact with.</p><p>Athasian aarakocra have a natural life span of 21-30 years.</p><p></p><br clear=\"all\" style=\"clear:both; height:0;\">\r\n","images":["<img src=\"grf/ds.gif\" width=\"150\" height=\"75\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Dark Sun\" title=\"Dark Sun\" align=\"right\">","<img src=\"img/aarakath.gif\" alt=\"Aarakocra (Athas)\" title=\"Aarakocra (Athas)\" border=\"0\" width=\"300\" height=\"360\" style=\"text-align:right;\" align=\"right\">","<img src=\"grf/add2_01.gif\" width=\"200\" height=\"56\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Advanced Dungeons & Dragons 2nd Edition\">"],"setting":"Dark Sun","statblock":{"Aarakocra (Athas)":{"Activity Cycle":"Day","Alignment":"Any","Armor Class":"7","Climate/Terrain":"Deep desert","Damage/Attack":"1d3/1d3 or by weapon","Diet":"Carnivore","Frequency":"Rare","Hit Dice":"2+2","Intelligence":"Average (8-10)","Magic Resistance":"Nil","Morale":"Steady (11)","Movement":"6, Fl 36 (C)","No. Appearing":"1d10","No. of Attacks":"2","Organization":"Tribal","Size":"M (20'+ wingspan)","Special Attacks":"Nil","Special Defenses":"Nil","THAC0":"17","Treasure":"Varies","XP Value":"65"}},"title":"Aarakocra (Athas)"},"sources":["2433"],"statblock_names":[],"title":"Aarakocra (Athas)","prev_key":"zygraat","next_key":"aarakocr","monster_path":"/appendix/aarakath"}}},"pageContext":{"monster_key":"villichi","monster_data":{"TSR":["2405"],"fullBody":"  <table cellspacing=\"0\" cellpadding=\"0\"><tr><th>Climate/Terrain:</th><td>Any</td></tr><tr><th>Frequency:</th><td>Very rare</td></tr><tr><th>Organization:</th><td>Community</td></tr><tr><th>Activity Cycle:</th><td>Any</td></tr><tr><th>Diet:</th><td>Omnivore</td></tr><tr><th>Intelligence:</th><td>High (13-14)</td></tr><tr><th>Treasure:</th><td>K,R</td></tr><tr><th>Alignment:</th><td>Lawful neutral</td></tr><tr><th>No. Appearing:</th><td>1-4</td></tr><tr><th>Armor Class:</th><td>Varies</td></tr><tr><th>Movement:</th><td>24</td></tr><tr><th>Hit Dice:</th><td>Varies</td></tr><tr><th>THAC0:</th><td>Varies</td></tr><tr><th>No. of Attacks:</th><td>1</td></tr><tr><th>Damage/Attack:</th><td>By weapon</td></tr><tr><th>Special Attacks:</th><td>Nil</td></tr><tr><th>Special Defenses:</th><td>Nil</td></tr><tr><th>Magic Resistance:</th><td>10%</td></tr><tr><th>Size:</th><td>M (7' tall)</td></tr><tr><th>Morale:</th><td>Varies</td></tr><tr><th>XP Value:</th><td>Varies</td></tr></table><p class=\"f\"><b>Psionics Summary</b></p><table class=\"ip\"><tr class=\"bk\"><th>Level</th><th>Dis/Sci/Dev</th><th>Attacks/Defenses</th><th>Score</th><th>PSPs</th></tr><tr><td>3</td><td>2/2/7</td><td>II/M-,TS</td><td>15</td><td>52</td></tr><tr><td>4</td><td>2/2/9</td><td> </td><td>15</td><td>65</td></tr><tr><td>5</td><td>2/3/10</td><td>PB/TW</td><td>15</td><td>78</td></tr><tr><td>6</td><td>3/3/11</td><td> </td><td>15</td><td>91</td></tr><tr><td>7</td><td>3/4/12</td><td>PC/IF</td><td>15</td><td>104</td></tr><tr><td>8</td><td>3/4/13</td><td> </td><td>15</td><td>117</td></tr><tr><td>9</td><td>3/5/14</td><td>-/MB</td><td>15</td><td>130</td></tr><tr><td>10</td><td>4/5/15</td><td> </td><td>15</td><td>143</td></tr><tr><td>11</td><td>4/6/16</td><td> </td><td>15</td><td>156</td></tr><tr><td>12</td><td>4/6/17</td><td> </td><td>15</td><td>169</td></tr></table><p class=\"ni\"><b>Psychokinesis -</b> <i>Science:</i> telekinesis;<i> Devotions:</i> ballistic attack, inertial barrier.</p><p class=\"ni\"><b>Telepathy -</b> <i>Science:</i> mindlink; <i>Devotions:</i> contact, id insinuation, invincible foes, mind blank, thought shield.</p><p class=\"ni\">At 4 HD, add:<br><b>Psychokinesis -</b> <i>Sciences:</i> nil; <i>Devotions:</i> control body, control sound.</p><p class=\"ni\">At 5 HD, add:<br><b>Telepathy -</b> <i>Science:</i> tower of iron will; <i>Devotion:</i> psychic crush.</p><p class=\"ni\">At 6 HD, add:<br><b>Clairsentience -</b> <i>Sciences:</i> nil; <i>Devotion:</i> know location.</p><p class=\"ni\">At 7 HD, add:<br><b>Telepathy -</b> <i>Science:</i> psionic blast; <i>Devotion:</i> intellect fortress.</p><p class=\"ni\">At 8 HD, add:<br><b>Clairsentience -</b> <i>Sciences:</i> nil; <i>Devotion:</i> danger sense.</p><p class=\"ni\">At 9 HD, add:<br><b>Psychokinesis -</b> <i>Science:</i> project force; <i>Devotions:</i> nil.<br><b>Telepathy -</b> <i>Sciences:</i> nil; <i>Devotion:</i> mental barrier.</p><p class=\"ni\">At 10 HD, add:<br><b>Psychometabolism -</b> <i>Sciences:</i> nil; <i>Devotion:</i> cell adjustment.</p><p class=\"ni\">At 11 HD, add:<br><b>Psychometabolism</b> <i>Sciences:</i> nil; <i>Devotion:</i> graft weapon<br><b>Telepathy -</b> <i>Science:</i> superior invisibility; <i>Devotions:</i> nil.</p><p class=\"ni\">At 12 HD, add:<br><b>Psychometabolism -</b> <i>Science:</i> animal affinity; <i>Devotions:</i> nil.</p><p class=\"f\">Villichi are females born to normal humans. No one can predict when or where a villichi child will be born. They are shunned by normal humans, although it is considered a bad omen to turn out a villichi child. When they come of age they usually move to a convent of their kind, located somewhere in the Ringing Mountains. Villichi are very strong psionicists, and consequently, are a powerful group. Encounters with villichi are usually with an envoy, one sent to deal with a trading company or village.</p><p>Villichi resemble normal human females, albeit longer of limb and face. While they appear thin (mostly due to their height), they actually have normal proportions for human women. Villichi are usually cloaked as they are especially susceptible to the burning sun.</p><p>Villichi all speak 1d4 languages spoken by humans or demihumans.</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Combat:</b> Villichi are not aggressive, usually fighting only in defense of their lives or their community. They are all psionicists, of levels 3-12. Encounters outside their convent are with an envoy of at least 7th level (1d6+6). If more than one is encountered, the rest are guards/companions of levels 3-11. To determine the levels of the companions, roll 1d6 for each and subtract it from the level of the envoy.</p><p>When away from the convent, villichi usually wear leather armor. Villichi have a good Dexterity (15+1d6) giving them an Armor Class of at least 7, and possibly as high as 3. There is a 7% chance per level that an envoy will possess a magical ring or cloak; companions have a 5% chance per level of the same. This may further improve their Armor Class or allow them to dispense with the leather armor. They use hand axes, daggers, or short swords (33% chance for each), but there is only a 3% chance per level that anyone in the group possesses a magical weapon. Villichi never use metal weapons or armor, feeling that it makes them somehow unclean.</p><p>The villichi preferred method of attack is psionics, and their powers make them formidable. They are extremely well-versed in psionic combat - if someone uses a particular defense, they immediately switch to the most effective attack that they possess to counter that defense. Only if attacked by a creature unaffected by psionics will they use their weapons. (The exception to this is if they successfully use their invincible foes power against a susceptible opponent. They will then attempt to hit that particular opponent at least once, forcing him to fall to the ground in horrible pain.)</p><p>Villichi are willing to use magic items, but they are not really comfortable with them. They are slightly resistant to magic, and there is no record of a villichi ever using mage or priest spells.</p><p>The Villichi's long thin frame gives them good leverage, and they receive excellent training in the use of weapons. All villichi have a +1 attack roll bonus with any non-metal weapon usable by psionicists.</p><p>If the villichi are losing a battle, the companions readily sacrifice their lives to allow the envoy to escape. If the envoy is killed, the highest level companion immediately becomes the envoy and seeks to escape while any remaining companions attempt to hold off the opponents. Of course, if possible, they all try to flee or hide, rather than sacrificing themselves. Villichi never fight blindly to the death, trying to find the best option to let the envoy and her companions all survive.</p><p>Villichi are somewhat sensitive to the sun and always try to wear cloaks (or some other covering) to protect them. If a villichi is directly exposed to sunlight (for instance, if her cloak is torn off), she receives a -1 attack roll penalty and a -1 penalty to all psionic power scores.</p><p>Villichi of 12th level develop animal affinity, and 90% of these develop affinity with <a href=\"/appendix/eagle\">eagles</a> or <a href=\"/appendix/hawk\">hawks</a>. Envoys with this power can fly away if a battle is going badly.</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Habitat/Society:</b> Villichi have formed an extremely close knit community. They never attack one another and only rarely argue with each other. The location of the convent is a closely guarded secret; anyone who inadvertently finds it is usually mindwiped. <a href=\"/appendix/gianhalf\">Half-giants</a> and <a href=\"/appendix/elfathas\">half elves</a> are looked upon with compassion, since they too are members of a group that meets with prejudice. This treatment may seem cruel, but it is a cruel world, and the villichi are only concerned with surviving.</p><p>All villichi are born to human parents, and since it is considered a bad omen to exile a villichi child, they are left alone. Villichi not only mature rapidly, but they are fairly long-lived. The average lifespan of a villichi female is 150 years, although some live even longer. The current &ldquo;high mistress&rdquo; is over 200 years old, and is a psionicist of great power.</p><p>The high mistress is always chosen from among villichi who have developed the special power of &ldquo;locate psionic&rdquo;. This special power is only developed by villichi of 13th level or higher, and only 10% of them develop this power. There is no range limit to this power, which allows them to locate villichi children at an early age. By the time a villichi child comes of age, an envoy will have been dispatched to fetch the child, or at least inform her of the location of the convent. This also allows them to determine if a villichi child is slain. Such an action usually results in revenge upon the perpetrator. If the perpetrator cannot be located, the revenge is carried out on the entire town, if possible. This is certainly part of the reason why killing a villichi child is considered such a bad omen. Past reprisals have made the killing of a villichi child a very rare thing indeed. Should such a killing occur, the townspeople will most likely imprison the guilty party and turn him over to an envoy for punishment. The perpetrator is examined by the envoy, and executed if guilty. Rumors abound that the guilty party dies horribly, causing such criminals to go to desperate lengths to avoid capture and conviction. Contrary to the rumors, however, the execution is quick and painless, usually by a dagger in the back of the neck.</p><p>There are currently about 500 villichi at the convent. At any one time, 10-20% of these are travelling as envoys, and another 20% are young villichi, level 2 or below.</p><p>The villichi are adept at weaving and make some of the best cloth on Athas. They also grow most of their own food, but they are not skilled at manufacturing and must trade for weapons and other supplies they need to survive. Higher level villichi are skilled at empowering items with psionic powers, and a magic (actually psionic) item may be traded for enough supplies to last the convent for as much as six months. Such items are necessarily rare and are highly sought after. Of the items empowered, the majority (75%) are usually gems with two or three psionic powers. The convent has 3-6 (1d4+2) of these items on hand at all times. They are usually saved for defense of the convent, but may also be used for trading if necessary for the community's survival. The few trading houses that deal regularly with the villichi have regular meeting places and know better than to look for the convent. The villichi prefer to trade their fine quality cloth, although they cannot usually produce enough to support their convent. At least one psionically empowered item is traded each year, but never more than three, even in bad years.</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Ecology:</b> The villichi roam widely throughout the world, for anywhere that humans live, a villichi child may be born. This is quite rare; perhaps one in 30,000 girls born is a villichi child. They are not quite albinos, although they do not like the sun. Their habit of protecting themselves from the sun makes them quite fair skinned, and on Athas, this makes them stand out.</p><p>Envoys eat whatever is available to them when travelling; but in their convent, the villichi are strict vegetarians. They also use no metal, even in building or trade. If presented with gold, the villichi try to trade it, either for gems or for ceramic pieces. The villichi are fascinated with gems and sometimes pay up to double price for a particularly nice one. Traders with rare and valuable gems may seek to find the villichi convent, thinking to make a killing on a trade. Those who find it are usually sorry, if they even remember what happened.</p><p>The villichi community is quite powerful for the small number of females it represents. Even the sorcerer-kings hesitate to interfere with a villichi envoy. The villichi are intelligent enough to realize that this could change if they interfere with these powerful defilers, since any one of the sorcerer-kings possesses sufficient power and resources to wipe out the convent (if they tried hard enough to do so). But, such a mission might weaken the king's defenses enough that he would fall prey to a rival king. Thus the villichi lead a comfortable life, aided mainly by the fact that they stay out of the sorcerer-kings' business and also by the fact that their convent is in an extremely remote location.</p><p>Villichi women are all quite attractive, but they are also sterile. Should a group of raiders harm or slay an envoy, a large group of envoys is sent to find and exact revenge on the perpetrators of this unspeakable crime. A group of envoys out for revenge in this manner always numbers at least 20, and the least powerful of these is 8th level, while they are led by a elder of 11th or 12th level. Such criminals are put to death in the most painful manner possible to these intelligent, vengeful females. Fortunately, the villichi reputation makes such incidents extremely rare.</p><p></p><br clear=\"all\" style=\"clear:both; height:0;\">\r\n","images":["<img src=\"grf/ds.gif\" width=\"150\" height=\"75\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Dark Sun\" title=\"Dark Sun\" align=\"right\">","<img src=\"img/villichi.gif\" alt=\"Villichi\" title=\"Villichi\" border=\"0\" width=\"300\" height=\"360\" style=\"text-align:right;\" align=\"right\">","<img src=\"grf/add2_01.gif\" width=\"200\" height=\"56\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Advanced Dungeons & Dragons 2nd Edition\">"],"setting":"Dark Sun","statblock":{"Villichi":{"Activity Cycle":"Any","Alignment":"Lawful neutral","Armor Class":"Varies","Climate/Terrain":"Any","Damage/Attack":"By weapon","Diet":"Omnivore","Frequency":"Very rare","Hit Dice":"Varies","Intelligence":"High (13-14)","Magic Resistance":"10%","Morale":"Varies","Movement":"24","No. Appearing":"1-4","No. of Attacks":"1","Organization":"Community","Size":"M (7' tall)","Special Attacks":"Nil","Special Defenses":"Nil","THAC0":"Varies","Treasure":"K,R","XP Value":"Varies"}},"title":"Villichi"},"sources":["2405"],"statblock_names":[],"title":"Villichi","prev_key":"vilay","next_key":"vineinfi","monster_path":"/appendix/villichi"}},"staticQueryHashes":[],"slicesMap":{}}
