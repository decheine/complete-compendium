While the powers listed above are the most common, some aarakocra have different or additional powers.</p><p class=\"f\">A race of intelligent, birdlike creatures living in the deepest deserts of Athas, the rare Athasian <a href=\"/appendix/aarakocr\">aarakocra</a> spends its time soaring on thermals in search of food.</p><p>The aarakocra is 7 to 8 feet tall with a wingspan of 20 feet or more. Because of its large wingspan, an aarakocra can carry as much as 75% of its own body weight and still fly easily. An aarakocra can fly a short distance carrying a burden equaling 125% of its own body weight. The average body weight of a full grown male is 100 pounds and a female is 85 pounds.</p><p>Each wing has a &ldquo;hand&rdquo; at its midpoint, consisting of three fingers and an opposable thumb. The fourth finger forms the rigid leading edge of the wing. In flight the hands cannot be used, but on the ground the aarakocra can use its hands almost as a human would. The aarakocra's body is protected by a thin bony plate on the chest, much like a solid rib cage. Talons on its legs can be used as claws and can be retracted to reveal a second set of hands, also with three fingers and an opposable thumb. Except for the chest plate, the entire skeleton is hollow and extremely fragile.</p><p>From a distance, the Athasian aarakocra resembles a huge <a href=\"/appendix/bird\">vulture</a>. Its black eyes, set in the front of the head, provide excellent vision over a long range. The plumage is generally black with a white collar for adult males and black or brown with a smaller white collar for females. Adolescents are a mixture of brown and black. The beak is large and covers most of the head. Plumage begins at the crown of the head and is darker near the head, except for the collar. Athasian aarakocra speak their own language and the languages of vultures and other large birds. Some speak the common tongue (5% to 10% chance depending on how deep in the wastelands a tribe lives).</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Combat:</b> Aarakocra can fight in the air or on the ground. They prefer aerial combat since their bones are too fragile to withstand a solid blow from a human-sized opponent. In combat against creatures on the ground, they prefer to fly over their victim and drop weighted nets. Some aarakocra use darts to harass ground-based opponents.</p><p>If their opponents can fly, the aarakocra generally forgo the use of the net, although large groups sometimes use nets on flying creatures. Normally, aarakocra attack flying creatures with long spears, diving from above and allowing the momentum to carry the spear through the target. Such an attack doubles the damage if the aarakocra have been able to dive at least 50 feet. Only the very largest aarakocra can carry more than one of these spears, they can attack with both at once with no penalty, causing double damage on each strike. All diving attacks are made at +4 and should be treated as a charge attack. All other penalties and restrictions of charge attacks apply.</p><p>The effect of the aarakocra's nets depends on if the opponent is flying at the time it becomes entangled. Creatures on the ground that are hit by a net are entangled and unable to participate in any combat until they make a successful Strength check to get free of the net. Flying creatures hit by a net can no longer fly and immediately begin falling. If they cannot escape the net or use some magical means to arrest the fall, normal falling damage applies.</p><p>Unless victims are entangled in nets, aarakocra are cautious in ground combat. If the aarakocra outnumber their opponents they advance in a straight line and thrust with their spears. If outnumbered, or the opponents are particularly tough, the aarakocra withdraw. Victims entangled in nets are killed or incapacitated for use as food or ransom.</p><p>Athasian aarakocra are mindful of their physical limitations as well as their comparatively low psionic abilities. They do not normally initiate psionic combat. At the first sign of psionic powers from any of their victims, however, all aarakocra that have some ability will use whatever attack and defense modes they can in an attempt to destroy the threat. Large groups of is or more aarakocra may initiate psionic combat if their leaders feel they can win quickly and avoid physical combat.</p><p>In desperation, an aarakocra can attempt to bite an opponent in combat. Because of the unwieldiness of its beak, the aarakocra has a THAC0 of 18 if attacking with this appendage. Further, the birdman causes only 1d2 points of damage with the beak.</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Habitat/Society:</b> Athasian aarakocra live in tribes with 6-20 (2d8+4) members, depending on the prestige of the leader. The largest tribe ever recorded had 50 members. The tribal hunting territory depends on the size of the tribe, usually about 500 square miles for a tribe of 10 members. There are no rigid boundaries between tribes and border disputes are not uncommon.</p><p>Alignments of tribe members are similar to the alignment of the leader. A tribe that has a leader who is neutral good may have neutral good, chaotic good, lawful good, and true neutral members. A predominantly evil tribe does not recognize boundaries with other tribes and treats other tribes as inferior beings to be eliminated.</p><p>Athasian aarakocra aren't happy in enclosed spaces, but they they take refuge in a cave or building if necessary.</p><p>Nonevil tribes live in rocky aeries in the highest peaks they can find. Evil tribes are normally nomadic and use an aerie made by another tribe if they need to remain in an area for a long time, even if they have to evict the tribe that made the nest.</p><p>Aarakocra aren't friendly toward intruders in their territory, especially caravans. They try to extract a toll from the caravan for passage through the desert. Good-aligned tribes allow unhindered passage of caravans that pay a tribute. If someone refuses to pay the tribute, the aarakocra try to capture scouts or outriders from the party and hold them until an even larger tribute is paid. The payment may be either livestock or shiny objects. Aarakocra are smart enough not to be taken in by glass baubles instead of gems, although they cannot tell the difference between the more common gems and the rare ones.</p><p>Evil tribes ask for tribute and often attack a caravan whether it pays or not. Aarakocra always demand shiny objects such as stones. These tribes find humans and demihumans to be quite tasty and prefer them to other food.</p><p>Good-aligned tribes of aarakocra sometimes return a lost traveler to the edge of the desert after first removing any valuables the traveler may be carrying. On very rare occasions a tribe might return a lost group of travelers to the more frequently traveled parts of the desert, again after first taking any valuables as payment.</p><p>The oldest male is the leader of the tribal hunting party and has 4+4 Hit Dice. The oldest female is in charge of the tribal aerie and has 3+3 HD. In tribes that have more than 15 members, the next oldest aarakocra serves as shaman and has 3+3 HD; the shaman completes the triumvirate necessary for proper worship and the summoning of elementals. (Interestingly, no magic-using aarakocra has ever been recorded.) Tribes without a shaman cannot summon <a href=\"/appendix/element1\">air elementals</a>, which is an important part of aarakocra culture.</p><p>The shaman is the leader of the daily sun worship. Aarakocra worship the sun because it provides them with the thermals they need to soar in search of food. The shaman also leads the mystic rituals used to summon an air elemental. Summoning an air elemental is usually done only in preparation for the tribe's most sacred ceremony, the hunt. Small tribes must band together for this ceremony to allow the triumvirate to be formed.</p><p>The ceremony to summon an air elemental must be conducted at dawn and requires the oldest male and female to emit a highpitched keening whistle. The shaman conducts an intricate dance around them, simultaneously chanting an ancient summoning mantra.</p><p>The hunt is the final part of the initiation of adolescent aarakocra to adulthood and often takes the tribe far from their normal teritory. The target is always a <a href=\"/appendix/drakalsi\">silt drake</a>. The hunt is the only time the females leave the relative safety of the nest. Even an evil tribe will not interfere with a tribe on a hunt. An air elemental is often summoned to help find the drake, but never takes part in the actual combat. Although the adult members of the tribe take part in the initial phases of the combat, it is the initiates who deliver the final, killing blows to me drake. Scars from the hunt are considered a mark of pride among all aarakocra.</p><p>The females spend about eight months of the year incubating their eggs. Athasian aarakocra mate for life and a pair normally produces as many as 10 offspring. A female lays one egg a year. Constant incubation is not required because of the high daytime temperatures, so the females can maintain the nest and keep the tribe's treasure in order.</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Ecology:</b> Athasian aarakocra are high on the food chain and have no natural enemies other than <a href=\"/appendix/drakatha\">drakes</a>. Unless evil, aarakocra leave their own territory only to hunt the silt drake and return as soon as possible when the hunt is over. (Evil aarakocra attack others, as noted above.) Aarakocra eggs and hatchlings are sought after by wealthy land owners who wish to use the creatures as scouts and sentries. An egg can bring as much as 10 cp in Tyr's marketplace. Tribes that have had eggs or hatchlings stolen have long memories and sometimes take revenge against the thief at a later date. Captive aarakocra join any tribe they come in contact with.</p><p>Athasian aarakocra have a natural life span of 21-30 years.</p><br clear=\"all\" style=\"clear:both; height:0;\">\r\n","images":["<img src=\"grf/ds.gif\" width=\"150\" height=\"75\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Dark Sun\" title=\"Dark Sun\" align=\"right\">","<img src=\"img/aarakath.gif\" alt=\"Aarakocra (Athas)\" title=\"Aarakocra (Athas)\" border=\"0\" width=\"300\" height=\"360\" style=\"text-align:right;\" align=\"right\">","<img src=\"grf/add2_01.gif\" width=\"200\" height=\"56\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Advanced Dungeons & Dragons 2nd Edition\">"],"setting":"Dark Sun","statblock":{"Aarakocra (Athas)":{"Activity Cycle":"Day","Alignment":"Any","Armor Class":"7","Climate/Terrain":"Deep desert","Damage/Attack":"1d3/1d3 or by weapon","Diet":"Carnivore","Frequency":"Rare","Hit Dice":"2+2","Intelligence":"Average (8-10)","Magic Resistance":"Nil","Morale":"Steady (11)","Movement":"6, Fl 36 (C)","No. Appearing":"1d10","No. of Attacks":"2","Organization":"Tribal","Size":"M (20'+ wingspan)","Special Attacks":"Nil","Special Defenses":"Nil","THAC0":"17","Treasure":"Varies","XP Value":"65"}},"title":"Aarakocra (Athas)"},"sources":["2433"],"statblock_names":[],"title":"Aarakocra (Athas)","prev_key":"zygraat","next_key":"aarakocr","monster_path":"/appendix/aarakath"}}},"pageContext":{"monster_key":"genizkda","monster_data":{"TSR":["1077"],"fullBody":"  <table cellspacing=\"0\" cellpadding=\"0\"><tr><th>Climate/Terrain:</th><td>Earth, mountains</td></tr><tr><th>Frequency:</th><td>Rare</td></tr><tr><th>Organization:</th><td>Khanate</td></tr><tr><th>Activity Cycle:</th><td>Day</td></tr><tr><th>Diet:</th><td>Omnivore</td></tr><tr><th>Intelligence:</th><td>Low to very (5-12)</td></tr><tr><th>Treasure:</th><td>F</td></tr><tr><th>Alignment:</th><td>Neutral evil</td></tr><tr><th>No. Appearing:</th><td>1</td></tr><tr><th>Armor Class:</th><td>3</td></tr><tr><th>Movement:</th><td>9, Fl 15 (B), Br 6</td></tr><tr><th>Hit Dice:</th><td>8+3</td></tr><tr><th>THAC0:</th><td>13</td></tr><tr><th>No. of Attacks:</th><td>1</td></tr><tr><th>Damage/Attack:</th><td>3-18 (3d6)</td></tr><tr><th>Special Attacks:</th><td>See below</td></tr><tr><th>Special Defenses:</th><td>Earth resistance; see below</td></tr><tr><th>Magic Resistance:</th><td>Nil</td></tr><tr><th>Size:</th><td>L (8-11 ft. tall)</td></tr><tr><th>Morale:</th><td>Champion (15-16)</td></tr><tr><th>XP Value:</th><td>6,000</td></tr></table><p class=\"f\">Dao are malicious genies from the Elemental Plane of Earth (<i>Dao</i> is both singular and plural.) There they dwell in great numbers, continually delving and shaping the rock around them. On the Prime Material Plane, dao are usually solitary, although powerful individuals (such as the evil yak-men) sometimes manage to command a group of them. Of all the genie races, dao are the ost simple and brutish, and can often be cozened into service.</p><p class=\"f\">Like most genies, dao have a limited form of telepathy that enables them to converse with any intelligent being (low intelligence or better). They may use this ability as translators, but will often accentuate the negatives when doing so, making each side appear hostile and boastful to the other. Dao also speak Midani and the native tongue of all geniekind. The dao dialect is rumbling and low-pitched, with grinding consonants and trilling vowels.</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Combat:</b> Dao can use each of the following spell-like powers once per day, one at a time: <i>detect good</i>, <i>detect magic</i>, <i>assume gaseous form</i>, <i>attract evil eye</i>, become <i>invisible</i>, cause <i>misdirection</i>, <i>passwall</i>, create a <i>spectral force</i>, create a <i>wall of stone</i>, and <i>change self</i>. With the last power, a dao can reduce its height to 2 feet or increase it to 20 feet (a variation of the spell). Three times per day, the dao can turn <i>rock to mud</i> (or the reverse, <i>mud to rock</i>). Six times per day, the dao can <i>dig</i>. Powers are at the 18th level of wizardry.</p><p class=\"f\">A dao can also grant a limited <i>wish</i>, once per day, but with severe restrictions. First, the genie can only grant a wish to a native of the Prime Material Plane. A dao cannot grant a wish to another genie, including a janni, nor can a wish be granted to a creature such as a cambion, which belongs to both the Prime Material and other planes. Most importantly, the dao can only grant a wish that will be fulfilled in a twisted or malignant way. (Details are determined by the DM; not-even the dao can always predict such results.) For example, an individual who wishes to regain hit points may do so, but at the cost of draining hit points from allies. A wizard who requests a new spell may receive it, but become afflicted with the evil eye. And those who wish for shelter may discover a palace, only to find it inhabited by some foul monster. Most of those who request wishes from dao are aware of these restrictions and proceed with caution. (While an evil master who has enslaved a dao may demand a wish, the master should know that the wish is likely to cause him or her great harm.)</p><p class=\"f\">Dao are immune to earth-based and earth-affecting spells, including those from the province of sand (elemental earth). Holy water is the dao's bane; they suffer twice the usual amount of damage from it. That damage will be marked for years to come, because the liquid scars them as easily as water carves ravines through sand.</p><p class=\"f\">A dao can carry up to 500 pounds without tiring, either when flying or walking (or simply standing). Doubling the weight causes the dao to tire in three turns, but for every 100 pounds under 1,000, the dao can bear the load one additional turn. For example, a dao can carry 600 pounds for seven turns without tiring. After being exhausted in this fashion, a dao must rest for six turns.</p><p class=\"f\">Dao can move through earth at a burrowing rate of 6. They can't dig through worked stone or solid rock, however. Companions can't follow, since the tunnel closes up behind the burrowing dao, filled by debris carved out from ahead. However, a burrowing dao can still carry inanimate objects, and such an \"object\" might conceivably be a passenger, albeit an uncomfortable one (DM's discretion applies).</p><p class=\"f\">Dao usually stand and fight if threatened. If they're overmatched, however, most flee by taking to the air or by burrowing-and then return with enough reinforcements to squash those who would besmirch a dao's honor. Dao are often uncomfortable in an enclosed area of worked stone because it prevents them retreating easily.</p><p class=\"f\">Though dao are evil, they are also honorable in their own way. If shown kindness and fairness, a dao will return them in kind (taking everything else it can get as well). Dao make excellent advisors, particularly if they know that by helping a mortal they can cause harm to other mortals. These genies hate enslavement as much as the efreet, and will seek out sha'irs who have imprisoned their brethren - either to slay the sha'irs or to take them as slaves.</p><img src=\"/img/spc/genizkda1.gif\" width=\"300\" height=\"360\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Genie of Zakhara, Dao\" title=\"Genie of Zakhara, Dao\" style=\"float:left;\"/><p class=\"f\"><i>Interplanar Travel</i>: Dao can travel freely to any of the elemental planes, as well as to the Prime Material, Astral, and Ethereal Planes. They are generally \"homebodies\" favoring their native Plane of Earth, but some maintain relationships with efreet on the Plane of Fire. In addition to traveling of their own volition, dao may be summoned to the Prime Material Plane through magical abilities or items.</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Habitat/Society:</b> The dao's native land is the Elemental Plane of Earth, a realm of solid matter broken by pockets of air, water, and fire. The dao have tamed, worked, and settled these pockets for their own use. The pockets and caverns twist back on themselves like intricate knots, and are called <i>mazeworks</i>. A typical mazework comprises 4 to 40 (4d10) <a href=\"/appendix/genie\">dao</a>, and 8 to 80 (8d10) slaves. Typical slaves include elemental beings such as <a href=\"/appendix/xorn\">xorn</a>, captives from the Prime Material Plane (especially races accustomed to a life underground), and hapless human adventurers. Xorn and other creatures who can move through stone serve the dao as scouts, determining the location of future diggings.</p><p class=\"f\">A standard dao mazework is ruled by an ataman (or hetman) who acts on the advice of a seneschal. Both are either dao of maximum hit points or a <a href=\"/appendix/geninoda\">noble dao</a>. One to six nobles or dao of maximum hit points make up the ruler's immediate court. While the ataman's loyalty may be in question, the seneschal's is not, since the latter is appointed by the Great Khan of the dao. Seneschals are responsible for collecting taxes and slave levies from the smaller mazeworks, to be turned over to the Great Khan for his own use. Often an ataman will declare his independence, and seek to break away or cheat the Great Khan of his due. As a result, punitive expeditions against independent kingdoms are common in the Elemental Plane of Earth.</p><p class=\"f\">The Great Khan rules his subjects from a cavern complex called the Sevenfold Mazework. The complex lies at the deep heart of the Great Dismal Delve, which is the largest dao city on the Plane of Earth. Most noble dao, as well as the majority of all dao, can be found in the Delve. It is a huge metropolis, continually bustling with trade in gems, metals, and mortal lives. The city's suqs and bazaars are the most wondrous (and dangerous) on the inner planes.</p><p class=\"f\">Of all genie races, dao are the most industrious. They are continually mining, shaping, and digging new lands-activities that require a steady flow of slaves and materials. Their markets are filled with sharp dealers, new wonders, precious metals, and lively slave-auctions. (While dao fear losing their own freedom, and despise those who would imprison them, they see nothing wrong with depriving others of their freedom.) These genies are diligent, hard-working, and driven to complete their tasks to the best of their abilities.</p><p class=\"f\">Dao industriousness is what moves them to invade the Prime Material Plane, where they hope to open new markets and new supply lines for their insatiable empires. In the Prime Material Plane, dao are normally found alone, scouting for resources or dealing with local merchants. They prefer the mountainous terrain familiar to their race, but can also be found in deserts and jungles. They are uneasy in mortal cities, but will go there if trade is good.</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Ecology:</b> Dao do not need to eat or drink. They can fast for years without significant detriment to their abilities. They also can slow their breathing to a point that enables them to remain buried beneath tons of debris and be unaffected. (They are still vulnerable to poisons and air-based attacks, however.) Despite such powerful constitutions, dao enjoy the sensations of life, and often partake in hedonistic revelry. For example, dao believe that powdered gems, gold dust, and gold leaf heighten the experience of eating -  devouring them as mortals might use a precious spice.</p><p class=\"f\">Dao take pride in a thing well-made and a plot well-planned. Mortal agents sometimes employ dao to build fortifications and palaces, for their engineering skills are second to none. When constructing something, the malicious nature of the dao is submerged in the industry of the work.</p><p class=\"f\">In the Prime Material Plane, far to the north of the enlightened world, the industriousness of dao has been harnessed by evil <a href=\"/appendix/yakman\">yakmen</a>. Dao are incapable of attacking these creatures, and are condemned to serve them. Among the genies, dao are on speaking and trading terms with the efreet, but they have nothing but scorn and hatred for jann, djinn, and marids. Other races native to the Elemental Plane of Earth avoid the dao, for these evil genies are always seeking new slaves.</p><p class=\"f\">Male or female, dao are powerfully muscled individuals. Their polished skin is the color of earth, sand, or granite, and their finger- and toenails are made of a durable but lustrous metal. The fingers themselves are wide and pudgy, even if the dao assume other forms. Both sexes are bald and free of body hair. Males do have facial hair, worn in mustaches and angular beards. All dao enjoy adorning themselves with jewelry, such as earrings, bracers, chokers, nose rings and studs, ankle bracelets, rings, and bells. Many don shirts of lamellar plates.</p>\n","images":["<img src=\"grf/xx.gif\" width=\"150\" height=\"75\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Advanced Dungeons & Dragons 2nd Edition\" title=\"Al-Qadim (Forgotten Realms)\" align=\"right\">","<img src=\"img/genizkda.gif\" alt=\"Genie of Zakhara, Dao\" title=\"Genie of Zakhara, Dao\" border=\"0\" width=\"300\" height=\"360\" style=\"text-align:right;\" align=\"right\">","<img src=\"/img/spc/genizkda1.gif\" width=\"300\" height=\"360\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Genie of Zakhara, Dao\" title=\"Genie of Zakhara, Dao\" style=\"float:left;\"/>","<img src=\"grf/tsr_sm.png\" width=\"56\" height=\"59\" border=\"0\" alt=\"TSR\">"],"setting":"Al-Qadim (Forgotten Realms)","statblock":{"Genie of Zakhara, Dao":{"Activity Cycle":"Day","Alignment":"Neutral evil","Armor Class":"3","Climate/Terrain":"Earth, mountains","Damage/Attack":"3-18 (3d6)","Diet":"Omnivore","Frequency":"Rare","Hit Dice":"8+3","Intelligence":"Low to very (5-12)","Magic Resistance":"Nil","Morale":"Champion (15-16)","Movement":"9, Fl 15 (B), Br 6","No. Appearing":"1","No. of Attacks":"1","Organization":"Khanate","Size":"L (8-11 ft. tall)","Special Attacks":"See below","Special Defenses":"Earth resistance; see below","THAC0":"13","Treasure":"F","XP Value":"6,000"}},"title":"Genie of Zakhara, Dao"},"sources":["1077"],"statblock_names":[],"title":"Genie of Zakhara, Dao","prev_key":"geninoma","next_key":"genizkdj","monster_path":"/appendix/genizkda"}},"staticQueryHashes":[],"slicesMap":{}}
