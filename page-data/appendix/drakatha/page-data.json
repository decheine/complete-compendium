While the powers listed above are the most common, some aarakocra have different or additional powers.</p><p class=\"f\">A race of intelligent, birdlike creatures living in the deepest deserts of Athas, the rare Athasian <a href=\"/appendix/aarakocr\">aarakocra</a> spends its time soaring on thermals in search of food.</p><p>The aarakocra is 7 to 8 feet tall with a wingspan of 20 feet or more. Because of its large wingspan, an aarakocra can carry as much as 75% of its own body weight and still fly easily. An aarakocra can fly a short distance carrying a burden equaling 125% of its own body weight. The average body weight of a full grown male is 100 pounds and a female is 85 pounds.</p><p>Each wing has a &ldquo;hand&rdquo; at its midpoint, consisting of three fingers and an opposable thumb. The fourth finger forms the rigid leading edge of the wing. In flight the hands cannot be used, but on the ground the aarakocra can use its hands almost as a human would. The aarakocra's body is protected by a thin bony plate on the chest, much like a solid rib cage. Talons on its legs can be used as claws and can be retracted to reveal a second set of hands, also with three fingers and an opposable thumb. Except for the chest plate, the entire skeleton is hollow and extremely fragile.</p><p>From a distance, the Athasian aarakocra resembles a huge <a href=\"/appendix/bird\">vulture</a>. Its black eyes, set in the front of the head, provide excellent vision over a long range. The plumage is generally black with a white collar for adult males and black or brown with a smaller white collar for females. Adolescents are a mixture of brown and black. The beak is large and covers most of the head. Plumage begins at the crown of the head and is darker near the head, except for the collar. Athasian aarakocra speak their own language and the languages of vultures and other large birds. Some speak the common tongue (5% to 10% chance depending on how deep in the wastelands a tribe lives).</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Combat:</b> Aarakocra can fight in the air or on the ground. They prefer aerial combat since their bones are too fragile to withstand a solid blow from a human-sized opponent. In combat against creatures on the ground, they prefer to fly over their victim and drop weighted nets. Some aarakocra use darts to harass ground-based opponents.</p><p>If their opponents can fly, the aarakocra generally forgo the use of the net, although large groups sometimes use nets on flying creatures. Normally, aarakocra attack flying creatures with long spears, diving from above and allowing the momentum to carry the spear through the target. Such an attack doubles the damage if the aarakocra have been able to dive at least 50 feet. Only the very largest aarakocra can carry more than one of these spears, they can attack with both at once with no penalty, causing double damage on each strike. All diving attacks are made at +4 and should be treated as a charge attack. All other penalties and restrictions of charge attacks apply.</p><p>The effect of the aarakocra's nets depends on if the opponent is flying at the time it becomes entangled. Creatures on the ground that are hit by a net are entangled and unable to participate in any combat until they make a successful Strength check to get free of the net. Flying creatures hit by a net can no longer fly and immediately begin falling. If they cannot escape the net or use some magical means to arrest the fall, normal falling damage applies.</p><p>Unless victims are entangled in nets, aarakocra are cautious in ground combat. If the aarakocra outnumber their opponents they advance in a straight line and thrust with their spears. If outnumbered, or the opponents are particularly tough, the aarakocra withdraw. Victims entangled in nets are killed or incapacitated for use as food or ransom.</p><p>Athasian aarakocra are mindful of their physical limitations as well as their comparatively low psionic abilities. They do not normally initiate psionic combat. At the first sign of psionic powers from any of their victims, however, all aarakocra that have some ability will use whatever attack and defense modes they can in an attempt to destroy the threat. Large groups of is or more aarakocra may initiate psionic combat if their leaders feel they can win quickly and avoid physical combat.</p><p>In desperation, an aarakocra can attempt to bite an opponent in combat. Because of the unwieldiness of its beak, the aarakocra has a THAC0 of 18 if attacking with this appendage. Further, the birdman causes only 1d2 points of damage with the beak.</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Habitat/Society:</b> Athasian aarakocra live in tribes with 6-20 (2d8+4) members, depending on the prestige of the leader. The largest tribe ever recorded had 50 members. The tribal hunting territory depends on the size of the tribe, usually about 500 square miles for a tribe of 10 members. There are no rigid boundaries between tribes and border disputes are not uncommon.</p><p>Alignments of tribe members are similar to the alignment of the leader. A tribe that has a leader who is neutral good may have neutral good, chaotic good, lawful good, and true neutral members. A predominantly evil tribe does not recognize boundaries with other tribes and treats other tribes as inferior beings to be eliminated.</p><p>Athasian aarakocra aren't happy in enclosed spaces, but they they take refuge in a cave or building if necessary.</p><p>Nonevil tribes live in rocky aeries in the highest peaks they can find. Evil tribes are normally nomadic and use an aerie made by another tribe if they need to remain in an area for a long time, even if they have to evict the tribe that made the nest.</p><p>Aarakocra aren't friendly toward intruders in their territory, especially caravans. They try to extract a toll from the caravan for passage through the desert. Good-aligned tribes allow unhindered passage of caravans that pay a tribute. If someone refuses to pay the tribute, the aarakocra try to capture scouts or outriders from the party and hold them until an even larger tribute is paid. The payment may be either livestock or shiny objects. Aarakocra are smart enough not to be taken in by glass baubles instead of gems, although they cannot tell the difference between the more common gems and the rare ones.</p><p>Evil tribes ask for tribute and often attack a caravan whether it pays or not. Aarakocra always demand shiny objects such as stones. These tribes find humans and demihumans to be quite tasty and prefer them to other food.</p><p>Good-aligned tribes of aarakocra sometimes return a lost traveler to the edge of the desert after first removing any valuables the traveler may be carrying. On very rare occasions a tribe might return a lost group of travelers to the more frequently traveled parts of the desert, again after first taking any valuables as payment.</p><p>The oldest male is the leader of the tribal hunting party and has 4+4 Hit Dice. The oldest female is in charge of the tribal aerie and has 3+3 HD. In tribes that have more than 15 members, the next oldest aarakocra serves as shaman and has 3+3 HD; the shaman completes the triumvirate necessary for proper worship and the summoning of elementals. (Interestingly, no magic-using aarakocra has ever been recorded.) Tribes without a shaman cannot summon <a href=\"/appendix/element1\">air elementals</a>, which is an important part of aarakocra culture.</p><p>The shaman is the leader of the daily sun worship. Aarakocra worship the sun because it provides them with the thermals they need to soar in search of food. The shaman also leads the mystic rituals used to summon an air elemental. Summoning an air elemental is usually done only in preparation for the tribe's most sacred ceremony, the hunt. Small tribes must band together for this ceremony to allow the triumvirate to be formed.</p><p>The ceremony to summon an air elemental must be conducted at dawn and requires the oldest male and female to emit a highpitched keening whistle. The shaman conducts an intricate dance around them, simultaneously chanting an ancient summoning mantra.</p><p>The hunt is the final part of the initiation of adolescent aarakocra to adulthood and often takes the tribe far from their normal teritory. The target is always a <a href=\"/appendix/drakalsi\">silt drake</a>. The hunt is the only time the females leave the relative safety of the nest. Even an evil tribe will not interfere with a tribe on a hunt. An air elemental is often summoned to help find the drake, but never takes part in the actual combat. Although the adult members of the tribe take part in the initial phases of the combat, it is the initiates who deliver the final, killing blows to me drake. Scars from the hunt are considered a mark of pride among all aarakocra.</p><p>The females spend about eight months of the year incubating their eggs. Athasian aarakocra mate for life and a pair normally produces as many as 10 offspring. A female lays one egg a year. Constant incubation is not required because of the high daytime temperatures, so the females can maintain the nest and keep the tribe's treasure in order.</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Ecology:</b> Athasian aarakocra are high on the food chain and have no natural enemies other than <a href=\"/appendix/drakatha\">drakes</a>. Unless evil, aarakocra leave their own territory only to hunt the silt drake and return as soon as possible when the hunt is over. (Evil aarakocra attack others, as noted above.) Aarakocra eggs and hatchlings are sought after by wealthy land owners who wish to use the creatures as scouts and sentries. An egg can bring as much as 10 cp in Tyr's marketplace. Tribes that have had eggs or hatchlings stolen have long memories and sometimes take revenge against the thief at a later date. Captive aarakocra join any tribe they come in contact with.</p><p>Athasian aarakocra have a natural life span of 21-30 years.</p><p></p><br clear=\"all\" style=\"clear:both; height:0;\">\r\n","images":["<img src=\"grf/ds.gif\" width=\"150\" height=\"75\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Dark Sun\" title=\"Dark Sun\" align=\"right\">","<img src=\"img/aarakath.gif\" alt=\"Aarakocra (Athas)\" title=\"Aarakocra (Athas)\" border=\"0\" width=\"300\" height=\"360\" style=\"text-align:right;\" align=\"right\">","<img src=\"grf/add2_01.gif\" width=\"200\" height=\"56\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Advanced Dungeons & Dragons 2nd Edition\">"],"setting":"Dark Sun","statblock":{"Aarakocra (Athas)":{"Activity Cycle":"Day","Alignment":"Any","Armor Class":"7","Climate/Terrain":"Deep desert","Damage/Attack":"1d3/1d3 or by weapon","Diet":"Carnivore","Frequency":"Rare","Hit Dice":"2+2","Intelligence":"Average (8-10)","Magic Resistance":"Nil","Morale":"Steady (11)","Movement":"6, Fl 36 (C)","No. Appearing":"1d10","No. of Attacks":"2","Organization":"Tribal","Size":"M (20'+ wingspan)","Special Attacks":"Nil","Special Defenses":"Nil","THAC0":"17","Treasure":"Varies","XP Value":"65"}},"title":"Aarakocra (Athas)"},"sources":["2433"],"statblock_names":[],"title":"Aarakocra (Athas)","prev_key":"zygraat","next_key":"aarakocr","monster_path":"/appendix/aarakath"}}},"pageContext":{"monster_key":"drakatha","monster_data":{"TSR":null,"fullBody":"  <p class=\"f\">Drakes are gargantuan, reptilian monsters that use Athas as their personal hunting grounds. Drakes comprise a very powerful, nonintelligent group of creatures on Athas. However, they are not stupid. If natural instinct, cunning, and ferocity were measurable, drakes would surpass many other creatures. They are feared for their size, speed, and devastating abilities in combat, the latter due, in great part, to their very powerful psionics. Many on Athas consider the drakes to be second only to the <a href=\"/appendix/dragotyr\">Dragon</a> in this category.</p><p>Drakes are not natives of Athas. The first drakes used tremendous psionic powers to travel from their home elemental planes to Athas, where they found a world much to their liking. Many generations of drakes have been born on Athas since that time.</p><p>Humans and humanoids comprise the mainstay of their diet. They will eat <a href=\"/appendix/animdoa1\">inix</a> and <a href=\"/appendix/animdoa1\">mekillots</a> when available and erdlu if necessary. Drakes prefer the taste of carnivore flesh over any other type of meat.</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Combat:</b> Although powerful psionicists, most drakes prefer physical combat. All drakes have claw/claw/bite/tail lash attacks, psionics, and a breath weapon (useable once per day). <a href=\"/appendix/drakaair\">Air drakes</a> also have a wing-buffet attack. In combat drakes tend to focus all of their attacks on a single target, killing it and then moving on to the next.</p><p>Drakes use their claws for locomotion and digging hovels. A drake must use its claws regularly or the nails will grow too long and curve inward into the footpads. Drakes do not always kill their food before eating it. Damage caused by the claw attacks varies by drake type.</p><p>Drakes do not hesitate to use their bite attack especially if the strike could be the killing blow. If a successful bite attack roll exceeds the required number by four or more, drakes will clamp their victims within their jaws and then shake their heads from side to side with all of their might. This action doubles the damage caused by the first attack. As long as the victim remains alive, the drake will continue this action, scoring automatic damage each round equal to the original bite damage (before being doubled). If possible, the drake will swallow the dead or injured victim and move on to another treat. Digestive acids begin their work on the following round causing 1d20 damage per round (with no saving throw allowed) until the victim has been digested. Personal items must make saving throws versus acid or also be destroyed.</p><p>The tail attack of the drake can be the most devastating. Lashing its tail in a side-to-side sweeping motion, the drake can hit objects that it cannot even see at no penalty. (The tail lash is considered an area attack and not an attack against an unseen target, hence no -4 penalty.) Any creature struck by the tail lash regardless of size must save versus petrification or be stunned for 1d6 rounds. The damage caused by the tail lash varies among the types of drakes.</p><p>All drake have the ability to make an elemental attack, which takes different forms according to the drake. Fortunately drakes can only use this terrible ability once every 15 days, as it takes that long for them to recreate the elemental effect (see below). The effect varies between the different drakes, but the result is always devastating.</p><p>The greatest power of the drake is its innate psionics. Drakes possess various psionic powers that always manifest themselves with no psionic strength point loss affecting any of the drakes' other psionic abilities. These natural psionic powers are all devotions and are the same for all the varieties of drakes. They are:</p><ul><li><b>Clairsentience</b> - <i>Devotions:</i> danger sense, radial navigation, spirit sense.</li><li><b>Psychokinesis</b> - <i>Devotions:</i> inertial barrier.</li><li><b>Psychometabolism</b> - <i>Devotions:</i> body control, cell adjustment, heightened senses.</li></ul><p><img src=\"img/drakaear.gif\" width=\"300\" height=\"360\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Drake (Athas), Earth\" title=\"Drake (Athas), Earth\" style=\"float:left;\">Note that the drakes' <i>body control</i> power, which allows them to adapt to a single, pre-selected, hostile environment, is automatically linked to their elemental identification, be it air, earth, fire, or water.</p><p>The innate abilities function as described in <i>The Complete Psionics Handbook</i>. These abilities, coupled with each drake's individual psionic powers, make them deadly foes.</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Habitat/Society:</b> Drakes are mysterious creatures. Few people believe they really exist. Even fewer have ever seen one, and very few of those have lived to tell about the experience. Hunting drakes is a challenge for the foolhardy or suicidal in Athasian society. However, on rare occasions drakes do succumb to old age or illness and pass on. No one knows how long a drake lives, and few of them have ever been killed.</p><p>A drake's habitat is dictated by his home elemental plane. <a href=\"/appendix/drakaear\">Earth drakes</a>, for instance, can find a home virtually anywhere on Athas, but prefer rocky areas and mountains to the open sands. Air drakes, as well, know few limitations, and can ride the winds from the Ringing Mountains to the Sea of Silt and beyond ~ their lairs are usually high in the mountains. <a href=\"/appendix/drakafir\">Fire drakes</a> can live in the arid sands, but are always on the lookout for volcanoes or hot springs - they'll even set a forest on fire to bask in the comfort of the flames for a time. <a href=\"/appendix/drakawat\">Water drakes</a> are the most limited on Athas, preferring ponds and other bodies of water to make their homes.</p><p>The drake's actual lair is never actually an open space - there are few open spaces back on their home planes. Drakes are more comfortable when surrounded, literally, with their home element. An earth drake, for instance, does not live in a vast cavern, as one might think, but instead in a very cramped, tight space in which he barely fits - and he's right at home. Consequently, drake lairs are more difficult to penetrate than the lairs of other large creatures.</p><p>Several of those who have seen drakes have mistaken them for the dragon itself. Rumors about multiple <a href=\"/appendix/dragatha\">dragons</a> are rampant through Athas - that there may be several true dragons - but these are usually dismissed. Several so-called additional dragon sightings have been discovered to be drake sightings instead.</p><p><img src=\"img/drakawat.gif\" width=\"300\" height=\"360\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Drake (Athas), Water\" title=\"Drake (Athas), Water\" style=\"float:right\">Other natives of the drake's elemental plane tend to look down on them as deserters or creatures who abandoned the pure elements for this lesser plane. Encounters between drakes and other elemental beings are always tense, often unpleasant, and sometimes violent. Drakes never return to their native planes. Most, in fact, have never been there, being the descendants of drakes who immigrated to the prime material plane centuries ago. Elementals and drakes from the same plane almost always come to blows when they meet on the prime material plane. Oddly, contact between elemental beings from different planes is perfectly normal with none of the aforementioned animosity.</p><p>At their highest levels, psionicists can become powerful beast masters, and among their favorite psionic beasts are drakes. Details on this relationship are presented in the Dragon Kings hardbound.</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Ecology:</b> The hide of a drake can fetch an enormous price on the trading market. It can also result in a death penalty. The hides, teeth, claws, and blood are of such value that some sorcerer-kings forbid their sale. They have instructed templars to confiscate any such items that appear in the market in the name of their sorcerer-king. Because drakes are so rare it is easy for templars to claim the item was stolen from the sorcerer-king and have the seller put to death. <a href=\"/appendix/elfathas\">Elves</a>, of course, defy these edicts at every turn, and make a fair profit selling drake materials while just one step ahead of their templar pursuers.</p><p>The hide makes excellent armor. Once crafted into leather armor it attains the leather armor defense value minus the drake's original negative armor class score (i.e., leather is AC 8; if made from the hide of an air drake whose AC was -2, then the air drake leather armor would have a defense value of Armor Class 6 (8 -2 = 6)). The teeth and claws make excellent weapons; although not magical, they are considered +2 because of the bone's strength and sharpness. The blood of the beast is also valuable as it is used in certain alchemical solutions.</p><p>Beyond these truly useful items, folklore holds that just about any portion of a drake's carcass holds a great deal of magical luck. Disreputable elven hawkers push a variety of lucky tokens fashioned from drake parts, but only under the table in a special place, out of the templars' sights. Most are hoaxes, but even those that are real have no real magical value. Despite this, drake amulets draw large prices from the ever hopeful of Athas.</p><p>Drakes mate when the urge strikes them and not on a regular cycle. The male is then driven away and the female patiently waits. One, at most two, eggs will be laid, which hatch over a six-month period. The young drakes are almost always hungry and need constant care. They will grow from two to twenty feet in the first year, then 5' each year thereafter until they reach their full size.</p><p>Drakes are coveters and collectors. What and why they collect is known only to the individual drake. An earth drake may keep precious metals or covet thousands of small stones that are exactly the same size. An air drake may covet certain peaks (considering them property to collect) or like objects that float when they catch the breeze. A water drake might collect shiny things or things that hold water. No one knows what a fire drake collects, since they will destroy their &ldquo;collection&rdquo; rather than have a stranger view what it contains. An unarmed man confronting a drake still has one last chance - that is to offer the drake something that it would like to add to its collection. A grateful drake is likely to let someone go free who presents a bit of tribute.</p><p></p><br clear=\"all\" style=\"clear:both; height:0;\">\r\n","images":["<img src=\"grf/ds.gif\" width=\"150\" height=\"75\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Dark Sun\" title=\"Dark Sun\" align=\"right\">","<img src=\"img/drakatha.gif\" alt=\"Drake (Athas), General Information\" title=\"Drake (Athas), General Information\" border=\"0\" width=\"300\" height=\"360\" style=\"text-align:right;\" align=\"right\">","<img src=\"img/drakaear.gif\" width=\"300\" height=\"360\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Drake (Athas), Earth\" title=\"Drake (Athas), Earth\" style=\"float:left;\">","<img src=\"img/drakawat.gif\" width=\"300\" height=\"360\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Drake (Athas), Water\" title=\"Drake (Athas), Water\" style=\"float:right\">","<img src=\"grf/add2_01.gif\" width=\"200\" height=\"56\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Advanced Dungeons & Dragons 2nd Edition\">"],"setting":"Dark Sun","title":"Drake (Athas), General Information"},"sources":null,"statblock_names":[],"title":"Drake (Athas), General Information","prev_key":"drakalsu","next_key":"drakawat","monster_path":"/appendix/drakatha"}},"staticQueryHashes":[],"slicesMap":{}}
