While the powers listed above are the most common, some aarakocra have different or additional powers.</p><p class=\"f\">A race of intelligent, birdlike creatures living in the deepest deserts of Athas, the rare Athasian <a href=\"/appendix/aarakocr\">aarakocra</a> spends its time soaring on thermals in search of food.</p><p>The aarakocra is 7 to 8 feet tall with a wingspan of 20 feet or more. Because of its large wingspan, an aarakocra can carry as much as 75% of its own body weight and still fly easily. An aarakocra can fly a short distance carrying a burden equaling 125% of its own body weight. The average body weight of a full grown male is 100 pounds and a female is 85 pounds.</p><p>Each wing has a &ldquo;hand&rdquo; at its midpoint, consisting of three fingers and an opposable thumb. The fourth finger forms the rigid leading edge of the wing. In flight the hands cannot be used, but on the ground the aarakocra can use its hands almost as a human would. The aarakocra's body is protected by a thin bony plate on the chest, much like a solid rib cage. Talons on its legs can be used as claws and can be retracted to reveal a second set of hands, also with three fingers and an opposable thumb. Except for the chest plate, the entire skeleton is hollow and extremely fragile.</p><p>From a distance, the Athasian aarakocra resembles a huge <a href=\"/appendix/bird\">vulture</a>. Its black eyes, set in the front of the head, provide excellent vision over a long range. The plumage is generally black with a white collar for adult males and black or brown with a smaller white collar for females. Adolescents are a mixture of brown and black. The beak is large and covers most of the head. Plumage begins at the crown of the head and is darker near the head, except for the collar. Athasian aarakocra speak their own language and the languages of vultures and other large birds. Some speak the common tongue (5% to 10% chance depending on how deep in the wastelands a tribe lives).</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Combat:</b> Aarakocra can fight in the air or on the ground. They prefer aerial combat since their bones are too fragile to withstand a solid blow from a human-sized opponent. In combat against creatures on the ground, they prefer to fly over their victim and drop weighted nets. Some aarakocra use darts to harass ground-based opponents.</p><p>If their opponents can fly, the aarakocra generally forgo the use of the net, although large groups sometimes use nets on flying creatures. Normally, aarakocra attack flying creatures with long spears, diving from above and allowing the momentum to carry the spear through the target. Such an attack doubles the damage if the aarakocra have been able to dive at least 50 feet. Only the very largest aarakocra can carry more than one of these spears, they can attack with both at once with no penalty, causing double damage on each strike. All diving attacks are made at +4 and should be treated as a charge attack. All other penalties and restrictions of charge attacks apply.</p><p>The effect of the aarakocra's nets depends on if the opponent is flying at the time it becomes entangled. Creatures on the ground that are hit by a net are entangled and unable to participate in any combat until they make a successful Strength check to get free of the net. Flying creatures hit by a net can no longer fly and immediately begin falling. If they cannot escape the net or use some magical means to arrest the fall, normal falling damage applies.</p><p>Unless victims are entangled in nets, aarakocra are cautious in ground combat. If the aarakocra outnumber their opponents they advance in a straight line and thrust with their spears. If outnumbered, or the opponents are particularly tough, the aarakocra withdraw. Victims entangled in nets are killed or incapacitated for use as food or ransom.</p><p>Athasian aarakocra are mindful of their physical limitations as well as their comparatively low psionic abilities. They do not normally initiate psionic combat. At the first sign of psionic powers from any of their victims, however, all aarakocra that have some ability will use whatever attack and defense modes they can in an attempt to destroy the threat. Large groups of is or more aarakocra may initiate psionic combat if their leaders feel they can win quickly and avoid physical combat.</p><p>In desperation, an aarakocra can attempt to bite an opponent in combat. Because of the unwieldiness of its beak, the aarakocra has a THAC0 of 18 if attacking with this appendage. Further, the birdman causes only 1d2 points of damage with the beak.</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Habitat/Society:</b> Athasian aarakocra live in tribes with 6-20 (2d8+4) members, depending on the prestige of the leader. The largest tribe ever recorded had 50 members. The tribal hunting territory depends on the size of the tribe, usually about 500 square miles for a tribe of 10 members. There are no rigid boundaries between tribes and border disputes are not uncommon.</p><p>Alignments of tribe members are similar to the alignment of the leader. A tribe that has a leader who is neutral good may have neutral good, chaotic good, lawful good, and true neutral members. A predominantly evil tribe does not recognize boundaries with other tribes and treats other tribes as inferior beings to be eliminated.</p><p>Athasian aarakocra aren't happy in enclosed spaces, but they they take refuge in a cave or building if necessary.</p><p>Nonevil tribes live in rocky aeries in the highest peaks they can find. Evil tribes are normally nomadic and use an aerie made by another tribe if they need to remain in an area for a long time, even if they have to evict the tribe that made the nest.</p><p>Aarakocra aren't friendly toward intruders in their territory, especially caravans. They try to extract a toll from the caravan for passage through the desert. Good-aligned tribes allow unhindered passage of caravans that pay a tribute. If someone refuses to pay the tribute, the aarakocra try to capture scouts or outriders from the party and hold them until an even larger tribute is paid. The payment may be either livestock or shiny objects. Aarakocra are smart enough not to be taken in by glass baubles instead of gems, although they cannot tell the difference between the more common gems and the rare ones.</p><p>Evil tribes ask for tribute and often attack a caravan whether it pays or not. Aarakocra always demand shiny objects such as stones. These tribes find humans and demihumans to be quite tasty and prefer them to other food.</p><p>Good-aligned tribes of aarakocra sometimes return a lost traveler to the edge of the desert after first removing any valuables the traveler may be carrying. On very rare occasions a tribe might return a lost group of travelers to the more frequently traveled parts of the desert, again after first taking any valuables as payment.</p><p>The oldest male is the leader of the tribal hunting party and has 4+4 Hit Dice. The oldest female is in charge of the tribal aerie and has 3+3 HD. In tribes that have more than 15 members, the next oldest aarakocra serves as shaman and has 3+3 HD; the shaman completes the triumvirate necessary for proper worship and the summoning of elementals. (Interestingly, no magic-using aarakocra has ever been recorded.) Tribes without a shaman cannot summon <a href=\"/appendix/element1\">air elementals</a>, which is an important part of aarakocra culture.</p><p>The shaman is the leader of the daily sun worship. Aarakocra worship the sun because it provides them with the thermals they need to soar in search of food. The shaman also leads the mystic rituals used to summon an air elemental. Summoning an air elemental is usually done only in preparation for the tribe's most sacred ceremony, the hunt. Small tribes must band together for this ceremony to allow the triumvirate to be formed.</p><p>The ceremony to summon an air elemental must be conducted at dawn and requires the oldest male and female to emit a highpitched keening whistle. The shaman conducts an intricate dance around them, simultaneously chanting an ancient summoning mantra.</p><p>The hunt is the final part of the initiation of adolescent aarakocra to adulthood and often takes the tribe far from their normal teritory. The target is always a <a href=\"/appendix/drakalsi\">silt drake</a>. The hunt is the only time the females leave the relative safety of the nest. Even an evil tribe will not interfere with a tribe on a hunt. An air elemental is often summoned to help find the drake, but never takes part in the actual combat. Although the adult members of the tribe take part in the initial phases of the combat, it is the initiates who deliver the final, killing blows to me drake. Scars from the hunt are considered a mark of pride among all aarakocra.</p><p>The females spend about eight months of the year incubating their eggs. Athasian aarakocra mate for life and a pair normally produces as many as 10 offspring. A female lays one egg a year. Constant incubation is not required because of the high daytime temperatures, so the females can maintain the nest and keep the tribe's treasure in order.</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Ecology:</b> Athasian aarakocra are high on the food chain and have no natural enemies other than <a href=\"/appendix/drakatha\">drakes</a>. Unless evil, aarakocra leave their own territory only to hunt the silt drake and return as soon as possible when the hunt is over. (Evil aarakocra attack others, as noted above.) Aarakocra eggs and hatchlings are sought after by wealthy land owners who wish to use the creatures as scouts and sentries. An egg can bring as much as 10 cp in Tyr's marketplace. Tribes that have had eggs or hatchlings stolen have long memories and sometimes take revenge against the thief at a later date. Captive aarakocra join any tribe they come in contact with.</p><p>Athasian aarakocra have a natural life span of 21-30 years.</p><p></p><br clear=\"all\" style=\"clear:both; height:0;\">\r\n","images":["<img src=\"grf/ds.gif\" width=\"150\" height=\"75\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Dark Sun\" title=\"Dark Sun\" align=\"right\">","<img src=\"img/aarakath.gif\" alt=\"Aarakocra (Athas)\" title=\"Aarakocra (Athas)\" border=\"0\" width=\"300\" height=\"360\" style=\"text-align:right;\" align=\"right\">","<img src=\"grf/add2_01.gif\" width=\"200\" height=\"56\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Advanced Dungeons & Dragons 2nd Edition\">"],"setting":"Dark Sun","statblock":{"Aarakocra (Athas)":{"Activity Cycle":"Day","Alignment":"Any","Armor Class":"7","Climate/Terrain":"Deep desert","Damage/Attack":"1d3/1d3 or by weapon","Diet":"Carnivore","Frequency":"Rare","Hit Dice":"2+2","Intelligence":"Average (8-10)","Magic Resistance":"Nil","Morale":"Steady (11)","Movement":"6, Fl 36 (C)","No. Appearing":"1d10","No. of Attacks":"2","Organization":"Tribal","Size":"M (20'+ wingspan)","Special Attacks":"Nil","Special Defenses":"Nil","THAC0":"17","Treasure":"Varies","XP Value":"65"}},"title":"Aarakocra (Athas)"},"sources":["2433"],"statblock_names":[],"title":"Aarakocra (Athas)","prev_key":"zygraat","next_key":"aarakocr","monster_path":"/appendix/aarakath"}}},"pageContext":{"monster_key":"batdeep","monster_data":{"TSR":["9326"],"fullBody":"  <table cellspacing=\"0\" cellpadding=\"0\"><tr class=\"bk\"><th> </th><th class=\"cn\">Azmyth</th><th class=\"cn\">Night Hunter</th><th class=\"cn\">Sinister</th><th class=\"cn\">Werebat</th></tr><tr><th>Climate/Terrain:</th>  <td>Any temperate/any</td><td>Any temperate/any</td><td>Any/any</td><td>Any/any</td></tr><tr><th>Frequency:</th>        <td>Rare</td><td>Uncommon</td><td>Rare</td><td>Very Rare</td></tr><tr><th>Organization:</th>     <td>Solitary</td><td>Hunting Packs</td><td>Bands</td><td>Solitary</td></tr><tr><th>Activity Cycle:</th>   <td>Any</td><td>Nocturnal/any</td><td>Any</td><td>See below</td></tr><tr><th>Diet:</th>             <td>Omnivore</td><td>Carnivore</td><td>Omnivore</td><td>Any/blood (in bat form)</td></tr><tr><th>Intelligence:</th>     <td>High (13-14)</td><td>Average to high (8-14)</td><td>Average to Exceptional (8-16)</td><td>Varies</td></tr><tr><th>Treasure:</th>         <td>Nil</td><td>M, O, Z (in lair)</td><td>Nil</td><td>All posible</td></tr><tr><th>Alignment:</th>        <td>Chaotic neutral</td><td>Neutral evil</td><td>Lawful neutral</td><td>Varies</td></tr><tr><th>No. Appearing:</th>    <td>1</td><td>1-12 (1-30 in lair)</td><td>1-6</td><td>1 (1-2)</td></tr><tr><th>Armor Class:</th>      <td>2</td><td>6</td><td>3</td><td>7</td></tr><tr><th>Movement:</th>         <td>3, Fl 24 (A)</td><td>2, Fl 18 (A)</td><td>2, Fl 21 (A)</td><td>Vaires (usually 12)/1, Fl 14 (C)</td></tr><tr><th>Hit Dice:</th>         <td>2</td><td>2+2</td><td>4+4</td><td>Varies</td></tr><tr><th>THAC0:</th>            <td>19</td><td>19</td><td>17</td><td>13</td></tr><tr><th>No. of Attacks:</th>   <td>2</td><td>4</td><td>1</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><th>Damage/Attack:</th>    <td>1/1-2</td><td>1-4/1-2/1-2/1-6 or 3-12</td><td>2-5</td><td>1-2</td></tr><tr><th>Special Attacks:</th>  <td>Magic use</td><td>Nil</td><td>Magic use</td><td>Bite effects</td></tr><tr><th>Special Defenses:</th> <td>Magic use</td><td>Nil</td><td>Energy field</td><td>Nil</td></tr><tr><th>Magic Resistance:</th> <td>40%</td><td>Nil</td><td>70%</td><td>Nil</td></tr><tr><th>Size:</th>             <td>S (3' wingspan, length up to 4')</td><td>M (up to 7' wingspan)</td><td>L (9' wingspan)</td><td>M</td></tr><tr><th>Morale:</th>           <td>Elite (14)</td><td>Steady (11)</td><td>Champpion (15-16)</td><td>Varies (12+)</td></tr><tr><th>XP Value:</th>         <td>650</td><td>175</td><td>2000</td><td>Varies (usually 975)</td></tr></table><p>\"Deep bats\" are Faerunian varieties of bat known to be active in both the surface world and the Underdark. The four most important of these species are described in this collective entry.</p><p><b>Azmyth</b></p><p>Azmyths live on flowers, small plants, and insects. They are solitary wanderers, though they do have \"favorite haunts\" to which they often return. They often form partnerships with humanoids for mutual benefit, sometimes forming loyal friendships with such beings. Azmyths have been known to accompany creatures for their entire lives, and then accompany the creatures' offspring. The lifespan and mating details of azmyths are presently unknown. They are not familiars as wizards understand the term; no direct control can be exercised over one except by spells.</p><p>Azymths have crested heads and bearded chins, white, pupilless eyes, and leathery gray, mauve, or emerald green skin. They emit shrill squeaks of alarm or rage, and endearing, liquid chuckles of delight or amusement. They communicate by 60'-range telepathy, and have 90'-range infravision. They can know alignment thrice per day, become invisible (self only, for 6 rounds or less; ending when the azymth makes any successful attack) once per day, and create silence 15' radius, centered on themselves, once a day.</p><p>In combat, azmyths bite (1 hp damage) and stab with their powerful needle-sharp tails (1-2 points). Twice per day, an azmyth can unleash a shocking grasp attack, transmitting 1d8+6 points of electrical damage through any direct physical contact with another creature. This attack can be combined with a physical attack for cumulative damage.</p><p><b>Night Hunter</b></p><p>This species is also known as a \"dragazhar,\" after the adventurer who first domesticated one as a pet, long ago. Nocturnal in the surface Realms, it is active at any time in the gloom of the Underdark. It will eat carrion if it must, but usually hunts small beasts. Desperate dragazhar have been known to attack livestock, drow, or humans</p><p>Night hunter packs (known as \"swoops\") dip down to bite prey (1d4), rake with their wing claws (1-2 each), and slash (1d6) or stab (3d4 damage) with their dexterous, triangular-shaped, razor-sharp tails. They often stalk their prey, flying low and dodging behind hillocks, ridges, trees, or stalagmites, so as to attack from ambush. Night hunters have 180'-range infravision, but rarely surprise opponents, as they emit weird, echoing loon-like screams when excited.</p><p>Night hunter lairs usually contain over thirty creatures (three hunting bands or so). They typically live in doubledended caves, or aboveground in tall trees, in dense woods. Night hunters will not tarry to eat where they feel endangered, so their lairs often contain treasure fallen from prey carried there. Night hunters roost head-downwards when sleeping. They are velvet black in hue, even to their claws, and have violet, orange, or red eyes.</p><p><b>Sinister</b></p><p>hese mysterious, jet-black creatures most closely resemble manta rays - they have no distinct heads and necks, and their powerfully-muscled wings do not show the prominent fingerbones common to most bats. A natural ability of <i>levitation</i> allows them to hang motionless in midair. This unnerving appearance and behavior has earned them their dark name, but sinisters are not evil.</p><p>Aboveground, they prefer to hunt at night, when their 160'-range infravision is most effective. They will eat carrion if no other food is available, and regularly devour flowers and seed-heads of all sorts</p>  <p>Sinisters are both resistant to magic and adept in its use. In addition to their pinpoint-precision levitation, they are at all times, when alive, surrounded by a naturally-generated, 5'-deep energy field akin to a wall of force. This field affords no protection against spells or melee attacks. Missile attacks are stopped utterly; normal missiles are turned away, and such effects as <i>magic missile</i> and <p>Melf's acid arrow</p> are absorbed harmlessly</p><p>In addition, all sinisters can cast one <i>hold monster</i> (as the spell) per day. They usually save this for escaping from creatures more powerful than themselves, but may use it when hunting, if ravenous.</p><p>Curiously, though they are always silent (communicating only with others of their kind, via 20'-range, limited telepathy), sinisters love music; both song and instrumental work. Many a harper or bard making music at a wilderness campfire has found himself surrounded by a silent circle of floating sinisters. Unless they are directly attacked, the sinisters will not molest the bard in any way, but may follow the source of the music, gathering night after night to form a rather daunting audience</p><p>Sinisters are usually encountered in small groups, and are thought to have a long lifespan. Their social habits and numbers are unknown</p><p><b>Werebat</b></p><p>The bite of a werebat can transmit a rare variety of lycanthropy. Humanoids bitten by werebats change to a bat-like form at night-even if deep in the Underdark. Werebats retain the intelligence, alignment, Hit Dice, and ability of speech possessed in their other form. They are fully alert and aware in both forms, and possess acute hearing in either form.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Werebats are heavy and clumsy in flight. Driven by blood-lust, they hunt in bat-form (usually alone). The bite of a werebat's long, hollow fangs punctures and drains blood for 1-2 hp damage, and saliva on the fangs causes weakness with no saving throw. The effects are equal to the wizardly <i>ray of enfeeblement</i> spell, and last 1d4 rounds. In addition, if a <i>cure disease</i> or <i>neutralize poison</i> spell is not cast on the bitten victim within nine turns (application of a slow poison allows the curative spells given above to be successful if cast within 36 turns), the victim has a 80% chance of contracting lycanthropy. The lycanthropy will be of werebat-form only, and its effects will be felt gradually, over the month following the werebat's attack.</p>\r\n<p>Werebats are virtually indistinguishable from nonlycanthropes when in their humanoid form, but once afflicted, most tend to become solitary, and may be dark-eyed, shy, and elusive. They rarely inhabit lairs as bats, returning to the habitations of their other form between excursions in bat form.</p>\r\n<p>Most werebats are desperate, lonely individuals. Many actively seek treasure, hoarding it so that they can purchase a magical cure for their lycanthropy. Silver, holy water, and the like do no special damage to werebats in either form. They are not undead, cannot be turned, and are immune from controlling attempts by bat-influencing magic or vampires.</p>\r\n<img src=\"/img/spc/batdeep.gif\" alt=\"Bats, Deep\" title=\"Bats, Deep (Azmyth, Nighthunter, Sinister, Werebat)\">\r\n<br clear=\"all\" style=\"clear:both; height:0;\">\r\n","images":["<img src=\"grf/fr.gif\" width=\"150\" height=\"75\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Forgotten Realms\" title=\"Forgotten Realms\" align=\"right\">","<img src=\"/img/spc/batdeep.gif\" alt=\"Bats, Deep\" title=\"Bats, Deep (Azmyth, Nighthunter, Sinister, Werebat)\">","<img src=\"grf/tsr_sm.png\" width=\"56\" height=\"59\" border=\"0\" alt=\"TSR\">"],"setting":"Forgotten Realms","statblock":{"Azmyth":{"Activity Cycle":"Any","Alignment":"Chaotic neutral","Armor Class":"2","Climate/Terrain":"Any temperate/any","Damage/Attack":"1/1-2","Diet":"Omnivore","Frequency":"Rare","Hit Dice":"2","Intelligence":"High (13-14)","Magic Resistance":"40%","Morale":"Elite (14)","Movement":"3, Fl 24 (A)","No. Appearing":"1","No. of Attacks":"2","Organization":"Solitary","Size":"S (3' wingspan, length up to 4')","Special Attacks":"Magic use","Special Defenses":"Magic use","THAC0":"19","Treasure":"Nil","XP Value":"650"},"Night Hunter":{"Activity Cycle":"Nocturnal/any","Alignment":"Neutral evil","Armor Class":"6","Climate/Terrain":"Any temperate/any","Damage/Attack":"1-4/1-2/1-2/1-6 or 3-12","Diet":"Carnivore","Frequency":"Uncommon","Hit Dice":"2+2","Intelligence":"Average to high (8-14)","Magic Resistance":"Nil","Morale":"Steady (11)","Movement":"2, Fl 18 (A)","No. Appearing":"1-12 (1-30 in lair)","No. of Attacks":"4","Organization":"Hunting Packs","Size":"M (up to 7' wingspan)","Special Attacks":"Nil","Special Defenses":"Nil","THAC0":"19","Treasure":"M, O, Z (in lair)","XP Value":"175"},"Sinister":{"Activity Cycle":"Any","Alignment":"Lawful neutral","Armor Class":"3","Climate/Terrain":"Any/any","Damage/Attack":"2-5","Diet":"Omnivore","Frequency":"Rare","Hit Dice":"4+4","Intelligence":"Average to Exceptional (8-16)","Magic Resistance":"70%","Morale":"Champpion (15-16)","Movement":"2, Fl 21 (A)","No. Appearing":"1-6","No. of Attacks":"1","Organization":"Bands","Size":"L (9' wingspan)","Special Attacks":"Magic use","Special Defenses":"Energy field","THAC0":"17","Treasure":"Nil","XP Value":"2000"},"Werebat":{"Activity Cycle":"See below","Alignment":"Varies","Armor Class":"7","Climate/Terrain":"Any/any","Damage/Attack":"1-2","Diet":"Any/blood (in bat form)","Frequency":"Very Rare","Hit Dice":"Varies","Intelligence":"Varies","Magic Resistance":"Nil","Morale":"Varies (12+)","Movement":"Vaires (usually 12)/1, Fl 14 (C)","No. Appearing":"1 (1-2)","No. of Attacks":"1","Organization":"Solitary","Size":"M","Special Attacks":"Bite effects","Special Defenses":"Nil","THAC0":"13","Treasure":"All posible","XP Value":"Varies (usually 975)"}},"title":"Bat, Deep"},"sources":["9326"],"statblock_names":[],"title":"Bat, Deep","prev_key":"batbone","next_key":"batracin","monster_path":"/appendix/batdeep"}},"staticQueryHashes":[],"slicesMap":{}}
