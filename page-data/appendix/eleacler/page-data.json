While the powers listed above are the most common, some aarakocra have different or additional powers.</p><p class=\"f\">A race of intelligent, birdlike creatures living in the deepest deserts of Athas, the rare Athasian <a href=\"/appendix/aarakocr\">aarakocra</a> spends its time soaring on thermals in search of food.</p><p>The aarakocra is 7 to 8 feet tall with a wingspan of 20 feet or more. Because of its large wingspan, an aarakocra can carry as much as 75% of its own body weight and still fly easily. An aarakocra can fly a short distance carrying a burden equaling 125% of its own body weight. The average body weight of a full grown male is 100 pounds and a female is 85 pounds.</p><p>Each wing has a &ldquo;hand&rdquo; at its midpoint, consisting of three fingers and an opposable thumb. The fourth finger forms the rigid leading edge of the wing. In flight the hands cannot be used, but on the ground the aarakocra can use its hands almost as a human would. The aarakocra's body is protected by a thin bony plate on the chest, much like a solid rib cage. Talons on its legs can be used as claws and can be retracted to reveal a second set of hands, also with three fingers and an opposable thumb. Except for the chest plate, the entire skeleton is hollow and extremely fragile.</p><p>From a distance, the Athasian aarakocra resembles a huge <a href=\"/appendix/bird\">vulture</a>. Its black eyes, set in the front of the head, provide excellent vision over a long range. The plumage is generally black with a white collar for adult males and black or brown with a smaller white collar for females. Adolescents are a mixture of brown and black. The beak is large and covers most of the head. Plumage begins at the crown of the head and is darker near the head, except for the collar. Athasian aarakocra speak their own language and the languages of vultures and other large birds. Some speak the common tongue (5% to 10% chance depending on how deep in the wastelands a tribe lives).</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Combat:</b> Aarakocra can fight in the air or on the ground. They prefer aerial combat since their bones are too fragile to withstand a solid blow from a human-sized opponent. In combat against creatures on the ground, they prefer to fly over their victim and drop weighted nets. Some aarakocra use darts to harass ground-based opponents.</p><p>If their opponents can fly, the aarakocra generally forgo the use of the net, although large groups sometimes use nets on flying creatures. Normally, aarakocra attack flying creatures with long spears, diving from above and allowing the momentum to carry the spear through the target. Such an attack doubles the damage if the aarakocra have been able to dive at least 50 feet. Only the very largest aarakocra can carry more than one of these spears, they can attack with both at once with no penalty, causing double damage on each strike. All diving attacks are made at +4 and should be treated as a charge attack. All other penalties and restrictions of charge attacks apply.</p><p>The effect of the aarakocra's nets depends on if the opponent is flying at the time it becomes entangled. Creatures on the ground that are hit by a net are entangled and unable to participate in any combat until they make a successful Strength check to get free of the net. Flying creatures hit by a net can no longer fly and immediately begin falling. If they cannot escape the net or use some magical means to arrest the fall, normal falling damage applies.</p><p>Unless victims are entangled in nets, aarakocra are cautious in ground combat. If the aarakocra outnumber their opponents they advance in a straight line and thrust with their spears. If outnumbered, or the opponents are particularly tough, the aarakocra withdraw. Victims entangled in nets are killed or incapacitated for use as food or ransom.</p><p>Athasian aarakocra are mindful of their physical limitations as well as their comparatively low psionic abilities. They do not normally initiate psionic combat. At the first sign of psionic powers from any of their victims, however, all aarakocra that have some ability will use whatever attack and defense modes they can in an attempt to destroy the threat. Large groups of is or more aarakocra may initiate psionic combat if their leaders feel they can win quickly and avoid physical combat.</p><p>In desperation, an aarakocra can attempt to bite an opponent in combat. Because of the unwieldiness of its beak, the aarakocra has a THAC0 of 18 if attacking with this appendage. Further, the birdman causes only 1d2 points of damage with the beak.</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Habitat/Society:</b> Athasian aarakocra live in tribes with 6-20 (2d8+4) members, depending on the prestige of the leader. The largest tribe ever recorded had 50 members. The tribal hunting territory depends on the size of the tribe, usually about 500 square miles for a tribe of 10 members. There are no rigid boundaries between tribes and border disputes are not uncommon.</p><p>Alignments of tribe members are similar to the alignment of the leader. A tribe that has a leader who is neutral good may have neutral good, chaotic good, lawful good, and true neutral members. A predominantly evil tribe does not recognize boundaries with other tribes and treats other tribes as inferior beings to be eliminated.</p><p>Athasian aarakocra aren't happy in enclosed spaces, but they they take refuge in a cave or building if necessary.</p><p>Nonevil tribes live in rocky aeries in the highest peaks they can find. Evil tribes are normally nomadic and use an aerie made by another tribe if they need to remain in an area for a long time, even if they have to evict the tribe that made the nest.</p><p>Aarakocra aren't friendly toward intruders in their territory, especially caravans. They try to extract a toll from the caravan for passage through the desert. Good-aligned tribes allow unhindered passage of caravans that pay a tribute. If someone refuses to pay the tribute, the aarakocra try to capture scouts or outriders from the party and hold them until an even larger tribute is paid. The payment may be either livestock or shiny objects. Aarakocra are smart enough not to be taken in by glass baubles instead of gems, although they cannot tell the difference between the more common gems and the rare ones.</p><p>Evil tribes ask for tribute and often attack a caravan whether it pays or not. Aarakocra always demand shiny objects such as stones. These tribes find humans and demihumans to be quite tasty and prefer them to other food.</p><p>Good-aligned tribes of aarakocra sometimes return a lost traveler to the edge of the desert after first removing any valuables the traveler may be carrying. On very rare occasions a tribe might return a lost group of travelers to the more frequently traveled parts of the desert, again after first taking any valuables as payment.</p><p>The oldest male is the leader of the tribal hunting party and has 4+4 Hit Dice. The oldest female is in charge of the tribal aerie and has 3+3 HD. In tribes that have more than 15 members, the next oldest aarakocra serves as shaman and has 3+3 HD; the shaman completes the triumvirate necessary for proper worship and the summoning of elementals. (Interestingly, no magic-using aarakocra has ever been recorded.) Tribes without a shaman cannot summon <a href=\"/appendix/element1\">air elementals</a>, which is an important part of aarakocra culture.</p><p>The shaman is the leader of the daily sun worship. Aarakocra worship the sun because it provides them with the thermals they need to soar in search of food. The shaman also leads the mystic rituals used to summon an air elemental. Summoning an air elemental is usually done only in preparation for the tribe's most sacred ceremony, the hunt. Small tribes must band together for this ceremony to allow the triumvirate to be formed.</p><p>The ceremony to summon an air elemental must be conducted at dawn and requires the oldest male and female to emit a highpitched keening whistle. The shaman conducts an intricate dance around them, simultaneously chanting an ancient summoning mantra.</p><p>The hunt is the final part of the initiation of adolescent aarakocra to adulthood and often takes the tribe far from their normal teritory. The target is always a <a href=\"/appendix/drakalsi\">silt drake</a>. The hunt is the only time the females leave the relative safety of the nest. Even an evil tribe will not interfere with a tribe on a hunt. An air elemental is often summoned to help find the drake, but never takes part in the actual combat. Although the adult members of the tribe take part in the initial phases of the combat, it is the initiates who deliver the final, killing blows to me drake. Scars from the hunt are considered a mark of pride among all aarakocra.</p><p>The females spend about eight months of the year incubating their eggs. Athasian aarakocra mate for life and a pair normally produces as many as 10 offspring. A female lays one egg a year. Constant incubation is not required because of the high daytime temperatures, so the females can maintain the nest and keep the tribe's treasure in order.</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Ecology:</b> Athasian aarakocra are high on the food chain and have no natural enemies other than <a href=\"/appendix/drakatha\">drakes</a>. Unless evil, aarakocra leave their own territory only to hunt the silt drake and return as soon as possible when the hunt is over. (Evil aarakocra attack others, as noted above.) Aarakocra eggs and hatchlings are sought after by wealthy land owners who wish to use the creatures as scouts and sentries. An egg can bring as much as 10 cp in Tyr's marketplace. Tribes that have had eggs or hatchlings stolen have long memories and sometimes take revenge against the thief at a later date. Captive aarakocra join any tribe they come in contact with.</p><p>Athasian aarakocra have a natural life span of 21-30 years.</p><br clear=\"all\" style=\"clear:both; height:0;\">\r\n","images":["<img src=\"grf/ds.gif\" width=\"150\" height=\"75\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Dark Sun\" title=\"Dark Sun\" align=\"right\">","<img src=\"img/aarakath.gif\" alt=\"Aarakocra (Athas)\" title=\"Aarakocra (Athas)\" border=\"0\" width=\"300\" height=\"360\" style=\"text-align:right;\" align=\"right\">","<img src=\"grf/add2_01.gif\" width=\"200\" height=\"56\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Advanced Dungeons & Dragons 2nd Edition\">"],"setting":"Dark Sun","statblock":{"Aarakocra (Athas)":{"Activity Cycle":"Day","Alignment":"Any","Armor Class":"7","Climate/Terrain":"Deep desert","Damage/Attack":"1d3/1d3 or by weapon","Diet":"Carnivore","Frequency":"Rare","Hit Dice":"2+2","Intelligence":"Average (8-10)","Magic Resistance":"Nil","Morale":"Steady (11)","Movement":"6, Fl 36 (C)","No. Appearing":"1d10","No. of Attacks":"2","Organization":"Tribal","Size":"M (20'+ wingspan)","Special Attacks":"Nil","Special Defenses":"Nil","THAC0":"17","Treasure":"Varies","XP Value":"65"}},"title":"Aarakocra (Athas)"},"sources":["2433"],"statblock_names":[],"title":"Aarakocra (Athas)","prev_key":"zygraat","next_key":"aarakocr","monster_path":"/appendix/aarakath"}}},"pageContext":{"monster_key":"eleacler","monster_data":{"TSR":["2408"],"fullBody":"  <table cellspacing=\"0\" cellpadding=\"0\"><tr><th>Climate/Terrain:</th><td>Any</td></tr><tr><th>Frequency:</th><td>Very rare</td></tr><tr><th>Organization:</th><td>Solitary</td></tr><tr><th>Activity Cycle:</th><td>Any</td></tr><tr><th>Diet:</th><td>Omnivore</td></tr><tr><th>Intelligence:</th><td>Varies</td></tr><tr><th>Treasure:</th><td>Varies</td></tr><tr><th>Alignment:</th><td>Varies</td></tr><tr><th>No. Appearing:</th><td>1</td></tr><tr><th>Armor Class:</th><td>Varies</td></tr><tr><th>Movement:</th><td>Varies</td></tr><tr><th>Hit Dice:</th><td>Varies</td></tr><tr><th>THAC0:</th><td>Varies</td></tr><tr><th>No. of Attacks:</th><td>Varies</td></tr><tr><th>Damage/Attack:</th><td>Varies</td></tr><tr><th>Special Attacks:</th><td>See below</td></tr><tr><th>Special Defenses:</th><td>See below</td></tr><tr><th>Magic Resistance:</th><td>Varies</td></tr><tr><th>Size:</th><td>Varies</td></tr><tr><th>Morale:</th><td>Champion (15-16)</td></tr><tr><th>XP Value:</th><td>Varies</td></tr></table><p class=\"f\">A human dual-classed cleric/psionicist who attains 20th level can choose to pursue a strange and mysterious path that ultimately transforms him into an elemental being of tremendous power. Once the cleric begins this alteration, he can never stop it. Only his death prevents him from becoming an elemental being.</p><p>The elemental form taken is that of the original cleric's focus of worship. Thus, an earth cleric transforms to an earth elemental, an air cleric to an air elemental, etc. The disciplines necessary to specialize in one form of elemental magic prohibits crossover from one elemental form to another. During the transformation process, clerical elementals can switch between human and elemental forms. They do not age in elemental form, but they continue to age in human form. A character who reaches elemental form at 30th level can no longer switch and becomes permanently fixed in elemental form.</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Combat:</b> A cleric of this power in human form retains the abilities that he had prior to his journey along the road to transformation. Thus, he may cast spells and employs psionic powers as a 20th-level cleric. Any magical items or similar abilities that the cleric had are retained as well.</p><p>In elemental form, an individual of this type has the abilities and statistics of either a <a href=\"/appendix/elementa\">standard elemental</a> or a <a href=\"/appendix/eleathas\">greater elemental</a>. In elemental form, the cleric has access to the spells and psionic powers that he had prior to the transformation, but he gains no benefits from any form of magical object. All abilities are now based on the elemental entry appropriate to the character's level as presented on the table at the end of this entry.</p><p>Each time the cleric assumes elemental form, its Hit Dice are rolled anew. As the creature attains greater levels of power, the cleric is entitled to Hit Die re-rolls for certain numbers. For example, an elemental cleric rolls 10 Hit Dice and has rerolls on 1, 2, and 3. Assume that ten 8-sided dice give rolls of 1,2,2,3,4,5,5,6,8, and 8. The four dice that rolled 1,2,2, and 3 are re-rolled until they don't read 1, 2, or 3. If they finally came up 4, 5, 6, and 7, the elemental.s hit points would total 58. See the table at the end of this entry for details.</p><p>Damage taken in either of the cleric's forms is erased after transformation. A cleric who is wounded down to 1 hit point in human form rolls completely new hit points for the elemental form. When he returns to human form, he is completely healed of damage. If the cleric is ever reduced to 0 hp in either form, of course, he dies.</p><p>Normally, an elemental cleric cannot be summoned, though he can be controlled, and that control can be stolen. When summoning spells are employed, other, less-willful elementals from the appropriate plane answer the call. A special spell could be researched to summon a specific elemental, even an elemental cleric, but such magic does not presently exist - the spell would have to be created under the rules governing magical research.</p><p>Devices that can control or govern the actions of elementals can affect clerics. Only magical items can control elemental clerics. Four of the most common means of gaining control over an elemental cleric are the <i>bowl commanding water elementals</i>, <i>brazier commending fire elementals</i>, <i>censer controlling air elementals</i>, and <i>stone of controlling earth elementals</i>. When properly employed, these devices can control an elemental cleric of the appropriate type. The cleric gets a saving throw to ignore the effects. Otherwise, it is controlled, just as described in the Monstrous Compendiums. Once freed, the cleric can attack or ignore the controller as desired.</p><p>A <i>ring of elemental command</i> attuned to the cleric's elemental plane can be used to full effect against the cleric. The affected cleric can be <i>held</i> at a 5' distance or even <i>charmed</i>.</p><p>A <i>scroll of protection - elementals</i> works against elemental clerics just as noted in the DMG.</p><p>As an elemental cleric gains power, it learns the ability to summon lesser and standard elementals. The first of these new powers, <i>conjure lesser elemental</i>, is identical to the spell of the same name presented in the Monstrous Compendium, <i>Dark Sun</i> Appendix. Eventually, the cleric gains the special ability, <i>conjure elemental</i>, identical to the spell of the same name in the <i>Dark Sun</i> Rules Book. The number of times that these powers can be used per day appears on the table at the end of this entry.</p><p>These conjured elementals need not be controlled, nor can their control be stolen from the elemental cleric. They obey the cleric's every thought while on the Prime Material plane.</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Habitat/Society:</b> The most potent of elemental clerics are powerful enough in their own right to be important personages on their elemental plane. Therefore, from time to time, their services are called for on those planes, and they must return there until their business is concluded.</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Ecology:</b> An elemental cleric.s transformation is quite different from that of other advanced beings. The cleric can attain full elemental form even at the lowest levels, though only for a limited time. The time the cleric can spend as an elemental and his relative power increase as he becomes more solidly anchored to his chosen elemental plane. At any given time, the cleric will either be fully elemental or fully human. Since there is no gradual change between the two forms, it is not termed a metamorphosis, but rather a transformation.</p><p>An elemental cleric must assume elemental form exactly once per day. Less-powerful elemental clerics retain human form for all but a short period during a day. More powerful elemental clerics only retain human form for half the day or less. The most powerful clerics abandon human form altogether.</p><p>The cleric may decide when during the day to take on his elemental form. For this purpose, a game day begins and ends at midnight. If the cleric fails to decide, his body transforms at the last moment possible. For instance, an cleric who must assume elemental form for two hours a day but hasn't transformed earlier changes two hours before midnight. The transformation takes one round, during which time the cleric's body takes on an ethereal form. Only weapons that can affect ethereal bodies can harm him. Successful attacks at this time use his human characteristics (Armor Class, hit points, etc.) The elemental cannot act or defend while transforming.</p><p>The cleric cannot control his transformation back into human form. It takes place after the cleric has spent the entire required duration in elemental form. The transformation takes one complete round, during which time the cleric cannot act. The cleric takes on ethereal form for the round, so attacks that don.t reach into the Ethereal plane cannot harm him. Those attacks that can do so affect his elemental form (Hit Dice, Armor Class, magical resistance, etc.). As with the transformation into elemental form, the cleric cannot defend himself while in flux. Once the transformation is complete, the cleric reverts to his full human hit points.</p><table class=\"ip\"><caption>Elemental Clerics Ability Table</caption><tr class=\"bk\"><th>Lvl</th><th>Hit Dice/Variety</th><th>HD Re-rolls</th><th>Time</th><th>Summons</th></tr><tr><td>21</td><td>8 HD Standard</td><td>-</td><td>1 turn</td><td>-</td></tr><tr><td>22</td><td>12 HD Standard</td><td>-</td><td>3 turns</td><td>-</td></tr><tr><td>23</td><td>12 HD Standard</td><td>-</td><td>1 hour</td><td>-</td></tr><tr><td>24</td><td>16 HD Standard</td><td>1,2</td><td>2 hours</td><td>-</td></tr><tr><td>25</td><td>16 HD Standard</td><td>1,2</td><td>4 hours</td><td>-</td></tr><tr><td>26</td><td>10 HD Greater</td><td>1,2,3</td><td>6 hours</td><td>Lesser (1)</td></tr><tr><td>27</td><td>10 HD Greater</td><td>1,2,3</td><td>8 hours</td><td>Lesser (2)</td></tr><tr><td>28</td><td>14 HD Greater</td><td>1,2,3,4</td><td>12 hours</td><td>Lesser (3)</td></tr><tr><td>29</td><td>14 HD Greater</td><td>1,2,3,4</td><td>16 hours</td><td>Standard (1)</td></tr><tr><td>30</td><td>18 HD Greater</td><td>1,2,3,4</td><td>24 hours</td><td>Standard (3)</td></tr></table><p>Lvl indicates the level of the Cleric.<br>Hit Dice/Variety indicates the exact type of elemental form that the cleric will assume upon transformation.<br>HD Re-rolls indicates Hit Dice roll results that may be re-rolled when generating the elemental form's hit points.<br>Time is the length of time that the Cleric must remain in elemental form following transformation.<br>Summons indicates the type of elementals that may be summoned while in elemental form.
