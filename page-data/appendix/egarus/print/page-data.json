While the powers listed above are the most common, some aarakocra have different or additional powers.</p><p class=\"f\">A race of intelligent, birdlike creatures living in the deepest deserts of Athas, the rare Athasian <a href=\"/appendix/aarakocr\">aarakocra</a> spends its time soaring on thermals in search of food.</p><p>The aarakocra is 7 to 8 feet tall with a wingspan of 20 feet or more. Because of its large wingspan, an aarakocra can carry as much as 75% of its own body weight and still fly easily. An aarakocra can fly a short distance carrying a burden equaling 125% of its own body weight. The average body weight of a full grown male is 100 pounds and a female is 85 pounds.</p><p>Each wing has a &ldquo;hand&rdquo; at its midpoint, consisting of three fingers and an opposable thumb. The fourth finger forms the rigid leading edge of the wing. In flight the hands cannot be used, but on the ground the aarakocra can use its hands almost as a human would. The aarakocra's body is protected by a thin bony plate on the chest, much like a solid rib cage. Talons on its legs can be used as claws and can be retracted to reveal a second set of hands, also with three fingers and an opposable thumb. Except for the chest plate, the entire skeleton is hollow and extremely fragile.</p><p>From a distance, the Athasian aarakocra resembles a huge <a href=\"/appendix/bird\">vulture</a>. Its black eyes, set in the front of the head, provide excellent vision over a long range. The plumage is generally black with a white collar for adult males and black or brown with a smaller white collar for females. Adolescents are a mixture of brown and black. The beak is large and covers most of the head. Plumage begins at the crown of the head and is darker near the head, except for the collar. Athasian aarakocra speak their own language and the languages of vultures and other large birds. Some speak the common tongue (5% to 10% chance depending on how deep in the wastelands a tribe lives).</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Combat:</b> Aarakocra can fight in the air or on the ground. They prefer aerial combat since their bones are too fragile to withstand a solid blow from a human-sized opponent. In combat against creatures on the ground, they prefer to fly over their victim and drop weighted nets. Some aarakocra use darts to harass ground-based opponents.</p><p>If their opponents can fly, the aarakocra generally forgo the use of the net, although large groups sometimes use nets on flying creatures. Normally, aarakocra attack flying creatures with long spears, diving from above and allowing the momentum to carry the spear through the target. Such an attack doubles the damage if the aarakocra have been able to dive at least 50 feet. Only the very largest aarakocra can carry more than one of these spears, they can attack with both at once with no penalty, causing double damage on each strike. All diving attacks are made at +4 and should be treated as a charge attack. All other penalties and restrictions of charge attacks apply.</p><p>The effect of the aarakocra's nets depends on if the opponent is flying at the time it becomes entangled. Creatures on the ground that are hit by a net are entangled and unable to participate in any combat until they make a successful Strength check to get free of the net. Flying creatures hit by a net can no longer fly and immediately begin falling. If they cannot escape the net or use some magical means to arrest the fall, normal falling damage applies.</p><p>Unless victims are entangled in nets, aarakocra are cautious in ground combat. If the aarakocra outnumber their opponents they advance in a straight line and thrust with their spears. If outnumbered, or the opponents are particularly tough, the aarakocra withdraw. Victims entangled in nets are killed or incapacitated for use as food or ransom.</p><p>Athasian aarakocra are mindful of their physical limitations as well as their comparatively low psionic abilities. They do not normally initiate psionic combat. At the first sign of psionic powers from any of their victims, however, all aarakocra that have some ability will use whatever attack and defense modes they can in an attempt to destroy the threat. Large groups of is or more aarakocra may initiate psionic combat if their leaders feel they can win quickly and avoid physical combat.</p><p>In desperation, an aarakocra can attempt to bite an opponent in combat. Because of the unwieldiness of its beak, the aarakocra has a THAC0 of 18 if attacking with this appendage. Further, the birdman causes only 1d2 points of damage with the beak.</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Habitat/Society:</b> Athasian aarakocra live in tribes with 6-20 (2d8+4) members, depending on the prestige of the leader. The largest tribe ever recorded had 50 members. The tribal hunting territory depends on the size of the tribe, usually about 500 square miles for a tribe of 10 members. There are no rigid boundaries between tribes and border disputes are not uncommon.</p><p>Alignments of tribe members are similar to the alignment of the leader. A tribe that has a leader who is neutral good may have neutral good, chaotic good, lawful good, and true neutral members. A predominantly evil tribe does not recognize boundaries with other tribes and treats other tribes as inferior beings to be eliminated.</p><p>Athasian aarakocra aren't happy in enclosed spaces, but they they take refuge in a cave or building if necessary.</p><p>Nonevil tribes live in rocky aeries in the highest peaks they can find. Evil tribes are normally nomadic and use an aerie made by another tribe if they need to remain in an area for a long time, even if they have to evict the tribe that made the nest.</p><p>Aarakocra aren't friendly toward intruders in their territory, especially caravans. They try to extract a toll from the caravan for passage through the desert. Good-aligned tribes allow unhindered passage of caravans that pay a tribute. If someone refuses to pay the tribute, the aarakocra try to capture scouts or outriders from the party and hold them until an even larger tribute is paid. The payment may be either livestock or shiny objects. Aarakocra are smart enough not to be taken in by glass baubles instead of gems, although they cannot tell the difference between the more common gems and the rare ones.</p><p>Evil tribes ask for tribute and often attack a caravan whether it pays or not. Aarakocra always demand shiny objects such as stones. These tribes find humans and demihumans to be quite tasty and prefer them to other food.</p><p>Good-aligned tribes of aarakocra sometimes return a lost traveler to the edge of the desert after first removing any valuables the traveler may be carrying. On very rare occasions a tribe might return a lost group of travelers to the more frequently traveled parts of the desert, again after first taking any valuables as payment.</p><p>The oldest male is the leader of the tribal hunting party and has 4+4 Hit Dice. The oldest female is in charge of the tribal aerie and has 3+3 HD. In tribes that have more than 15 members, the next oldest aarakocra serves as shaman and has 3+3 HD; the shaman completes the triumvirate necessary for proper worship and the summoning of elementals. (Interestingly, no magic-using aarakocra has ever been recorded.) Tribes without a shaman cannot summon <a href=\"/appendix/element1\">air elementals</a>, which is an important part of aarakocra culture.</p><p>The shaman is the leader of the daily sun worship. Aarakocra worship the sun because it provides them with the thermals they need to soar in search of food. The shaman also leads the mystic rituals used to summon an air elemental. Summoning an air elemental is usually done only in preparation for the tribe's most sacred ceremony, the hunt. Small tribes must band together for this ceremony to allow the triumvirate to be formed.</p><p>The ceremony to summon an air elemental must be conducted at dawn and requires the oldest male and female to emit a highpitched keening whistle. The shaman conducts an intricate dance around them, simultaneously chanting an ancient summoning mantra.</p><p>The hunt is the final part of the initiation of adolescent aarakocra to adulthood and often takes the tribe far from their normal teritory. The target is always a <a href=\"/appendix/drakalsi\">silt drake</a>. The hunt is the only time the females leave the relative safety of the nest. Even an evil tribe will not interfere with a tribe on a hunt. An air elemental is often summoned to help find the drake, but never takes part in the actual combat. Although the adult members of the tribe take part in the initial phases of the combat, it is the initiates who deliver the final, killing blows to me drake. Scars from the hunt are considered a mark of pride among all aarakocra.</p><p>The females spend about eight months of the year incubating their eggs. Athasian aarakocra mate for life and a pair normally produces as many as 10 offspring. A female lays one egg a year. Constant incubation is not required because of the high daytime temperatures, so the females can maintain the nest and keep the tribe's treasure in order.</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Ecology:</b> Athasian aarakocra are high on the food chain and have no natural enemies other than <a href=\"/appendix/drakatha\">drakes</a>. Unless evil, aarakocra leave their own territory only to hunt the silt drake and return as soon as possible when the hunt is over. (Evil aarakocra attack others, as noted above.) Aarakocra eggs and hatchlings are sought after by wealthy land owners who wish to use the creatures as scouts and sentries. An egg can bring as much as 10 cp in Tyr's marketplace. Tribes that have had eggs or hatchlings stolen have long memories and sometimes take revenge against the thief at a later date. Captive aarakocra join any tribe they come in contact with.</p><p>Athasian aarakocra have a natural life span of 21-30 years.</p><br clear=\"all\" style=\"clear:both; height:0;\">\r\n","images":["<img src=\"grf/ds.gif\" width=\"150\" height=\"75\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Dark Sun\" title=\"Dark Sun\" align=\"right\">","<img src=\"img/aarakath.gif\" alt=\"Aarakocra (Athas)\" title=\"Aarakocra (Athas)\" border=\"0\" width=\"300\" height=\"360\" style=\"text-align:right;\" align=\"right\">","<img src=\"grf/add2_01.gif\" width=\"200\" height=\"56\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Advanced Dungeons & Dragons 2nd Edition\">"],"setting":"Dark Sun","statblock":{"Aarakocra (Athas)":{"Activity Cycle":"Day","Alignment":"Any","Armor Class":"7","Climate/Terrain":"Deep desert","Damage/Attack":"1d3/1d3 or by weapon","Diet":"Carnivore","Frequency":"Rare","Hit Dice":"2+2","Intelligence":"Average (8-10)","Magic Resistance":"Nil","Morale":"Steady (11)","Movement":"6, Fl 36 (C)","No. Appearing":"1d10","No. of Attacks":"2","Organization":"Tribal","Size":"M (20'+ wingspan)","Special Attacks":"Nil","Special Defenses":"Nil","THAC0":"17","Treasure":"Varies","XP Value":"65"}},"title":"Aarakocra (Athas)"},"sources":["2433"],"statblock_names":[],"title":"Aarakocra (Athas)","prev_key":"zygraat","next_key":"aarakocr","monster_path":"/appendix/aarakath"}}},"pageContext":{"monster_key":"egarus","monster_data":{"TSR":["2635"],"fullBody":"  <table cellspacing=\"0\" cellpadding=\"0\"><tr><th>Climate/Terrain:</th><td>Quasiplane of Vacuum</td></tr><tr><th>Frequency:</th><td>Rare</td></tr><tr><th>Organization:</th><td>Patch</td></tr><tr><th>Activity Cycle:</th><td>N/A</td></tr><tr><th>Diet:</th><td>Absence</td></tr><tr><th>Intelligence:</th><td>Non- (0)</td></tr><tr><th>Treasure:</th><td>Nil</td></tr><tr><th>Alignment:</th><td>Neutral</td></tr><tr><th>No. Appearing:</th><td>1d3 patches</td></tr><tr><th>Armor Class:</th><td>10</td></tr><tr><th>Movement:</th><td>0</td></tr><tr><th>Hit Dice:</th><td>N/A</td></tr><tr><th>THAC0:</th><td>N/A</td></tr><tr><th>No. of Attacks:</th><td>0</td></tr><tr><th>Damage/Attack:</th><td>Nil</td></tr><tr><th>Special Attacks:</th><td>Disintegration</td></tr><tr><th>Special Defenses:</th><td>Telcportation, immune to cold, fire, physical attacks, most spells</td></tr><tr><th>Magic Resistance:</th><td>25%</td></tr><tr><th>Size:</th><td>T (one patch is 6&rdquo; across)</td></tr><tr><th>Morale:</th><td>N/A</td></tr><tr><th>XP Value:</th><td>270</td></tr></table><p class=\"f\">A yawning expanse of unending nothingness stretches into infinity, turning a body's mind in on itself when he tries to grasp the enormity of it. The quasiplane of Vacuum is, by all accounts, one of the loneliest, most inhospitable places in all the multiverse. Even the most adventuresome planewalkers find little reason to explore this plane. Betterknown voids like the Astral and inhospitable backwaters like the bottom layer of Pandemonium look like well-traveled throughways teeming with life by comparison.</p><p>That's why when truly canny bloods need to get rid of something - something that must disappear from all existence forever - they banish it to the quasiplane of Vacuum. But sometimes even that doesn't work.</p><p>See, it all started in the Abyss. Some hapless berk had traveled to one of the layers he considered to be &ldquo;safe&rdquo;. Why he'd gone, and why he thought <i>any</i> part of the Abyss was safe, has been lost in the annals of time. He was Clueless; perhaps nothing more need be said.</p><p>When he returned to his prime world, however, he inadvertently brought with him some fungus that clung to the tip of his shoe. This Abyssal fungus, finding itself on an unprepared and unsuspecting world, immediately began to grow at an alarming rate. Unable to scrape off the fungus, the addle-cove discarded the boot - but that didn't solve the problem. It grew and grew, proliferating in the pleasant environment. Soon it covered the sod's house. While some of the local graybeards examined the fungus, it spread to the neighbors' cases. Suddenly afraid, the graybeards tried to burn the stuff. It wouldn't burn.</p><p>Within days, the growth covered half the town, and the locals'd given it the name &ldquo;egarus&rdquo; (chant is, the word's a curse). Wizards arrived on the scene to help, and while some of their magic was effective, it was too little, too late. The wind had carried bits of fungus throughout the region. Certain spells and magical devices held the growth at bay or even destroyed a patch or two, but there weren't enough wizards to keep up with the spreading egarus fungus. Plus, even when it was apparently eradicated in one area, the insidious stuff reappeared elsewhere. There seemed no way to tell when it was really and truly gone!</p><p>Finally, a few deities who had a considerable following on this prime world took pity on the inhabitants. It was obvious that soon the Abyssal fungus would destroy the entire world. Thus, the powers answered the prayers of their worshipers and opened gates to the quasiplane of Vacuum. After many mortal generations of work, the primes managed to round up all of the fungus and thrust it through the multitude of gates. By this time, their best wizards had developed spells to detect the growth, so they could be sure that it was all gone.</p><p>At last, the gates were sealed. Everyone figured that with nothing to grow on, nothing to feed on, the egarus fungus would surely die on Vacuum.</p><p>Even the gods' plans can sometimes go awry.</p><p>The fungus didn't die. It adapted. The plane of Vacuum offered only emptiness - so it began to feed on that. The fungus learned to thrive on the absence of matter and energy. (Though the Dustmen would certainly disagree, there is nothing so tenacious, so powerful, as life and its ability to adapt and continue living.) In its new home, the egarus fungus formed tiny clumps that floated in the void, feeding on the nothingness like a leech or a cancer.</p><p>The fungus thrives still. Its dull white lumps don't move or do anything that might call attention to themselves. In fact, it's extraordinarily unlikely that a basher visiting the quasiplane would ever encounter the tiny clumps, even if he actively looked for them. Despite this, the egarus' adaptations to its new environment make it a real threat to those barmy enough to enter the plane of Vacuum.</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Combat:</b> The egarus feeds on nonexistence, so anything with substance is anathema to it. Even in the infinite reaches of Vacuum, it cannot abide matter and energy in any amount other than itself. Thus, the fungus attacks anyone or anything entering the plane and alerting its delicate senses. A patch of egarus can sense matter many thousands of miles away - though on the plane of Vacuum, distance means very little.</p><p>The fungus attacks by using an ability much like <i>teleport without error</i> to reach the offending matter or energy. (It cannot use the ability to leave the plane, however.) Once in close proximity (within 25 feet), the fungus begins breaking things down, effectively disintegrating its target. This process is slow, but insidious. No magical protections can defend against this (for they, too, are broken down), nor can magic resistance provide any help.</p><p>The fungus attacks energy first, so light sources, flames (torches or magical flame weapons, for example), and active spell effects are extinguished first. This happens at a rate of one energy source per round per egarus patch, in a random order. Nonliving material objects are attacked next, and again, are simply disintegrated one by one until nothing stands between the fungus and the living being. Magical items and creatures are permitted a saving throw vs. disintegration or death magic to avoid this effect.</p><p>Like so many things in the Inner Planes, the egarus can be stopped only by its utter destruction. This, fortunately, is not terribly hard to do. <i>Cure disease</i>, <i>disintegrate</i>, <i>finger of death</i>, <i>lightning bolt</i>, <i>shocking grasp</i>, or <i>slay living</i> spells destroy a patch instantly, as does the application of any acid, alcohol, electrical attack, or even a large amount of water (at least 60 gallons, which must be used to dilute and disperse the patch before the water freezes due to the cold of the plane). <i>Hold monster</i>, <i>hold plant</i>, or <i>slow</i> stop the egarus from attacking. The fungus is immune to cold, fire, physical attacks, and most spells other than those discussed above.</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Habitat/Society:</b> The egarus has adapted well to its new habitat. It attacks intruders on the plane, since they threaten the emptiness the fungus requires to survive.</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Ecology:</b> Presumably, the egarus reproduces like other types of fungi once it consumes &ldquo;nourishment&rdquo;. There's no guessing how many clumps of egarus fungus now exist within the endless void.</p><p>If a patch of egarus were taken out of the quasiplane of Vacuum - say, on the tip of another sod's shoe - the fungus couldn't survive. Since it has adapted to thrive in the absence of matter. the egarus would literally starve to death. Before it died, however, it would destroy massice quantities of matter in an attempt to create a suitable empty void.</p><br clear=\"all\" style=\"clear:both; height:0;\">\r\n","images":["<img src=\"grf/ps.gif\" width=\"150\" height=\"75\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Planescape\" title=\"Planescape\" align=\"right\">","<img src=\"img/egarus.gif\" alt=\"Egarus\" title=\"Egarus\" border=\"0\" width=\"300\" height=\"360\" style=\"text-align:right;\" align=\"right\">","<img src=\"grf/add2_01.gif\" width=\"200\" height=\"56\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Advanced Dungeons & Dragons 2nd Edition\">"],"setting":"Planescape","statblock":{"Egarus":{"Activity Cycle":"N/A","Alignment":"Neutral","Armor Class":"10","Climate/Terrain":"Quasiplane of Vacuum","Damage/Attack":"Nil","Diet":"Absence","Frequency":"Rare","Hit Dice":"N/A","Intelligence":"Non- (0)","Magic Resistance":"25%","Morale":"N/A","Movement":"0","No. Appearing":"1d3 patches","No. of Attacks":"0","Organization":"Patch","Size":"T (one patch is 6&rdquo; across)","Special Attacks":"Disintegration","Special Defenses":"Telcportation, immune to cold, fire, physical attacks, most spells","THAC0":"N/A","Treasure":"Nil","XP Value":"270"}},"title":"Egarus"},"sources":["2635"],"statblock_names":[],"title":"Egarus","prev_key":"eelgimor","next_key":"einheria","monster_path":"/appendix/egarus"}},"staticQueryHashes":[],"slicesMap":{}}
