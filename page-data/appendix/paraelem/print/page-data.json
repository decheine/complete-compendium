While the powers listed above are the most common, some aarakocra have different or additional powers.</p><p class=\"f\">A race of intelligent, birdlike creatures living in the deepest deserts of Athas, the rare Athasian <a href=\"/appendix/aarakocr\">aarakocra</a> spends its time soaring on thermals in search of food.</p><p>The aarakocra is 7 to 8 feet tall with a wingspan of 20 feet or more. Because of its large wingspan, an aarakocra can carry as much as 75% of its own body weight and still fly easily. An aarakocra can fly a short distance carrying a burden equaling 125% of its own body weight. The average body weight of a full grown male is 100 pounds and a female is 85 pounds.</p><p>Each wing has a &ldquo;hand&rdquo; at its midpoint, consisting of three fingers and an opposable thumb. The fourth finger forms the rigid leading edge of the wing. In flight the hands cannot be used, but on the ground the aarakocra can use its hands almost as a human would. The aarakocra's body is protected by a thin bony plate on the chest, much like a solid rib cage. Talons on its legs can be used as claws and can be retracted to reveal a second set of hands, also with three fingers and an opposable thumb. Except for the chest plate, the entire skeleton is hollow and extremely fragile.</p><p>From a distance, the Athasian aarakocra resembles a huge <a href=\"/appendix/bird\">vulture</a>. Its black eyes, set in the front of the head, provide excellent vision over a long range. The plumage is generally black with a white collar for adult males and black or brown with a smaller white collar for females. Adolescents are a mixture of brown and black. The beak is large and covers most of the head. Plumage begins at the crown of the head and is darker near the head, except for the collar. Athasian aarakocra speak their own language and the languages of vultures and other large birds. Some speak the common tongue (5% to 10% chance depending on how deep in the wastelands a tribe lives).</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Combat:</b> Aarakocra can fight in the air or on the ground. They prefer aerial combat since their bones are too fragile to withstand a solid blow from a human-sized opponent. In combat against creatures on the ground, they prefer to fly over their victim and drop weighted nets. Some aarakocra use darts to harass ground-based opponents.</p><p>If their opponents can fly, the aarakocra generally forgo the use of the net, although large groups sometimes use nets on flying creatures. Normally, aarakocra attack flying creatures with long spears, diving from above and allowing the momentum to carry the spear through the target. Such an attack doubles the damage if the aarakocra have been able to dive at least 50 feet. Only the very largest aarakocra can carry more than one of these spears, they can attack with both at once with no penalty, causing double damage on each strike. All diving attacks are made at +4 and should be treated as a charge attack. All other penalties and restrictions of charge attacks apply.</p><p>The effect of the aarakocra's nets depends on if the opponent is flying at the time it becomes entangled. Creatures on the ground that are hit by a net are entangled and unable to participate in any combat until they make a successful Strength check to get free of the net. Flying creatures hit by a net can no longer fly and immediately begin falling. If they cannot escape the net or use some magical means to arrest the fall, normal falling damage applies.</p><p>Unless victims are entangled in nets, aarakocra are cautious in ground combat. If the aarakocra outnumber their opponents they advance in a straight line and thrust with their spears. If outnumbered, or the opponents are particularly tough, the aarakocra withdraw. Victims entangled in nets are killed or incapacitated for use as food or ransom.</p><p>Athasian aarakocra are mindful of their physical limitations as well as their comparatively low psionic abilities. They do not normally initiate psionic combat. At the first sign of psionic powers from any of their victims, however, all aarakocra that have some ability will use whatever attack and defense modes they can in an attempt to destroy the threat. Large groups of is or more aarakocra may initiate psionic combat if their leaders feel they can win quickly and avoid physical combat.</p><p>In desperation, an aarakocra can attempt to bite an opponent in combat. Because of the unwieldiness of its beak, the aarakocra has a THAC0 of 18 if attacking with this appendage. Further, the birdman causes only 1d2 points of damage with the beak.</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Habitat/Society:</b> Athasian aarakocra live in tribes with 6-20 (2d8+4) members, depending on the prestige of the leader. The largest tribe ever recorded had 50 members. The tribal hunting territory depends on the size of the tribe, usually about 500 square miles for a tribe of 10 members. There are no rigid boundaries between tribes and border disputes are not uncommon.</p><p>Alignments of tribe members are similar to the alignment of the leader. A tribe that has a leader who is neutral good may have neutral good, chaotic good, lawful good, and true neutral members. A predominantly evil tribe does not recognize boundaries with other tribes and treats other tribes as inferior beings to be eliminated.</p><p>Athasian aarakocra aren't happy in enclosed spaces, but they they take refuge in a cave or building if necessary.</p><p>Nonevil tribes live in rocky aeries in the highest peaks they can find. Evil tribes are normally nomadic and use an aerie made by another tribe if they need to remain in an area for a long time, even if they have to evict the tribe that made the nest.</p><p>Aarakocra aren't friendly toward intruders in their territory, especially caravans. They try to extract a toll from the caravan for passage through the desert. Good-aligned tribes allow unhindered passage of caravans that pay a tribute. If someone refuses to pay the tribute, the aarakocra try to capture scouts or outriders from the party and hold them until an even larger tribute is paid. The payment may be either livestock or shiny objects. Aarakocra are smart enough not to be taken in by glass baubles instead of gems, although they cannot tell the difference between the more common gems and the rare ones.</p><p>Evil tribes ask for tribute and often attack a caravan whether it pays or not. Aarakocra always demand shiny objects such as stones. These tribes find humans and demihumans to be quite tasty and prefer them to other food.</p><p>Good-aligned tribes of aarakocra sometimes return a lost traveler to the edge of the desert after first removing any valuables the traveler may be carrying. On very rare occasions a tribe might return a lost group of travelers to the more frequently traveled parts of the desert, again after first taking any valuables as payment.</p><p>The oldest male is the leader of the tribal hunting party and has 4+4 Hit Dice. The oldest female is in charge of the tribal aerie and has 3+3 HD. In tribes that have more than 15 members, the next oldest aarakocra serves as shaman and has 3+3 HD; the shaman completes the triumvirate necessary for proper worship and the summoning of elementals. (Interestingly, no magic-using aarakocra has ever been recorded.) Tribes without a shaman cannot summon <a href=\"/appendix/element1\">air elementals</a>, which is an important part of aarakocra culture.</p><p>The shaman is the leader of the daily sun worship. Aarakocra worship the sun because it provides them with the thermals they need to soar in search of food. The shaman also leads the mystic rituals used to summon an air elemental. Summoning an air elemental is usually done only in preparation for the tribe's most sacred ceremony, the hunt. Small tribes must band together for this ceremony to allow the triumvirate to be formed.</p><p>The ceremony to summon an air elemental must be conducted at dawn and requires the oldest male and female to emit a highpitched keening whistle. The shaman conducts an intricate dance around them, simultaneously chanting an ancient summoning mantra.</p><p>The hunt is the final part of the initiation of adolescent aarakocra to adulthood and often takes the tribe far from their normal teritory. The target is always a <a href=\"/appendix/drakalsi\">silt drake</a>. The hunt is the only time the females leave the relative safety of the nest. Even an evil tribe will not interfere with a tribe on a hunt. An air elemental is often summoned to help find the drake, but never takes part in the actual combat. Although the adult members of the tribe take part in the initial phases of the combat, it is the initiates who deliver the final, killing blows to me drake. Scars from the hunt are considered a mark of pride among all aarakocra.</p><p>The females spend about eight months of the year incubating their eggs. Athasian aarakocra mate for life and a pair normally produces as many as 10 offspring. A female lays one egg a year. Constant incubation is not required because of the high daytime temperatures, so the females can maintain the nest and keep the tribe's treasure in order.</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Ecology:</b> Athasian aarakocra are high on the food chain and have no natural enemies other than <a href=\"/appendix/drakatha\">drakes</a>. Unless evil, aarakocra leave their own territory only to hunt the silt drake and return as soon as possible when the hunt is over. (Evil aarakocra attack others, as noted above.) Aarakocra eggs and hatchlings are sought after by wealthy land owners who wish to use the creatures as scouts and sentries. An egg can bring as much as 10 cp in Tyr's marketplace. Tribes that have had eggs or hatchlings stolen have long memories and sometimes take revenge against the thief at a later date. Captive aarakocra join any tribe they come in contact with.</p><p>Athasian aarakocra have a natural life span of 21-30 years.</p><p></p><br clear=\"all\" style=\"clear:both; height:0;\">\r\n","images":["<img src=\"grf/ds.gif\" width=\"150\" height=\"75\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Dark Sun\" title=\"Dark Sun\" align=\"right\">","<img src=\"img/aarakath.gif\" alt=\"Aarakocra (Athas)\" title=\"Aarakocra (Athas)\" border=\"0\" width=\"300\" height=\"360\" style=\"text-align:right;\" align=\"right\">","<img src=\"grf/add2_01.gif\" width=\"200\" height=\"56\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Advanced Dungeons & Dragons 2nd Edition\">"],"setting":"Dark Sun","statblock":{"Aarakocra (Athas)":{"Activity Cycle":"Day","Alignment":"Any","Armor Class":"7","Climate/Terrain":"Deep desert","Damage/Attack":"1d3/1d3 or by weapon","Diet":"Carnivore","Frequency":"Rare","Hit Dice":"2+2","Intelligence":"Average (8-10)","Magic Resistance":"Nil","Morale":"Steady (11)","Movement":"6, Fl 36 (C)","No. Appearing":"1d10","No. of Attacks":"2","Organization":"Tribal","Size":"M (20'+ wingspan)","Special Attacks":"Nil","Special Defenses":"Nil","THAC0":"17","Treasure":"Varies","XP Value":"65"}},"title":"Aarakocra (Athas)"},"sources":["2433"],"statblock_names":[],"title":"Aarakocra (Athas)","prev_key":"zygraat","next_key":"aarakocr","monster_path":"/appendix/aarakath"}}},"pageContext":{"monster_key":"paraelem","monster_data":{"TSR":["2635"],"fullBody":"  <table cellspacing=\"0\" cellpadding=\"0\"><tr class=\"bk\"><th> </th><th class=\"cn\">Ice</th><th class=\"cn\">Magma</th><th class=\"cn\">Ooze</th><th class=\"cn\">Smoke</th></tr><tr><th>Climate/Terrain:</th><td>Paraplane of Ice</td><td>Paraplane of Magma</td><td>Paraplane of Ooze</td><td>Paraplane of Smoke</td></tr><tr><th>Frequency:</th><td>Common</td><td>Common</td><td>Common</td><td>Common</td></tr><tr><th>Organization:</th><td>Band</td><td>Band</td><td>Band</td><td>Band</td></tr><tr><th>Activity Cycle:</th><td>Any</td><td>Any</td><td>Any</td><td>Any</td></tr><tr><th>Diet:</th><td>Warmth</td><td>Any solid</td><td>Any solid</td><td>Air</td></tr><tr><th>Intelligence:</th><td>Low to high (5-14)</td><td>Low to high (5-14)</td><td>Low to high (5-14)</td><td>Low to high (5-14)</td></tr><tr><th>Treasure:</th><td>Nil</td><td>Nil</td><td>Nil</td><td>Nil</td></tr><tr><th>Alignment:</th><td>Neutral</td><td>Neutral</td><td>Neutral</td><td>Neutral</td></tr><tr><th>No. Appearing:</th><td>1d6</td><td>2d4</td><td>1d6</td><td>1d6</td></tr><tr><th>Armor Class:</th><td>3</td><td>3</td><td>0</td><td>2</td></tr><tr><th>Movement:</th><td>6</td><td>6</td><td>36</td><td>Fl 18 (E)</td></tr><tr><th>Hit Dice:</th><td>8, 12, or 16</td><td>8, 12, or 16</td><td>8, 12, or 16</td><td>8, 12, or 16</td></tr><tr><th>THAC0:</th><td>8 HD: 13<br>12 HD: 9<br>16 HD: 5</td><td>8 HD: 13<br>12 HD: 9<br>16 HD: 5</td><td>8 HD: 13<br>12 HD: 9<br>16 HD: 5</td><td>8 HD: 13<br>12 HD: 9<br>16 HD: 5</td></tr><tr><th>No. of Attacks:</th><td>1</td><td>1</td><td>1</td><td>Special</td></tr><tr><th>Damage/Attack:</th><td>3d8</td><td>3d6</td><td>2d8</td><td>2d8</td></tr><tr><th>Special Attacks:</th><td>Cold aura</td><td>Heat aura</td><td>Multiple tendrils</td><td>Blinding smoke</td></tr><tr><th>Special Defenses:</th><td>See below</td><td>See below</td><td>See below</td><td>See below</td></tr><tr><th>Magic Resistance:</th><td>Nil</td><td>Nil</td><td>Nil</td><td>Nil</td></tr><tr><th>Size:</th><td>L (8-16' tall)</td><td>L (8-16' tall)</td><td>L (8-16' tall)</td><td>L (8-16' tall)</td></tr><tr><th>Morale:</th><td>Champion (15-16)</td><td>Champion (15-16)</td><td>Champion (15-16)</td><td>Champion (15-16)</td></tr><tr><th>XP Value:</th><td>8 HD: 7.000<br>12 HD: 11,000<br>16 HD: 15,000</td><td>8 HD: 3,000<br>12 HD: 7,000<br>16 HD: 11,000</td><td>8 HD: 3,000<br>12 HD: 7,000<br>16 HD: 11,000</td><td>8 HD: 3,000<br>12 HD: 7,000<br>16 HD: 11,000</td></tr></table><p class=\"f\">Between the Elemental Planes of Air, Earth, Fire, and Water lie four others - the Paraelemental Planes - that represent different combinations of those elements. And whereas the Elemental Planes spawn <a href=\"/appendix/elementa\">elementals</a>, the Paraelemental Planes create, naturally enough, paraelementals - creatures that embody the natures of Ice, Magma, Ooze, and Smoke. The four kinds of paraelementals are</p><p>generally regarded as slightly less powerful than elementals, yet still mightier than quasielementals (though plenty of inner-planar scholars dispute such rankings). Due to the nature of their home planes - which are, more or less, mixtures of two elements - parelementals're often thought to exhibit dual characters, though this manifests Itself in different ways.</p><p>By and large, paraelementals help to sustain themselves by consuming their opposites. In other words, ice paraelementals drain warmth, smoke paraelementals ingest air, and so on. This strikes some as a bit odd - why wouldn't an ice creature keep itself alive by surrounding itself with cold? But that's the wrong kind of question, and the Rule of Threes explains why. First of all, paraelementals won't starve to death if they <i>don't</i> consume their opposites; after all, they're just spirits that shape bodies for themselves out of the substance of their home plane. Second, the paraplanes don't <i>have</i> much of their opposites, anyway - there just ain't a lot of warmth on Ice. And third, the paraelementals don't actually <i>eat</i> their opposites; rather, they gain sustenance from the sheer act of converting it. Thus, an ice paraelemental relishes draining away the heat of a fire, not consuming the actual warmth itself.</p><p>Many paraelementals aren't too smart, but those with better than low Intelligence usually prefer to communicate in their own language.</p><h2>Ice Paraelemental</h2><p class=\"f\">From the plane of absolute cold, this tall, humanoid creature is utterly - dangerously - frigid. Its body is translucent white, made of icy crystals covered in patches of frost. Piercing blue eyes peer out of deep sockets.</p><p>Some folks refer to an ice paraelemental as a cold or frost paraelemental instead, but it's all the same thing.</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Combat:</b> The freezing touch of an ice paraelemental causes 3d8 points of damage, but it don't have to strike a sod to make him sorry. It also gives off intense cold the way a raging fire gives off heat, and all creatures within 10 feet suffer 1d4 points of damage per round from the numbing chill. What's more, the paraelemental is so cold that its touch freezes water (or similar fluids). It can freeze 100 square feet of watery liquid to a depth of 6 inches.</p><p>If wounded in some way, an ice paraelemental finds succor in cold environments. When in contact with natural ice, snow, or sleet, it automatically heals 1d8 hit points per round, up to its normal maximum. 'Course, this makes it sodding difficult to fight an ice paraelemental on its home paraplane.</p><p>All ice paraelementals can be struck only by +1 or better weapons, and they're completely immune to cold-based spells and magic. However, they're particularly vulnerable to heat-based attacks, which inflict twice their normal damage on the frosty creatures.</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Habitat/Society:</b> A good many ice paraelementals have turned from their neutrality to serve the evil lord <a href=\"/appendix/archomee\">Cryonax</a>, one of the Princes of Elemental Evil. But he's not the only blood with status on the paraplane - numerous minor lords and nobles rule their fellow paraelementals. They simply ignore Cryonax and his evil, maintaining their pure devotion to cold and nothing more. Ice paraelemental rulers gain their positions through strength and respect, and are often challenged by their underlings.</p><p>However, a planewalker traveling to Ice isn't likely to encounter any nobles or rulers. Instead, he'll find paraelementals operating in small, leaderless groups, hunting for food or patrolling for intruders. Strife among these creatures rarely occurs.</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Ecology:</b> Any warmth at all - or rather, the act of draining such warmth - provides a little sustenance for ice paraelementals. They steal it from any source of heat, even slowly snuffing out normal fires burning nearby. As mentioned earlier, they don't actually consume the heat so much as convert it. Naturally, those same flames'd be dangerously destructive if applied to an ice paraelemental directly. Perhaps that's part of the reason they drain the warmth from fire - to prevent it from being used against them.</p><h2>Magma Paraelemental</h2><p class=\"f\">The Paraelemental Plane of Magma is often confused with the Elemental Plane of Fire. While the conditions on Magma are dangerous to outsiders for many of the same reasons, Magma's as much about Earth as it is about Fire. That is, on the paraplane of Magma, the environment consists of molten rock - an uncommon substance on the plane of Fire, where there's little rock to melt.</p><p>From the waist up, a magma paraelemental resembles a huge, stocky humanoid being, but the lower portion of its body is nothing but an amorphous mass of molten stone. Most of its upper body is black rock, but a reddish heat shines from within - particularly from the eyes and mouth of the creature.</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Combat:</b> When it comes to combat, the magma paraelemental shares much with its icy cousin. Its super-heated touch inflicts 3d6 points of damage to a victim and sets combustibles (like wood) aflame.</p><p>However, the paraelemental's mere presence is also quite dangerous. Anyone within 20 feet of the creature is affected as if he were the target of an enhanced <i>heat metal</i> spell. That is, during the first round in the area, all metallic objects grow hot. During the second round, they inflict 1d4 points of damage to anyone in contact with them. In the third round (and all thereafter). anyone touching the scorching metal suffers 2d4 points of heat damage. What's more, at this point, even berks who aren't touching any metal sustain 1d4 points of damage from the incredible heat exuded by the monster.</p><p>Leaving the area reduces the effect by one step each round. For example, during the third round of close proximity to a magma paraelemental, a basher in plate mail armor suffers 2d4 points of damage. If he leaves the affected area, he suffers only 1d4 points of damage in the next round. In the round after that, his armor remains uncomfortably hot but inflicts no damage. And in the next round, the plate mail cools to its normal temperature.</p><p>A few cutters've pointed out an odd thing about the magma paraelemental: Although its touch causes less damage than that of a <a href=\"/appendix/element2\">fire elemental</a>, it exudes a debilitating aura of heat, whereas the fire elemental doesn't. This is because, quite simply, the fire elemental consists of more concentrated flame. It retains its intense heat in any environment, whereas the magma paraelemental constantly gives off warmth. That makes its touch less fiery, sure, but it also accounts for its radius of heat - an acceptable trade-off.</p><p>Magma paraelementals can be struck only by +1 or better weapons, and they're immune to the effects of heat and flame. They suffer normal damage from cold-based attacks. However, if they sustain a number of points of cold damage equal to their Hit Dice - in other words, if an 8-HD paraelemental suffers 8 points of cold damage - the cold affects them as would a <i>slow</i> spell.</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Habitat/Society:</b> Magma paraelementals almost never travel alone. They roam their plane in packs, living in large communities that seem to have no leaders at all. A group of paraelementals is usually harmonious, though distrustful of (or even hostile to) outsiders. They often war with the <a href=\"/appendix/mephit\">mephits</a> of their paraplane - clashes that almost always end very badly for the <a href=\"/appendix/mephit7\">mephits</a>.</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Ecology:</b> Magma paraelementals enjoy melting solid objects into liquid forms. They also derive a bit of sustenance from such actions.</p><h2>Ooze Paraelemental</h2><p class=\"f\">Called the mud elemental by some among the Clueless, this creature is a liquid mass of dark, writhing tendrils. Its malleable form allows it to squeeze through small openings and even under the cracks of doors.</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Combat:</b> The ooze paraelemental attacks by grappling with its tendrils and constricting its foes. A hit by the creature indicates that a tendril wraps around a sod and constricts him, causing 2d8 points of damage each round until the victim or the paraelemental dies (or until the paraelemental decides to call off the attack for some reason). While it constricts one foe, it can send out other tendrils to enwrap - and constrict - further victims with no limit, except that the creature can make only one new attack each round. Constricted sods can still make attacks and perform other actions, though they do so with a -2 penalty. 'Course, they can't flee unless they break free of the paraelemental's tendrils by succeeding at a bend bars roll.</p><p>The magical nature of an ooze paraelemental makes it immune to ordinary weapons; the creature can be struck only by those of +1 or greater enchantment. What's more, fire- and cold-based attacks inflict only half their normal damage. On the other hand, a <i>transmute mud to rock</i> spell (the reverse of <i>transmute rock to mud</i>) petrifies the paraelemental if it fails its saving throw.</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Habitat/Society:</b> A number of powerful, highly intelligent ooze paraelementals vie for control of their paraplane, though some <a href=\"/appendix/mephit2\">ooze mephits</a> or other usually claims dominion over them all (and is roundly ignored). Ooze paraelementals despise both ooze mephits and <a href=\"/appendix/oozespri\">ooze sprites</a>. Some say that they despise themselves as well, perhaps because of their own revolting nature.</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Ecology:</b> Ooze paraelementals subsist upon the act of crushing and eventually liquefying solid objects. This process takes many hours.</p><h2>Smoke Paraelementals</h2><p class=\"f\">At first glance, some bashers might not be able to tell the difference between a smoke paraelemental and a <a href=\"/appendix/quaelepo\">steam quasielemental</a>. Both appear to be large clouds of floating vapor or fog. A smoke paraelemental, however, is much darker in color, whereas the steam quasielemental is practically transparent.</p><p>Being composed entirely of smoke, this creature can fly through the air (often directed by strong winds, if present) or drift very low to the ground as a black, sooty mass.</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Combat:</b> In any given round, a smoke paraelemental can attack as many creatures as are within 10 feet of it. The paraelemental simply engulfs the targets and, if it makes a successful attack roll, partially enters their bodies, which causes 2d8 points of choking damage to each victim. Creatures who don't need to breathe are immune to this attack.</p><p>However, all sods in the affected area must also make a saving throw versus poison or suffer a -2 penalty to their attack rolls due to the paraelemental's blinding smoke. This saving throw is required even if the creature's own attack misses.</p><p>Smoke paraelementals can be harmed only by weapons of +1 or better enchantment. Heat- and air-based attacks made on them inflict 1 less point of damage per damage die (to a minimum of 1 point inflicted) - including attacks from fire and <a href=\"/appendix/element1\">air elementals</a>.</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Habitat/Society:</b> The paraplane of Smoke is divided into tiny kingdoms of smoke paraelementals, each ruled by a powerful smoke king. As on the paraplane of Ooze, a <a href=\"/appendix/mephit1\">smoke mephit</a> claims rulership of the entire plane, but the paraelelementals ignore him.</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Ecology:</b> Smoke paraelementals don't really eat. Instead, they merely breathe. Fact is, their only ecological function is to consume air and exude smoke.
