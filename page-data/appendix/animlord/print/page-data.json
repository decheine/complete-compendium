While the powers listed above are the most common, some aarakocra have different or additional powers.</p><p class=\"f\">A race of intelligent, birdlike creatures living in the deepest deserts of Athas, the rare Athasian <a href=\"/appendix/aarakocr\">aarakocra</a> spends its time soaring on thermals in search of food.</p><p>The aarakocra is 7 to 8 feet tall with a wingspan of 20 feet or more. Because of its large wingspan, an aarakocra can carry as much as 75% of its own body weight and still fly easily. An aarakocra can fly a short distance carrying a burden equaling 125% of its own body weight. The average body weight of a full grown male is 100 pounds and a female is 85 pounds.</p><p>Each wing has a &ldquo;hand&rdquo; at its midpoint, consisting of three fingers and an opposable thumb. The fourth finger forms the rigid leading edge of the wing. In flight the hands cannot be used, but on the ground the aarakocra can use its hands almost as a human would. The aarakocra's body is protected by a thin bony plate on the chest, much like a solid rib cage. Talons on its legs can be used as claws and can be retracted to reveal a second set of hands, also with three fingers and an opposable thumb. Except for the chest plate, the entire skeleton is hollow and extremely fragile.</p><p>From a distance, the Athasian aarakocra resembles a huge <a href=\"/appendix/bird\">vulture</a>. Its black eyes, set in the front of the head, provide excellent vision over a long range. The plumage is generally black with a white collar for adult males and black or brown with a smaller white collar for females. Adolescents are a mixture of brown and black. The beak is large and covers most of the head. Plumage begins at the crown of the head and is darker near the head, except for the collar. Athasian aarakocra speak their own language and the languages of vultures and other large birds. Some speak the common tongue (5% to 10% chance depending on how deep in the wastelands a tribe lives).</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Combat:</b> Aarakocra can fight in the air or on the ground. They prefer aerial combat since their bones are too fragile to withstand a solid blow from a human-sized opponent. In combat against creatures on the ground, they prefer to fly over their victim and drop weighted nets. Some aarakocra use darts to harass ground-based opponents.</p><p>If their opponents can fly, the aarakocra generally forgo the use of the net, although large groups sometimes use nets on flying creatures. Normally, aarakocra attack flying creatures with long spears, diving from above and allowing the momentum to carry the spear through the target. Such an attack doubles the damage if the aarakocra have been able to dive at least 50 feet. Only the very largest aarakocra can carry more than one of these spears, they can attack with both at once with no penalty, causing double damage on each strike. All diving attacks are made at +4 and should be treated as a charge attack. All other penalties and restrictions of charge attacks apply.</p><p>The effect of the aarakocra's nets depends on if the opponent is flying at the time it becomes entangled. Creatures on the ground that are hit by a net are entangled and unable to participate in any combat until they make a successful Strength check to get free of the net. Flying creatures hit by a net can no longer fly and immediately begin falling. If they cannot escape the net or use some magical means to arrest the fall, normal falling damage applies.</p><p>Unless victims are entangled in nets, aarakocra are cautious in ground combat. If the aarakocra outnumber their opponents they advance in a straight line and thrust with their spears. If outnumbered, or the opponents are particularly tough, the aarakocra withdraw. Victims entangled in nets are killed or incapacitated for use as food or ransom.</p><p>Athasian aarakocra are mindful of their physical limitations as well as their comparatively low psionic abilities. They do not normally initiate psionic combat. At the first sign of psionic powers from any of their victims, however, all aarakocra that have some ability will use whatever attack and defense modes they can in an attempt to destroy the threat. Large groups of is or more aarakocra may initiate psionic combat if their leaders feel they can win quickly and avoid physical combat.</p><p>In desperation, an aarakocra can attempt to bite an opponent in combat. Because of the unwieldiness of its beak, the aarakocra has a THAC0 of 18 if attacking with this appendage. Further, the birdman causes only 1d2 points of damage with the beak.</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Habitat/Society:</b> Athasian aarakocra live in tribes with 6-20 (2d8+4) members, depending on the prestige of the leader. The largest tribe ever recorded had 50 members. The tribal hunting territory depends on the size of the tribe, usually about 500 square miles for a tribe of 10 members. There are no rigid boundaries between tribes and border disputes are not uncommon.</p><p>Alignments of tribe members are similar to the alignment of the leader. A tribe that has a leader who is neutral good may have neutral good, chaotic good, lawful good, and true neutral members. A predominantly evil tribe does not recognize boundaries with other tribes and treats other tribes as inferior beings to be eliminated.</p><p>Athasian aarakocra aren't happy in enclosed spaces, but they they take refuge in a cave or building if necessary.</p><p>Nonevil tribes live in rocky aeries in the highest peaks they can find. Evil tribes are normally nomadic and use an aerie made by another tribe if they need to remain in an area for a long time, even if they have to evict the tribe that made the nest.</p><p>Aarakocra aren't friendly toward intruders in their territory, especially caravans. They try to extract a toll from the caravan for passage through the desert. Good-aligned tribes allow unhindered passage of caravans that pay a tribute. If someone refuses to pay the tribute, the aarakocra try to capture scouts or outriders from the party and hold them until an even larger tribute is paid. The payment may be either livestock or shiny objects. Aarakocra are smart enough not to be taken in by glass baubles instead of gems, although they cannot tell the difference between the more common gems and the rare ones.</p><p>Evil tribes ask for tribute and often attack a caravan whether it pays or not. Aarakocra always demand shiny objects such as stones. These tribes find humans and demihumans to be quite tasty and prefer them to other food.</p><p>Good-aligned tribes of aarakocra sometimes return a lost traveler to the edge of the desert after first removing any valuables the traveler may be carrying. On very rare occasions a tribe might return a lost group of travelers to the more frequently traveled parts of the desert, again after first taking any valuables as payment.</p><p>The oldest male is the leader of the tribal hunting party and has 4+4 Hit Dice. The oldest female is in charge of the tribal aerie and has 3+3 HD. In tribes that have more than 15 members, the next oldest aarakocra serves as shaman and has 3+3 HD; the shaman completes the triumvirate necessary for proper worship and the summoning of elementals. (Interestingly, no magic-using aarakocra has ever been recorded.) Tribes without a shaman cannot summon <a href=\"/appendix/element1\">air elementals</a>, which is an important part of aarakocra culture.</p><p>The shaman is the leader of the daily sun worship. Aarakocra worship the sun because it provides them with the thermals they need to soar in search of food. The shaman also leads the mystic rituals used to summon an air elemental. Summoning an air elemental is usually done only in preparation for the tribe's most sacred ceremony, the hunt. Small tribes must band together for this ceremony to allow the triumvirate to be formed.</p><p>The ceremony to summon an air elemental must be conducted at dawn and requires the oldest male and female to emit a highpitched keening whistle. The shaman conducts an intricate dance around them, simultaneously chanting an ancient summoning mantra.</p><p>The hunt is the final part of the initiation of adolescent aarakocra to adulthood and often takes the tribe far from their normal teritory. The target is always a <a href=\"/appendix/drakalsi\">silt drake</a>. The hunt is the only time the females leave the relative safety of the nest. Even an evil tribe will not interfere with a tribe on a hunt. An air elemental is often summoned to help find the drake, but never takes part in the actual combat. Although the adult members of the tribe take part in the initial phases of the combat, it is the initiates who deliver the final, killing blows to me drake. Scars from the hunt are considered a mark of pride among all aarakocra.</p><p>The females spend about eight months of the year incubating their eggs. Athasian aarakocra mate for life and a pair normally produces as many as 10 offspring. A female lays one egg a year. Constant incubation is not required because of the high daytime temperatures, so the females can maintain the nest and keep the tribe's treasure in order.</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Ecology:</b> Athasian aarakocra are high on the food chain and have no natural enemies other than <a href=\"/appendix/drakatha\">drakes</a>. Unless evil, aarakocra leave their own territory only to hunt the silt drake and return as soon as possible when the hunt is over. (Evil aarakocra attack others, as noted above.) Aarakocra eggs and hatchlings are sought after by wealthy land owners who wish to use the creatures as scouts and sentries. An egg can bring as much as 10 cp in Tyr's marketplace. Tribes that have had eggs or hatchlings stolen have long memories and sometimes take revenge against the thief at a later date. Captive aarakocra join any tribe they come in contact with.</p><p>Athasian aarakocra have a natural life span of 21-30 years.</p><br clear=\"all\" style=\"clear:both; height:0;\">\r\n","images":["<img src=\"grf/ds.gif\" width=\"150\" height=\"75\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Dark Sun\" title=\"Dark Sun\" align=\"right\">","<img src=\"img/aarakath.gif\" alt=\"Aarakocra (Athas)\" title=\"Aarakocra (Athas)\" border=\"0\" width=\"300\" height=\"360\" style=\"text-align:right;\" align=\"right\">","<img src=\"grf/add2_01.gif\" width=\"200\" height=\"56\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Advanced Dungeons & Dragons 2nd Edition\">"],"setting":"Dark Sun","statblock":{"Aarakocra (Athas)":{"Activity Cycle":"Day","Alignment":"Any","Armor Class":"7","Climate/Terrain":"Deep desert","Damage/Attack":"1d3/1d3 or by weapon","Diet":"Carnivore","Frequency":"Rare","Hit Dice":"2+2","Intelligence":"Average (8-10)","Magic Resistance":"Nil","Morale":"Steady (11)","Movement":"6, Fl 36 (C)","No. Appearing":"1d10","No. of Attacks":"2","Organization":"Tribal","Size":"M (20'+ wingspan)","Special Attacks":"Nil","Special Defenses":"Nil","THAC0":"17","Treasure":"Varies","XP Value":"65"}},"title":"Aarakocra (Athas)"},"sources":["2433"],"statblock_names":[],"title":"Aarakocra (Athas)","prev_key":"zygraat","next_key":"aarakocr","monster_path":"/appendix/aarakath"}}},"pageContext":{"monster_key":"animlord","monster_data":{"TSR":["2118","2602"],"fullBody":"  <table cellspacing=\"0\" cellpadding=\"0\"><tr class=\"bk\"><th> </th><th class=\"cn\">Cat Lord</th><th class=\"cn\">Hawk Lord</th><th class=\"cn\">Lizard Lord</th><th class=\"cn\">Wolf Lord</th></tr><tr><th>Climate/Terrain:</th><td>Beastlands</td><td>Beastlands</td><td>Beastlands</td><td>Beastlands</td></tr><tr><th>Frequency:</th><td>Unique</td><td>Unique</td><td>Unique</td><td>Unique</td></tr><tr><th>Organization:</th><td>Solitary</td><td>Solitary</td><td>Solitary</td><td>Solitary</td></tr><tr><th>Activity Cycle:</th><td>Any</td><td>Any</td><td>Any</td><td>Any</td></tr><tr><th>Diet:</th><td>Carnivore</td><td>Carnivore</td><td>Carnivore</td><td>Carnivore</td></tr><tr><th>Intelligence:</th><td>Exceptional (15-16)</td><td>Exceptional (15-16)</td><td>Exceptional (15-16)</td><td>Exceptional (15-16)</td></tr><tr><th>Treasure:</th><td>Nil</td><td>Nil</td><td>Nil</td><td>Nil</td></tr><tr><th>Alignment:</th><td>Neutral</td><td>Neutral</td><td>Neutral</td><td>Neutral</td></tr><tr><th>No. Appearing:</th><td>1</td><td>1</td><td>1</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><th>Armor Class:</th><td>3</td><td>4</td><td>3</td><td>5</td></tr><tr><th>Movement:</th><td>21</td><td>12, Fl 24 (C)</td><td>15</td><td>15</td></tr><tr><th>Hit Dice:</th><td>15 (122 hp)</td><td>15 (122 hp)</td><td>15 (122 hp)</td><td>15 (122 hp)</td></tr><tr><th>THAC0:</th><td>5</td><td>5</td><td>5</td><td>5</td></tr><tr><th>No. of Attacks:</th><td>See below</td><td>See below</td><td>See below</td><td>See below</td></tr><tr><th>Damage/Attack:</th><td>See below</td><td>See below</td><td>See below</td><td>See below</td></tr><tr><th>Special Attacks:</th><td>Magical weapons,<br>rake, darts</td><td>Dive</td><td>Hypnotism</td><td>Poison</td></tr><tr><th>Special Defenses:</th><td>Danger sense</td><td>Danger sense</td><td>Danger sense,<br>weapon immunity</td><td>Danger sense,<br>weapon immunity</td></tr><tr><th>Magic Resistance:</th><td>50%</td><td>50%</td><td>50%</td><td>50%</td></tr><tr><th>Size:</th><td>See below</td><td>See below</td><td>See below</td><td>See below</td></tr><tr><th>Morale:</th><td>Champion (15-16)</td><td>Champion (15-16)</td><td>Champion (15-16)</td><td>Champion (15-16)</td></tr><tr><th>XP Value:</th><td>18,000</td><td>18,000</td><td>18,000</td><td>18,000</td></tr></table><p class=\"f\">The four animal lords listed above are only examples of the many lords who live in the Beastlands. For each variety of animal there is a corresponding animal lord. For instance, there is a fox lord, an <a href=\"/appendix/owl\">owl</a> lord, a <a href=\"/appendix/horse\">horse</a> lord, and hundreds of other animal lords.</p><p>Animal lords can appear in humanoid or animal form. Their humanoid form encompasses the subtle features of the animal in question, and they are about 6 feet tall. In animal form, they look like the animal over which they have dominion. The <a href=\"/appendix/catgreat\">tiger</a> lord looks like a sleek tiger, the <a href=\"/appendix/badger\">badger</a> lord appears as a badger, and so on.</p><p>All animal lords have a natural telepathy or <i>ESP</i> that is always active, making them impossible to surprise or deceive. They also have a keen danger sense that borders on precognition. In mortal danger the lord is 90% likely to have a <q>had feeling</q> and 25% likely to know exactly what will happen.</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Combat:</b> Each of the animal lords has a unique style of combat depending on the animal over which they have dominion. Their propensity for combat differs with each lord; some are naturally more aggressive than others. For instanced, the <a href=\"/appendix/wolf\">wolf</a> lord is obviously more assertive than the rabbit lord.</p><p>As a rule, specific animal lords approach combat situations as their animal counterparts do: predators attack, whereas herbivores flee. However, some animal lords see themselves as protectors of their subject creatures. The <a href=\"/appendix/camel\">camel</a> lord, for instance, runs with a herd, fighting ferociously when necessary to protect the flight of the camels.</p><p>Attack forms vary as widely as attitude among the animal lords. Listed below are the combat abilities of the four animal lords detailed here. They provide guidelines for the other lords.</p><p>All animal lords have the spell-like abilities <i>anti-magic shell</i> (3 times per day), <i>charm person</i> on any one person affectionate to the lord's animal, <i>plane shift</i>, and <i>teleport</i>.</p><p>Animal lords are immune to all <i>charm</i>-related spells, including spells that compel action (for example, geas). They can summon 2 to 12 animals of the lord's type (three times per day, 100% success). They also have superior senses according to the lord's animal. For example, the hawk lord has excellent eyesight.</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Habitat/Society:</b> Although it is incorrect to call the animal lords immoral, they are amoral, especially when dealing with outside affairs. The animal lords care little for anything but matters directly related to their business. They conduct day-to-day affairs related to the animal over which they hold dominion with little regard for the world around them.</p><p>Even so, the animal lords can benefit other animals or people. If a person or animal enters a lord's territory, the lord often aids the creature to get rid of it rather than let it die. But in other dealings an animal lord can be brutal and uncaring. There is, as they say, no such thing as animal politics.</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Ecology:</b> These immortal spirits are, in a sense, gods to their respective animals. If an animal lord's form is killed, its essence reappears in another of its animals, far away, perhaps even on another plane.</p><p>The driving force of the animal lords is nature, which rules their will. For instance, although the rabbit lord seeks vengeance upon men for destroying the homeland of rabbits, he sheds no tear for a rabbit killed by natural predators. This is the way of nature.</p><h2>Cat Lord</h2><p class=\"f\"><img src=\"/img/spc/catlord.gif\" width=\"300\" height=\"360\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Cat Lord\" style=\"float:left; margin-right:.25em;\">The lord of cats, in her human form, looks like a dark-haired, green eyed human with a lithe form. The one trait that separates her from other humans is her catlike eyes with vertical pupils. In her cat form, she looks loke a black panther with fiery red eyes and fierce strength.</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Combat:</b> In human form the cat lord wields a <i>long sword of wounding</i> with which she can attack twice per round. She also employs <i>darts +2</i> with a +3 bonus to hit because of her Dexterity. She has ten <i>darts</i> at the beginning of any combat.</p><p>When in cat form, the cat lord attacks with two huge paws (each does 1d4 points of damage) and a vicious bite (1d10 points of damage). If both front paws hit, the cat may rake with her two back claws for an additional 1d4 points of damage each.</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Habitat/Society:</b> The cat lord tends to the affairs of felines both in the Inner and Outer Planes. She arrives whenever humans drive cats out of their natural habitat. She also leads prides of cats out of danger by assuming leadership of the pride. Though this may mean killing the current leader of a pride, the lord sees this as a necessary evil for the good of the group.</p><p>Nonfelines see the cat lord in different ways according to their disposition toward cats in general. To cat lovers, the cat lord has a Charisma of 22 and seems attractive. To those indifferent to cats, she has a Charisma of 10 and seems an interesting human. To those who dislike or hate cats, the cat lord has a Charisma of 10 and seems repulsive and intimidating.</p><p>Some view the cat lord as evil, others as good. Neither view is true, for the cat lord does not bother with the affairs of men.</p><h2>Hawk Lord</h2><p class=\"f\"><img src=\"/img/spc/hawklord.gif\" width=\"300\" height=\"360\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Hawk Lord\" style=\"float:right; margin-left:.25em;\">In human form, the <a href=\"/appendix/hawk\">hawk</a> lord is a beautiful, independent-looking woman with charismatic features. She carries herself with confidence and a noble demeanor. In animal form, she is a large hawk with distinctive whi markings and a tremendous wingspan.</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Combat:</b> Of the four animal lords detailed here, the hawk lord fights most weakly in human form. Her THAC0 increases to 20 when human, and she has no proficiency in any weapon. She can cast <i>charm person</i>, as per the wizard spell, seven times per day.</p><p>In animal form, the hawk lord can use her claws (1d6 points of damage) and beak (1d4 points of damage). However, she prefers a plummeting dive from 100 feet or higher. She may not attack with her beak when diving, but her claw attacks gain +2 to hit and do 2d6 points of damage apiece.</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Habitat/Society:</b> The noble hawk lord, unlike most of the animal lords, finds pleasure in dealing with humans. In human form she often walks the fields and meets people.</p><p>The hawk lord deals with the affairs of hawks everywhere. She appears frequently in the Upper Planes and the Prime Material Plane when hawks flee their homeland or are otherwise endangered.</p><h2>Lizard Lord</h2><p class=\"f\"><img src=\"/img/spc/lizlord.gif\" width=\"300\" height=\"360\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Lizard Lord\" style=\"float:left; margin-right:.25em;\">The <a href=\"lizard\">lizard</a> lord is one of the most easily recognized animal lords. He sometimes appears as an imperious human male with the jeweled, beaded skin of a gila monster. In animal form, he appears as a huge gila monster or komodo dragon.</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Combat:</b> In human form the lizard lord rarely uses weapons, preferring instead to depend on his strong <i>hypnotism</i> ability. Creatures meeting the lizard lord's gaze must save vs. spell at a -3 penalty or become susceptible to the lord's suggestions.</p><p>In animal form, the lizard lord may bite for 2d6 points of damage. Any creature bitten on an attack roll of natural 20 takes double damage and is trapped in the animal lord's jaws, thereafter taking normal damage each round until the victim escapes or dies. The lizard lord is also immune to attacks by blunt weapons in this form.</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Habitat/Society:</b> The lizard lord is one of the most aloof animal lords. He rarely takes human form, and even less rarely involves himself in the affairs of nonreptile kind. Usually sedentary, he only infrequently rouses himself out of his torpor, and that only at some great calamity to his people. Once active, however, he is implacable in his anger and desire for vengeance.</p><h2>Wolf Lord</h2><p class=\"f\"><img src=\"/img/spc/wolflord.gif\" width=\"300\" height=\"360\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Wolf Lord\" style=\"float:right; margin-left:.25em;\">The lord of <a href=\"/appendix/wolf\">wolves</a> appears more human than most animal lords, as a teenaged boy with sharp, lupine features, an intelligent face, and eyes bright with life. In animal form, the wolf lord is a gray wolf that leads huge wolf packs.</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Combat:</b> In human form, the wolf lord is a weak fighter. He always transforms into a wolf when entering combat. In human form the lord wields a dagger coated with poison (class E, injected, immediate, death/20). The dagger is so enchanted that when the wolf lord wields it, it never runs dry of poison.</p><p>In animal form, the wolf lord bites twice per round (2d6 points of damage). In animal form the wolf lord is immune to nonmagical weapons.</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Habitat/Society:</b> Even in human form, this strange and alarming lord shows lupine characteristics: He is cunning, wily, and at times brutal.</p><br clear=\"all\" style=\"clear:both; height:0;\">\r\n","images":["<img src=\"grf/ps.gif\" width=\"150\" height=\"75\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Planescape\" title=\"Planescape\" align=\"right\">","<img src=\"img/animlord.gif\" alt=\"Animal Lord\" title=\"Animal Lord\" border=\"0\" width=\"300\" height=\"360\" style=\"text-align:right;\" align=\"right\">","<img src=\"/img/spc/catlord.gif\" width=\"300\" height=\"360\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Cat Lord\" style=\"float:left; margin-right:.25em;\">","<img src=\"/img/spc/hawklord.gif\" width=\"300\" height=\"360\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Hawk Lord\" style=\"float:right; margin-left:.25em;\">","<img src=\"/img/spc/lizlord.gif\" width=\"300\" height=\"360\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Lizard Lord\" style=\"float:left; margin-right:.25em;\">","<img src=\"/img/spc/wolflord.gif\" width=\"300\" height=\"360\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Wolf Lord\" style=\"float:right; margin-left:.25em;\">","<img src=\"grf/add2_01.gif\" width=\"200\" height=\"56\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Advanced Dungeons & Dragons 2nd Edition\">"],"setting":"Planescape","statblock":{"Cat Lord":{"Activity Cycle":"Any","Alignment":"Neutral","Armor Class":"3","Climate/Terrain":"Beastlands","Damage/Attack":"See below","Diet":"Carnivore","Frequency":"Unique","Hit Dice":"15 (122 hp)","Intelligence":"Exceptional (15-16)","Magic Resistance":"50%","Morale":"Champion (15-16)","Movement":"21","No. Appearing":"1","No. of Attacks":"See below","Organization":"Solitary","Size":"See below","Special Attacks":"Magical weapons,<br>rake, darts","Special Defenses":"Danger sense","THAC0":"5","Treasure":"Nil","XP Value":"18,000"},"Hawk Lord":{"Activity Cycle":"Any","Alignment":"Neutral","Armor Class":"4","Climate/Terrain":"Beastlands","Damage/Attack":"See below","Diet":"Carnivore","Frequency":"Unique","Hit Dice":"15 (122 hp)","Intelligence":"Exceptional (15-16)","Magic Resistance":"50%","Morale":"Champion (15-16)","Movement":"12, Fl 24 (C)","No. Appearing":"1","No. of Attacks":"See below","Organization":"Solitary","Size":"See below","Special Attacks":"Dive","Special Defenses":"Danger sense","THAC0":"5","Treasure":"Nil","XP Value":"18,000"},"Lizard Lord":{"Activity Cycle":"Any","Alignment":"Neutral","Armor Class":"3","Climate/Terrain":"Beastlands","Damage/Attack":"See below","Diet":"Carnivore","Frequency":"Unique","Hit Dice":"15 (122 hp)","Intelligence":"Exceptional (15-16)","Magic Resistance":"50%","Morale":"Champion (15-16)","Movement":"15","No. Appearing":"1","No. of Attacks":"See below","Organization":"Solitary","Size":"See below","Special Attacks":"Hypnotism","Special Defenses":"Danger sense,<br>weapon immunity","THAC0":"5","Treasure":"Nil","XP Value":"18,000"},"Wolf Lord":{"Activity Cycle":"Any","Alignment":"Neutral","Armor Class":"5","Climate/Terrain":"Beastlands","Damage/Attack":"See below","Diet":"Carnivore","Frequency":"Unique","Hit Dice":"15 (122 hp)","Intelligence":"Exceptional (15-16)","Magic Resistance":"50%","Morale":"Champion (15-16)","Movement":"15","No. Appearing":"1","No. of Attacks":"See below","Organization":"Solitary","Size":"See below","Special Attacks":"Poison","Special Defenses":"Danger sense,<br>weapon immunity","THAC0":"5","Treasure":"Nil","XP Value":"18,000"}},"title":"Animal Lord"},"sources":["2118","2602"],"statblock_names":[],"title":"Animal Lord","prev_key":"animhoua","next_key":"animus","monster_path":"/appendix/animlord"}},"staticQueryHashes":[],"slicesMap":{}}
