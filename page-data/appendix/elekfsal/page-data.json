While the powers listed above are the most common, some aarakocra have different or additional powers.</p><p class=\"f\">A race of intelligent, birdlike creatures living in the deepest deserts of Athas, the rare Athasian <a href=\"/appendix/aarakocr\">aarakocra</a> spends its time soaring on thermals in search of food.</p><p>The aarakocra is 7 to 8 feet tall with a wingspan of 20 feet or more. Because of its large wingspan, an aarakocra can carry as much as 75% of its own body weight and still fly easily. An aarakocra can fly a short distance carrying a burden equaling 125% of its own body weight. The average body weight of a full grown male is 100 pounds and a female is 85 pounds.</p><p>Each wing has a &ldquo;hand&rdquo; at its midpoint, consisting of three fingers and an opposable thumb. The fourth finger forms the rigid leading edge of the wing. In flight the hands cannot be used, but on the ground the aarakocra can use its hands almost as a human would. The aarakocra's body is protected by a thin bony plate on the chest, much like a solid rib cage. Talons on its legs can be used as claws and can be retracted to reveal a second set of hands, also with three fingers and an opposable thumb. Except for the chest plate, the entire skeleton is hollow and extremely fragile.</p><p>From a distance, the Athasian aarakocra resembles a huge <a href=\"/appendix/bird\">vulture</a>. Its black eyes, set in the front of the head, provide excellent vision over a long range. The plumage is generally black with a white collar for adult males and black or brown with a smaller white collar for females. Adolescents are a mixture of brown and black. The beak is large and covers most of the head. Plumage begins at the crown of the head and is darker near the head, except for the collar. Athasian aarakocra speak their own language and the languages of vultures and other large birds. Some speak the common tongue (5% to 10% chance depending on how deep in the wastelands a tribe lives).</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Combat:</b> Aarakocra can fight in the air or on the ground. They prefer aerial combat since their bones are too fragile to withstand a solid blow from a human-sized opponent. In combat against creatures on the ground, they prefer to fly over their victim and drop weighted nets. Some aarakocra use darts to harass ground-based opponents.</p><p>If their opponents can fly, the aarakocra generally forgo the use of the net, although large groups sometimes use nets on flying creatures. Normally, aarakocra attack flying creatures with long spears, diving from above and allowing the momentum to carry the spear through the target. Such an attack doubles the damage if the aarakocra have been able to dive at least 50 feet. Only the very largest aarakocra can carry more than one of these spears, they can attack with both at once with no penalty, causing double damage on each strike. All diving attacks are made at +4 and should be treated as a charge attack. All other penalties and restrictions of charge attacks apply.</p><p>The effect of the aarakocra's nets depends on if the opponent is flying at the time it becomes entangled. Creatures on the ground that are hit by a net are entangled and unable to participate in any combat until they make a successful Strength check to get free of the net. Flying creatures hit by a net can no longer fly and immediately begin falling. If they cannot escape the net or use some magical means to arrest the fall, normal falling damage applies.</p><p>Unless victims are entangled in nets, aarakocra are cautious in ground combat. If the aarakocra outnumber their opponents they advance in a straight line and thrust with their spears. If outnumbered, or the opponents are particularly tough, the aarakocra withdraw. Victims entangled in nets are killed or incapacitated for use as food or ransom.</p><p>Athasian aarakocra are mindful of their physical limitations as well as their comparatively low psionic abilities. They do not normally initiate psionic combat. At the first sign of psionic powers from any of their victims, however, all aarakocra that have some ability will use whatever attack and defense modes they can in an attempt to destroy the threat. Large groups of is or more aarakocra may initiate psionic combat if their leaders feel they can win quickly and avoid physical combat.</p><p>In desperation, an aarakocra can attempt to bite an opponent in combat. Because of the unwieldiness of its beak, the aarakocra has a THAC0 of 18 if attacking with this appendage. Further, the birdman causes only 1d2 points of damage with the beak.</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Habitat/Society:</b> Athasian aarakocra live in tribes with 6-20 (2d8+4) members, depending on the prestige of the leader. The largest tribe ever recorded had 50 members. The tribal hunting territory depends on the size of the tribe, usually about 500 square miles for a tribe of 10 members. There are no rigid boundaries between tribes and border disputes are not uncommon.</p><p>Alignments of tribe members are similar to the alignment of the leader. A tribe that has a leader who is neutral good may have neutral good, chaotic good, lawful good, and true neutral members. A predominantly evil tribe does not recognize boundaries with other tribes and treats other tribes as inferior beings to be eliminated.</p><p>Athasian aarakocra aren't happy in enclosed spaces, but they they take refuge in a cave or building if necessary.</p><p>Nonevil tribes live in rocky aeries in the highest peaks they can find. Evil tribes are normally nomadic and use an aerie made by another tribe if they need to remain in an area for a long time, even if they have to evict the tribe that made the nest.</p><p>Aarakocra aren't friendly toward intruders in their territory, especially caravans. They try to extract a toll from the caravan for passage through the desert. Good-aligned tribes allow unhindered passage of caravans that pay a tribute. If someone refuses to pay the tribute, the aarakocra try to capture scouts or outriders from the party and hold them until an even larger tribute is paid. The payment may be either livestock or shiny objects. Aarakocra are smart enough not to be taken in by glass baubles instead of gems, although they cannot tell the difference between the more common gems and the rare ones.</p><p>Evil tribes ask for tribute and often attack a caravan whether it pays or not. Aarakocra always demand shiny objects such as stones. These tribes find humans and demihumans to be quite tasty and prefer them to other food.</p><p>Good-aligned tribes of aarakocra sometimes return a lost traveler to the edge of the desert after first removing any valuables the traveler may be carrying. On very rare occasions a tribe might return a lost group of travelers to the more frequently traveled parts of the desert, again after first taking any valuables as payment.</p><p>The oldest male is the leader of the tribal hunting party and has 4+4 Hit Dice. The oldest female is in charge of the tribal aerie and has 3+3 HD. In tribes that have more than 15 members, the next oldest aarakocra serves as shaman and has 3+3 HD; the shaman completes the triumvirate necessary for proper worship and the summoning of elementals. (Interestingly, no magic-using aarakocra has ever been recorded.) Tribes without a shaman cannot summon <a href=\"/appendix/element1\">air elementals</a>, which is an important part of aarakocra culture.</p><p>The shaman is the leader of the daily sun worship. Aarakocra worship the sun because it provides them with the thermals they need to soar in search of food. The shaman also leads the mystic rituals used to summon an air elemental. Summoning an air elemental is usually done only in preparation for the tribe's most sacred ceremony, the hunt. Small tribes must band together for this ceremony to allow the triumvirate to be formed.</p><p>The ceremony to summon an air elemental must be conducted at dawn and requires the oldest male and female to emit a highpitched keening whistle. The shaman conducts an intricate dance around them, simultaneously chanting an ancient summoning mantra.</p><p>The hunt is the final part of the initiation of adolescent aarakocra to adulthood and often takes the tribe far from their normal teritory. The target is always a <a href=\"/appendix/drakalsi\">silt drake</a>. The hunt is the only time the females leave the relative safety of the nest. Even an evil tribe will not interfere with a tribe on a hunt. An air elemental is often summoned to help find the drake, but never takes part in the actual combat. Although the adult members of the tribe take part in the initial phases of the combat, it is the initiates who deliver the final, killing blows to me drake. Scars from the hunt are considered a mark of pride among all aarakocra.</p><p>The females spend about eight months of the year incubating their eggs. Athasian aarakocra mate for life and a pair normally produces as many as 10 offspring. A female lays one egg a year. Constant incubation is not required because of the high daytime temperatures, so the females can maintain the nest and keep the tribe's treasure in order.</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Ecology:</b> Athasian aarakocra are high on the food chain and have no natural enemies other than <a href=\"/appendix/drakatha\">drakes</a>. Unless evil, aarakocra leave their own territory only to hunt the silt drake and return as soon as possible when the hunt is over. (Evil aarakocra attack others, as noted above.) Aarakocra eggs and hatchlings are sought after by wealthy land owners who wish to use the creatures as scouts and sentries. An egg can bring as much as 10 cp in Tyr's marketplace. Tribes that have had eggs or hatchlings stolen have long memories and sometimes take revenge against the thief at a later date. Captive aarakocra join any tribe they come in contact with.</p><p>Athasian aarakocra have a natural life span of 21-30 years.</p><br clear=\"all\" style=\"clear:both; height:0;\">\r\n","images":["<img src=\"grf/ds.gif\" width=\"150\" height=\"75\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Dark Sun\" title=\"Dark Sun\" align=\"right\">","<img src=\"img/aarakath.gif\" alt=\"Aarakocra (Athas)\" title=\"Aarakocra (Athas)\" border=\"0\" width=\"300\" height=\"360\" style=\"text-align:right;\" align=\"right\">","<img src=\"grf/add2_01.gif\" width=\"200\" height=\"56\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Advanced Dungeons & Dragons 2nd Edition\">"],"setting":"Dark Sun","statblock":{"Aarakocra (Athas)":{"Activity Cycle":"Day","Alignment":"Any","Armor Class":"7","Climate/Terrain":"Deep desert","Damage/Attack":"1d3/1d3 or by weapon","Diet":"Carnivore","Frequency":"Rare","Hit Dice":"2+2","Intelligence":"Average (8-10)","Magic Resistance":"Nil","Morale":"Steady (11)","Movement":"6, Fl 36 (C)","No. Appearing":"1d10","No. of Attacks":"2","Organization":"Tribal","Size":"M (20'+ wingspan)","Special Attacks":"Nil","Special Defenses":"Nil","THAC0":"17","Treasure":"Varies","XP Value":"65"}},"title":"Aarakocra (Athas)"},"sources":["2433"],"statblock_names":[],"title":"Aarakocra (Athas)","prev_key":"zygraat","next_key":"aarakocr","monster_path":"/appendix/aarakath"}}},"pageContext":{"monster_key":"elekfsal","monster_data":{"TSR":["2635"],"fullBody":"  <table cellspacing=\"0\" cellpadding=\"0\"><tr class=\"bk\"><th> </th><th class=\"cn\">Lesser</th><th class=\"cn\">Noble</th></tr><tr><th>Climate/Terrain:</th><td>Plane of Fire</td><td>Plane of Fire</td></tr><tr><th>Frequency:</th><td>Uncommon</td><td>Very rare</td></tr><tr><th>Organization:</th><td>Pack</td><td>Solitary</td></tr><tr><th>Activity Cycle:</th><td>Any</td><td>Any</td></tr><tr><th>Diet:</th><td>Omnivore</td><td>Omnivore</td></tr><tr><th>Intelligence:</th><td>Average (8-10)</td><td>Genius (17-18)</td></tr><tr><th>Treasure:</th><td>K,M</td><td>G</td></tr><tr><th>Alignment:</th><td>Neutral evil</td><td>Lawful evil</td></tr><tr><th>No. Appearing:</th><td>3d6</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><th>Armor Class:</th><td>8</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><th>Movement:</th><td>12</td><td>18</td></tr><tr><th>Hit Dice:</th><td>2+2</td><td>12</td></tr><tr><th>THAC0:</th><td>19</td><td>9</td></tr><tr><th>No. of Attacks:</th><td>1</td><td>2</td></tr><tr><th>Damage/Attack:</th><td>By weapon</td><td>By weapon +4, 2d8+4</td></tr><tr><th>Special Attacks:</th><td>+2 heat dmg</td><td>+1d6 heat dmg</td></tr><tr><th>Special Defenses:</th><td>See below</td><td>See below</td></tr><tr><th>Magic Resistance:</th><td>Nil</td><td>25%</td></tr><tr><th>Size:</th><td>M (6' long)</td><td>L (10' long)</td></tr><tr><th>Morale:</th><td>Average (8-10)</td><td>Fanatic (17-18)</td></tr><tr><th>XP Value:</th><td>175</td><td>10,000</td></tr></table><p class=\"f\">Most folks have heard of salamanders - the creatures appear more frequently than a body'd think, even off the Elemental Plane of Fire - but few really know the dark of them. See, the creatures've got a fairly complex life cycle.</p><p>They start their existence in a larval stage, during which time they're called <a href=\"/appendix/elekfire\">fire snakes</a>. The name was bestowed by some prime long ago, and unfortunately, it stuck. Some fire snakes eventually mature into what're called lesser salamanders, while others remain as they are until they die. No one knows why this occurs.</p><p>Lesser salamanders aren't spotted often by most bashers, as they rarely leave their home plane. However, experienced planewalkers know that Fire's thick with the monsters. Some, but not all, grow and develop into <a href=\"/appendix/elekfire\">normal salamanders</a>. Only one in a hundred thousand of these creatures has the potential to develop further. These special bloods, if they manage to survive for at least a thousand years, become salamander nobles. This name derives not only from their societal position as leaders, but also from their personal power - nobles're mighty foes in combat.</p><p><b>Note:</b> This entry describes only lesser salamanders and nobles. For more information on fire snakes and normal salamanders, refer to the <a href=\"/appendix/elekfire\">Elemental, Fire Kin</a> entry.</p><h2>Lesser Salamander</h2><p class=\"f\">Lesser salamanders, sometimes called flamebrothers, are fairly bestial in nature, possessing only the civilization imposed upon them by their more sophisticated superiors.</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Combat:</b> Lesser salamanders use iron weapons in combat. Many wield spears, but others brandish swords, axes, daggers, or maces, all forged entirely of red-hot iron. The body heat of a flamebrother inflicts an additional 2 points of damage upon those struck by its weapon.</p><p>Lesser salamanders are immune to fire-based attacks, and <i>sleep</i>, <i>hold</i>, and <i>charm</i> spells. Cold-based attacks inflict 1 additional point of damage per damage die.</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Habitat/Society:</b> These creatures of fire and heat dwell in flame-filled caverns on their home plane. They're usually encountered in huge numbers, often led by a normal salamander. Powerful creatures of the plane of Fire, such as <a href=\"/appendix/genie\">efreet</a> or intelligent elementals, sometimes put lesser salamanders to work as personal guards or soldiers in their armies. Vast nations of flamebrothers may be ruled by many normal salamanders, with a single salamander noble sitting above them all.</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Ecology:</b> In the hierarchy of the plane of Fire, lesser salamanders find themselves somewhere near the very bottom. They're the front-line skirmishers - in other words, the fodder - in the armies of the plane. Many spend their days tending the deep pits of flame where the larval salamanders (fire snakes) grow to maturity.</p><h2>Salamander Noble</h2><p class=\"f\">Enormous armies and huge kingdoms of salamanders (both lesser and normal) serve the nobles of the race, as do most other creatures of heat and flame. Occasionally, however, these formidable bloods wander about alone, even traveling to other planes. Chant is these plane-hoppers are really exiles, banished for their transgressions. Others believe that they simply search for means and methods of seizing more power and that the wandering salamander nobles are free to return to their home at any time. Both theories sound plausible.</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Combat:</b> Like their lessers, salamander nobles favor fighting with metal spears, which're often enchanted with at least a +2 or +3 bonus. The nobles' great strength adds another 4 points to the damage caused by the spears. And to make matters even worse, the great heat generated by the creatures' bodies inflicts an additional 1d6 points of fire damage to any berk struck by theyr weapons. If unarmed, a noble can grab a sod with its tail and constrict him, inflicting 2d8+4 points of damage per round, plus another 1d6 points due to its body heat.</p><p>Salamander nobles can be struck only by weapons of +2 or better enchantment. They're immune to heat as well as <i>sleep</i>, <i>charm</i>, and <i>hold</i> spells. However, they can also resist the harmful effects of hated cold, so unlike other salamanders, they suffer only normal amounts of damage from such attacks.</p><p>Furthermore, these masters of fire wield potent spellcasting abilities. They can cast each of the following spells three times per day as 10th-level wizards: <i>affect normal fires</i>, <i>burning hands</i>, <i>fireball</i>, <i>flame arrow</i>, <i>flaming sphere</i>, and <i>wall of fire</i>. Once each day, a salamander noble can cast <i>conjure fire elemental</i> and a special form of dispel magic that robs a fire-resistant creature of this protection for 2d4 rounds. This spell negates <i>rings of fire resistance</i>, <i>protection from fire spells</i>, and even the natural resistance of creatures not native to the plane of Fire (such as fiends, <a href=\"/appendix/dragcred\">red dragons</a>, and so on). It doesn't work against <a href=\"/appendix/element2\">fire elementals</a> or other creatures native to the plane. Obviously, if cast on a plane-walking sod who's using special protections to pass safely through the Elemental Plane of Fire, it almost certainly spells his doom.</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Habitat/Society:</b> Salamander nobles recognize no authority above their own. They do their best to ignore beings like <a href=\"/appendix/archomee\">Imix</a> or <a href=\"/appendix/archomeg\">Zaaman Rul</a>, and they stay out of the way of powers on the plane of Fire. Some fiery creatures - including certain elementals, <a href=\"/appendix/elegharg\">grue</a>, <a href=\"/appendix/elekfaze\">azer</a>, <a href=\"/appendix/mephit\">mephits</a>, <a href=\"/appendix/hellhoun\">hell hounds</a>, and <a href=\"/appendix/firemini\">fire minions</a> - look upon the nobles as masters. The efreet, as a rule, hate the salamander nobles but grudgingly respect their strength.</p><p>Despite all their underlings, these powerful bloods are true loners. Since they're not a race unto themselves, they don't take mates or raise young. Lesser salamanders fear them too much to give them anything but blind obedience. If life as a salamander noble has any drawbacks, it's that the tyrant has no confidants, companions, or real allies - only servants.</p><p>Most nobles live in fabulous fortresses or palaces on the Elemcntal Plane of Fire. Each is a unique individual with a very different dwelling and personality. But one thing a berk can count on is that all salamander nobles are cruel masters that spend a great deal of time and energy imposing order and organization upon their chaotic lessers.</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Ecology:</b> Salamander nobles are among the more powerful creatures on the Elemental Plane of Fire. Their life spans have virtually no limit.</p><br clear=\"all\" style=\"clear:both; height:0;\">\r\n","images":["<img src=\"grf/ps.gif\" width=\"150\" height=\"75\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Planescape\" title=\"Planescape\" align=\"right\">","<img src=\"img/elekfsal.gif\" alt=\"Elemental, Fire Kin, Salamander II\" title=\"Elemental, Fire Kin, Salamander II\" border=\"0\" width=\"300\" height=\"360\" style=\"text-align:right;\" align=\"right\">","<img src=\"grf/add2_01.gif\" width=\"200\" height=\"56\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Advanced Dungeons & Dragons 2nd Edition\">"],"setting":"Planescape","statblock":{"Lesser":{"Activity Cycle":"Any","Alignment":"Neutral evil","Armor Class":"8","Climate/Terrain":"Plane of Fire","Damage/Attack":"By weapon","Diet":"Omnivore","Frequency":"Uncommon","Hit Dice":"2+2","Intelligence":"Average (8-10)","Magic Resistance":"Nil","Morale":"Average (8-10)","Movement":"12","No. Appearing":"3d6","No. of Attacks":"1","Organization":"Pack","Size":"M (6' long)","Special Attacks":"+2 heat dmg","Special Defenses":"See below","THAC0":"19","Treasure":"K,M","XP Value":"175"},"Noble":{"Activity Cycle":"Any","Alignment":"Lawful evil","Armor Class":"0","Climate/Terrain":"Plane of Fire","Damage/Attack":"By weapon +4, 2d8+4","Diet":"Omnivore","Frequency":"Very rare","Hit Dice":"12","Intelligence":"Genius (17-18)","Magic Resistance":"25%","Morale":"Fanatic (17-18)","Movement":"18","No. Appearing":"1","No. of Attacks":"2","Organization":"Solitary","Size":"L (10' long)","Special Attacks":"+1d6 heat dmg","Special Defenses":"See below","THAC0":"9","Treasure":"G","XP Value":"10,000"}},"title":"Elemental, Fire Kin, Salamander II"},"sources":["2635"],"statblock_names":[],"title":"Elemental, Fire Kin, Salamander II","prev_key":"elekfire","next_key":"elekftgu","monster_path":"/appendix/elekfsal"}},"staticQueryHashes":[],"slicesMap":{}}
