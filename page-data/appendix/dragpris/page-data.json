While the powers listed above are the most common, some aarakocra have different or additional powers.</p><p class=\"f\">A race of intelligent, birdlike creatures living in the deepest deserts of Athas, the rare Athasian <a href=\"/appendix/aarakocr\">aarakocra</a> spends its time soaring on thermals in search of food.</p><p>The aarakocra is 7 to 8 feet tall with a wingspan of 20 feet or more. Because of its large wingspan, an aarakocra can carry as much as 75% of its own body weight and still fly easily. An aarakocra can fly a short distance carrying a burden equaling 125% of its own body weight. The average body weight of a full grown male is 100 pounds and a female is 85 pounds.</p><p>Each wing has a &ldquo;hand&rdquo; at its midpoint, consisting of three fingers and an opposable thumb. The fourth finger forms the rigid leading edge of the wing. In flight the hands cannot be used, but on the ground the aarakocra can use its hands almost as a human would. The aarakocra's body is protected by a thin bony plate on the chest, much like a solid rib cage. Talons on its legs can be used as claws and can be retracted to reveal a second set of hands, also with three fingers and an opposable thumb. Except for the chest plate, the entire skeleton is hollow and extremely fragile.</p><p>From a distance, the Athasian aarakocra resembles a huge <a href=\"/appendix/bird\">vulture</a>. Its black eyes, set in the front of the head, provide excellent vision over a long range. The plumage is generally black with a white collar for adult males and black or brown with a smaller white collar for females. Adolescents are a mixture of brown and black. The beak is large and covers most of the head. Plumage begins at the crown of the head and is darker near the head, except for the collar. Athasian aarakocra speak their own language and the languages of vultures and other large birds. Some speak the common tongue (5% to 10% chance depending on how deep in the wastelands a tribe lives).</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Combat:</b> Aarakocra can fight in the air or on the ground. They prefer aerial combat since their bones are too fragile to withstand a solid blow from a human-sized opponent. In combat against creatures on the ground, they prefer to fly over their victim and drop weighted nets. Some aarakocra use darts to harass ground-based opponents.</p><p>If their opponents can fly, the aarakocra generally forgo the use of the net, although large groups sometimes use nets on flying creatures. Normally, aarakocra attack flying creatures with long spears, diving from above and allowing the momentum to carry the spear through the target. Such an attack doubles the damage if the aarakocra have been able to dive at least 50 feet. Only the very largest aarakocra can carry more than one of these spears, they can attack with both at once with no penalty, causing double damage on each strike. All diving attacks are made at +4 and should be treated as a charge attack. All other penalties and restrictions of charge attacks apply.</p><p>The effect of the aarakocra's nets depends on if the opponent is flying at the time it becomes entangled. Creatures on the ground that are hit by a net are entangled and unable to participate in any combat until they make a successful Strength check to get free of the net. Flying creatures hit by a net can no longer fly and immediately begin falling. If they cannot escape the net or use some magical means to arrest the fall, normal falling damage applies.</p><p>Unless victims are entangled in nets, aarakocra are cautious in ground combat. If the aarakocra outnumber their opponents they advance in a straight line and thrust with their spears. If outnumbered, or the opponents are particularly tough, the aarakocra withdraw. Victims entangled in nets are killed or incapacitated for use as food or ransom.</p><p>Athasian aarakocra are mindful of their physical limitations as well as their comparatively low psionic abilities. They do not normally initiate psionic combat. At the first sign of psionic powers from any of their victims, however, all aarakocra that have some ability will use whatever attack and defense modes they can in an attempt to destroy the threat. Large groups of is or more aarakocra may initiate psionic combat if their leaders feel they can win quickly and avoid physical combat.</p><p>In desperation, an aarakocra can attempt to bite an opponent in combat. Because of the unwieldiness of its beak, the aarakocra has a THAC0 of 18 if attacking with this appendage. Further, the birdman causes only 1d2 points of damage with the beak.</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Habitat/Society:</b> Athasian aarakocra live in tribes with 6-20 (2d8+4) members, depending on the prestige of the leader. The largest tribe ever recorded had 50 members. The tribal hunting territory depends on the size of the tribe, usually about 500 square miles for a tribe of 10 members. There are no rigid boundaries between tribes and border disputes are not uncommon.</p><p>Alignments of tribe members are similar to the alignment of the leader. A tribe that has a leader who is neutral good may have neutral good, chaotic good, lawful good, and true neutral members. A predominantly evil tribe does not recognize boundaries with other tribes and treats other tribes as inferior beings to be eliminated.</p><p>Athasian aarakocra aren't happy in enclosed spaces, but they they take refuge in a cave or building if necessary.</p><p>Nonevil tribes live in rocky aeries in the highest peaks they can find. Evil tribes are normally nomadic and use an aerie made by another tribe if they need to remain in an area for a long time, even if they have to evict the tribe that made the nest.</p><p>Aarakocra aren't friendly toward intruders in their territory, especially caravans. They try to extract a toll from the caravan for passage through the desert. Good-aligned tribes allow unhindered passage of caravans that pay a tribute. If someone refuses to pay the tribute, the aarakocra try to capture scouts or outriders from the party and hold them until an even larger tribute is paid. The payment may be either livestock or shiny objects. Aarakocra are smart enough not to be taken in by glass baubles instead of gems, although they cannot tell the difference between the more common gems and the rare ones.</p><p>Evil tribes ask for tribute and often attack a caravan whether it pays or not. Aarakocra always demand shiny objects such as stones. These tribes find humans and demihumans to be quite tasty and prefer them to other food.</p><p>Good-aligned tribes of aarakocra sometimes return a lost traveler to the edge of the desert after first removing any valuables the traveler may be carrying. On very rare occasions a tribe might return a lost group of travelers to the more frequently traveled parts of the desert, again after first taking any valuables as payment.</p><p>The oldest male is the leader of the tribal hunting party and has 4+4 Hit Dice. The oldest female is in charge of the tribal aerie and has 3+3 HD. In tribes that have more than 15 members, the next oldest aarakocra serves as shaman and has 3+3 HD; the shaman completes the triumvirate necessary for proper worship and the summoning of elementals. (Interestingly, no magic-using aarakocra has ever been recorded.) Tribes without a shaman cannot summon <a href=\"/appendix/element1\">air elementals</a>, which is an important part of aarakocra culture.</p><p>The shaman is the leader of the daily sun worship. Aarakocra worship the sun because it provides them with the thermals they need to soar in search of food. The shaman also leads the mystic rituals used to summon an air elemental. Summoning an air elemental is usually done only in preparation for the tribe's most sacred ceremony, the hunt. Small tribes must band together for this ceremony to allow the triumvirate to be formed.</p><p>The ceremony to summon an air elemental must be conducted at dawn and requires the oldest male and female to emit a highpitched keening whistle. The shaman conducts an intricate dance around them, simultaneously chanting an ancient summoning mantra.</p><p>The hunt is the final part of the initiation of adolescent aarakocra to adulthood and often takes the tribe far from their normal teritory. The target is always a <a href=\"/appendix/drakalsi\">silt drake</a>. The hunt is the only time the females leave the relative safety of the nest. Even an evil tribe will not interfere with a tribe on a hunt. An air elemental is often summoned to help find the drake, but never takes part in the actual combat. Although the adult members of the tribe take part in the initial phases of the combat, it is the initiates who deliver the final, killing blows to me drake. Scars from the hunt are considered a mark of pride among all aarakocra.</p><p>The females spend about eight months of the year incubating their eggs. Athasian aarakocra mate for life and a pair normally produces as many as 10 offspring. A female lays one egg a year. Constant incubation is not required because of the high daytime temperatures, so the females can maintain the nest and keep the tribe's treasure in order.</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Ecology:</b> Athasian aarakocra are high on the food chain and have no natural enemies other than <a href=\"/appendix/drakatha\">drakes</a>. Unless evil, aarakocra leave their own territory only to hunt the silt drake and return as soon as possible when the hunt is over. (Evil aarakocra attack others, as noted above.) Aarakocra eggs and hatchlings are sought after by wealthy land owners who wish to use the creatures as scouts and sentries. An egg can bring as much as 10 cp in Tyr's marketplace. Tribes that have had eggs or hatchlings stolen have long memories and sometimes take revenge against the thief at a later date. Captive aarakocra join any tribe they come in contact with.</p><p>Athasian aarakocra have a natural life span of 21-30 years.</p><br clear=\"all\" style=\"clear:both; height:0;\">\r\n","images":["<img src=\"grf/ds.gif\" width=\"150\" height=\"75\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Dark Sun\" title=\"Dark Sun\" align=\"right\">","<img src=\"img/aarakath.gif\" alt=\"Aarakocra (Athas)\" title=\"Aarakocra (Athas)\" border=\"0\" width=\"300\" height=\"360\" style=\"text-align:right;\" align=\"right\">","<img src=\"grf/add2_01.gif\" width=\"200\" height=\"56\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Advanced Dungeons & Dragons 2nd Edition\">"],"setting":"Dark Sun","statblock":{"Aarakocra (Athas)":{"Activity Cycle":"Day","Alignment":"Any","Armor Class":"7","Climate/Terrain":"Deep desert","Damage/Attack":"1d3/1d3 or by weapon","Diet":"Carnivore","Frequency":"Rare","Hit Dice":"2+2","Intelligence":"Average (8-10)","Magic Resistance":"Nil","Morale":"Steady (11)","Movement":"6, Fl 36 (C)","No. Appearing":"1d10","No. of Attacks":"2","Organization":"Tribal","Size":"M (20'+ wingspan)","Special Attacks":"Nil","Special Defenses":"Nil","THAC0":"17","Treasure":"Varies","XP Value":"65"}},"title":"Aarakocra (Athas)"},"sources":["2433"],"statblock_names":[],"title":"Aarakocra (Athas)","prev_key":"zygraat","next_key":"aarakocr","monster_path":"/appendix/aarakath"}}},"pageContext":{"monster_key":"dragpris","monster_data":{"TSR":["2173"],"fullBody":"  <table cellspacing=\"0\" cellpadding=\"0\"><tr><th>Climate/Terrain:</th><td>Temperate or tropical</td></tr><tr><th>Frequency:</th><td>Very rare</td></tr><tr><th>Organization:</th><td>Solitary (clan)</td></tr><tr><th>Activity Cycle:</th><td>Day</td></tr><tr><th>Diet:</th><td>Omnivore</td></tr><tr><th>Intelligence:</th><td>High (13-14)</td></tr><tr><th>Treasure:</th><td>See below</td></tr><tr><th>Alignment:</th><td>Chaotic neutral</td></tr><tr><th>No. Appearing:</th><td>1 (2-4)</td></tr><tr><th>Armor Class:</th><td>0 (base)</td></tr><tr><th>Movement:</th><td>9, Fl 30 (C), Sw 12</td></tr><tr><th>Hit Dice:</th><td>11 (base)</td></tr><tr><th>THAC0:</th><td>9 (base)</td></tr><tr><th>No. of Attacks:</th><td>3 + special</td></tr><tr><th>Damage/Attack:</th><td>1d6+1/1d6+1/1d20+2</td></tr><tr><th>Special Attacks:</th><td>Breath weapon, spells, special</td></tr><tr><th>Special Defenses:</th><td>Fear</td></tr><tr><th>Magic Resistance:</th><td>Varies</td></tr><tr><th>Size:</th><td>G (30' base length)</td></tr><tr><th>Morale:</th><td>Fanatic (17-18)</td></tr><tr><th>XP Value:</th><td>Varies</td></tr></table><p class=\"f\">Prismatic <a href=\"/appendix/dragon\">dragons</a> are closely related to the gem dragons, although some of their characteristics, and their almost superstitious reverence for <a href=\"/appendix/dragmcop\">copper dragons</a> suggest that they are somehow related to that subspecies as well. While all dragons tend to be greedy and self-important, prismatic dragons are extremely so. Sustained flattery and gifts of precious metals and gems can often influence and cloud the judgment of a prismatic dragon. A gift that exploits the dragon's boundless vanity, such as a mirror or a song exalting its wisdom and beauty can make this creature forget almost any wrong done to it.</p><p>While not evil, the prismatic dragon quickly grows impatient with talk that is not of immediate interest to it. Such banter is silenced in the most expedient manner, typically with a spell or fierce tail slap.</p><p>At birth, their scales are blight, mirrorlike silver except for several distinct bands of color at its midsection - red, orange, yellow, green, blue, and purple. Over time, the colors spread and fade, and the shiny scaled give way to pastel hues with dazzling refractive qualities (much like a holographic image). As its natural colors fade, the dragon gains great control over its shimmering scales. By the <i>adult</i> age, the scales are a homogeneous translucent blue-gray, with patches or bands of color confined to wing tips, claws, and face. A basic hypnotic pattern power develops that increases with age - <i>great wyrms</i> can make themselves virtually invisible and can project complex illusions simply by manipulating their scales.</p><p>Prismatic dragons speak their own language, which is both intelligible to speakers of the copper dragon tongue. They do not share a common language with other dragons, though many can converse with any intelligent creature (the chance for this is 10% + 5% per age category).</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Combat:</b> A prismatic dragon prefers to use its breath weapon or spells to kill, wound, or incapacitate its enemies, lest it run the risk (however slight) of having the beauty of its magnificent hide diminished by the weapons of &ldquo;mortal pests&rdquo;. Insulting words or deeds may, however, cause these hot-tempered creatures to attack with abandon. Prismatic dragons eschew enchantment/charm spells as unnecessary for creatures as awesome as themselves. Conjuration/summoning and Alteration spells are much more to their liking.</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Breath Weapon:</b> The breath weapon is a cloud of gas, 10 feet high and 30 feet in diameter, that rolls forward 10 feet per round, dispersing in a number of rounds equal to the dragon's age category. This cloud contains swirling patterns of sparkling particles and bright, interweaving colors. In illumination of torch brightness or better, those who view the cloud must save vs. spell) or be affected as if by a rainbow pattern spell (Wisdom bonuses apply; dwarf and halfling Constitution bonuses and the illusionist specialty bonus to saving throws do not). Even the dragon itself can be affected by the hypnotic properties of the cloud; a prismatic dragon below <i>adult</i> age is enthralled on a roll of 1 on 1d20 for a round, checking once per round until it shakes off the effect.</p><p>The breath weapon itself transmutes water into a milky, luminous solid matter similar to mother-of-pearl. Although the material is not ice and does not melt, it does evaporate under the same conditions as liquid water; exposed to air or sunlight, a mass of this material will eventually dissolve. While solid, the water has the same saving throws as wood of the same thickness. When the gas cloud contacts a stream, river, lake, or similar body of water, the water solidifies to a depth of one-half inch per age category of the dragon (3 inches for an adult, age category 6).</p><p>Water-based creatures such as <a href=\"/appendix/elekwwwe\">water weirds</a> and <a href=\"/appendix/element2\">elementals</a> must save vs. breath weapon or die. A surviving creature suffers 1d12 points of damage per age category and is <i>slowed</i> for 1d4 turns. The creature's physical attack damage is increased by 50% for as long as it is <i>slowed</i>.</p><p>Creatures with a high water content (such as humans and demihumans) are also vulnerable to the breath weapon. The gas permeates their skin, making it crack and flake away like peeling bark, and causing severe trauma to organs and muscles. This has three effects (modified by a saving throw):</p><ul><li>Initial exposure to the gas causes 4d6 damage. Prolonged exposure does not inflict additional damage.</li><li>The equivalent of a <i>slow</i> spell for one round per age category of the dragon.</li><li>Additional damage while slowed: strenuous activity (running, melee) inflicts 1d8 per round, moderate activity (spellcasting, walking, firing a bow) inflicts 1d8-4 points of damage. No damage or negative damage means that a cast spell is not disrupted by pain.</li></ul><p>A successful saving throw vs. breath weapon halves the initial damage and duration of the <i>slow</i> effect, but does not affect the additional damage of straining traumatized muscles.</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Special Tactics:</b> Prismatic dragons often lie in ambush in a lake or deep river, using their wings or <i>waveform</i> power (achieved at <i>juvenile</i> age) to drench prey. If a drenched prey fails a saving throw against the breath weapon, all saturated clothing, hair, and so on hardens into a solid shell, much like a body cast. The shell must be broken before the victim can move again.</p><p>Wet surfaces that do not absorb water well (bare skin, leather, metal) will receive only a thin coating, as easily broken as an egg shell. Most people will have no trouble moving their hands or speaking.</p><p>Absorbent surfaces, such as normal clothing, must be shattered. A successful bend bars roll cracks the shell on one limb sufficiently to allow movement. An immobilized, statue-like victim can tip himself over, shattering the shell if it fails to save vs. crushing blow. No amount of tapping from within the shell can break it. A solid blow against AC 6 frees one limb or the torso if the shell fails its saving throw vs. crushing blow. The shell absorbs 5 points of damage, the rest affects the trapped victim. When one part of the shell shatters, the shell covering an adjacent limb is 50% likely to shatter as well.</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Special Abilities:</b> Prismatic dragons are not born with any special abilities, but soon develop formidable powers.</p><p><i>Very young:</i> They can manipulate the color of their scales to produce a <i>color spray</i> effect once per day; <i>Juvenile: Waveform</i>, three times per day (molds a 20-foot cube of water per level into various forms, such as enormous waves; on solidified water this acts as a <i>stoneshape</i> spell); <i>Adult: Hypnotic pattern</i> twice per day, even while otherwise attacking or spellcasting; <i>Old: Camouflage</i> ability, 50% invisible, plus 10% per age category beyond old; <i>Venerable:</i> Illusionist spell effects: <i>change self</i>, <i>mislead</i>, <i>displace</i> (as <i>cloak of displacement</i>), <i>spectral force</i>, <i>hallucinatory terrain</i>, and <i>vacancy</i>; to a total of 20 rounds per day; <i>Great wyrm:</i> All of the above powers at will.</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Habitat/Society:</b> Most prismatic dragons come from an uncharted island in a tropical sea, where dozens of their kind live in an anarchic but rarely violent society. Here, power and prestige are won by competitions of magic, innate powers, and physical beauty. At the center of the island is a huge volcanic crater lined win immense crystals and precious gems. Away from the island, when more than one prismatic dragon is encountered, it is invariable a mother and young, not a mated pair. Prismatic dragon eggs are pale pink to yellow, with many copper flecks.</p><p>According to the legends of prismatic dragons, they and all other gem dragon species originated on the island. They say that the Creator Dragon (often described as a copper Great Wyrm) carved the gem dragons from the native consuls of the island and breathed life into them. As she dug deeper, the Creator Dragon found increasingly precious gems from which to shape her likeness. Eventually, she found the most precious and beautiful crystal she had ever seen. The other gems - <a href=\"/appendix/drageeme\">emerald</a>, <a href=\"/appendix/dragesap\">sapphire</a>, <a href=\"/appendix/dragmyru\">ruby</a>, diamond - were flat and ugly by comparison, so the Creator Dragon threw those dragons into the sea to drown. However, some escaped their fate, and their descendants now live a wrongful existence against her will. From this most beautiful gem, the Creator Dragon carved the first prismatic dragon and gave it life with her last breath.</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Ecology:</b> Like most dragons, prismatic dragons can eat almost anything. They prefer, however, to hunt and eat large fish and marine mammals, washing down their meal with quartz and sometimes cleansing the palate with some silver. In general, prismatic dragons consider the gem dragons their enemies, and use lesser species (like humans) to destroy them.</p><p>Strangely, prismatic dragons never mate on their home island, so young adults are encouraged to go out into the world. Females are welcomed back only if they return with young, but males may never return.</p><p>Every 20 to 22 years, a prismatic dragon female (<i>young adult</i> to <i>very old</i>) living abroad is overwhelmed by her mating instincts. The urge is very strong for she can mate successfully for only two weeks. During this time, she exhausts herself by flying as high and long as possible during the day, releasing powerful pheromones that can travel up to 200 miles. She also reflects the sunlight in urgent but graceful rhythms and color sequences. This light is a mating beacon that no males of the species can resist. When a male prismatic dragon is attracted, he abandons his usual activities (guarding his hoard and defending his territory from enemies) and scans the horizon for the beacon. If the pattern of the lights is clumsy, he may not respond. If more than one responds, they compete with mating lights of their own.</p><br><table><tr class=\"cn\"><th>Age</th><th>Body Lgt.
