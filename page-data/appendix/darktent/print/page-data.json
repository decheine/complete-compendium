While the powers listed above are the most common, some aarakocra have different or additional powers.</p><p class=\"f\">A race of intelligent, birdlike creatures living in the deepest deserts of Athas, the rare Athasian <a href=\"/appendix/aarakocr\">aarakocra</a> spends its time soaring on thermals in search of food.</p><p>The aarakocra is 7 to 8 feet tall with a wingspan of 20 feet or more. Because of its large wingspan, an aarakocra can carry as much as 75% of its own body weight and still fly easily. An aarakocra can fly a short distance carrying a burden equaling 125% of its own body weight. The average body weight of a full grown male is 100 pounds and a female is 85 pounds.</p><p>Each wing has a &ldquo;hand&rdquo; at its midpoint, consisting of three fingers and an opposable thumb. The fourth finger forms the rigid leading edge of the wing. In flight the hands cannot be used, but on the ground the aarakocra can use its hands almost as a human would. The aarakocra's body is protected by a thin bony plate on the chest, much like a solid rib cage. Talons on its legs can be used as claws and can be retracted to reveal a second set of hands, also with three fingers and an opposable thumb. Except for the chest plate, the entire skeleton is hollow and extremely fragile.</p><p>From a distance, the Athasian aarakocra resembles a huge <a href=\"/appendix/bird\">vulture</a>. Its black eyes, set in the front of the head, provide excellent vision over a long range. The plumage is generally black with a white collar for adult males and black or brown with a smaller white collar for females. Adolescents are a mixture of brown and black. The beak is large and covers most of the head. Plumage begins at the crown of the head and is darker near the head, except for the collar. Athasian aarakocra speak their own language and the languages of vultures and other large birds. Some speak the common tongue (5% to 10% chance depending on how deep in the wastelands a tribe lives).</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Combat:</b> Aarakocra can fight in the air or on the ground. They prefer aerial combat since their bones are too fragile to withstand a solid blow from a human-sized opponent. In combat against creatures on the ground, they prefer to fly over their victim and drop weighted nets. Some aarakocra use darts to harass ground-based opponents.</p><p>If their opponents can fly, the aarakocra generally forgo the use of the net, although large groups sometimes use nets on flying creatures. Normally, aarakocra attack flying creatures with long spears, diving from above and allowing the momentum to carry the spear through the target. Such an attack doubles the damage if the aarakocra have been able to dive at least 50 feet. Only the very largest aarakocra can carry more than one of these spears, they can attack with both at once with no penalty, causing double damage on each strike. All diving attacks are made at +4 and should be treated as a charge attack. All other penalties and restrictions of charge attacks apply.</p><p>The effect of the aarakocra's nets depends on if the opponent is flying at the time it becomes entangled. Creatures on the ground that are hit by a net are entangled and unable to participate in any combat until they make a successful Strength check to get free of the net. Flying creatures hit by a net can no longer fly and immediately begin falling. If they cannot escape the net or use some magical means to arrest the fall, normal falling damage applies.</p><p>Unless victims are entangled in nets, aarakocra are cautious in ground combat. If the aarakocra outnumber their opponents they advance in a straight line and thrust with their spears. If outnumbered, or the opponents are particularly tough, the aarakocra withdraw. Victims entangled in nets are killed or incapacitated for use as food or ransom.</p><p>Athasian aarakocra are mindful of their physical limitations as well as their comparatively low psionic abilities. They do not normally initiate psionic combat. At the first sign of psionic powers from any of their victims, however, all aarakocra that have some ability will use whatever attack and defense modes they can in an attempt to destroy the threat. Large groups of is or more aarakocra may initiate psionic combat if their leaders feel they can win quickly and avoid physical combat.</p><p>In desperation, an aarakocra can attempt to bite an opponent in combat. Because of the unwieldiness of its beak, the aarakocra has a THAC0 of 18 if attacking with this appendage. Further, the birdman causes only 1d2 points of damage with the beak.</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Habitat/Society:</b> Athasian aarakocra live in tribes with 6-20 (2d8+4) members, depending on the prestige of the leader. The largest tribe ever recorded had 50 members. The tribal hunting territory depends on the size of the tribe, usually about 500 square miles for a tribe of 10 members. There are no rigid boundaries between tribes and border disputes are not uncommon.</p><p>Alignments of tribe members are similar to the alignment of the leader. A tribe that has a leader who is neutral good may have neutral good, chaotic good, lawful good, and true neutral members. A predominantly evil tribe does not recognize boundaries with other tribes and treats other tribes as inferior beings to be eliminated.</p><p>Athasian aarakocra aren't happy in enclosed spaces, but they they take refuge in a cave or building if necessary.</p><p>Nonevil tribes live in rocky aeries in the highest peaks they can find. Evil tribes are normally nomadic and use an aerie made by another tribe if they need to remain in an area for a long time, even if they have to evict the tribe that made the nest.</p><p>Aarakocra aren't friendly toward intruders in their territory, especially caravans. They try to extract a toll from the caravan for passage through the desert. Good-aligned tribes allow unhindered passage of caravans that pay a tribute. If someone refuses to pay the tribute, the aarakocra try to capture scouts or outriders from the party and hold them until an even larger tribute is paid. The payment may be either livestock or shiny objects. Aarakocra are smart enough not to be taken in by glass baubles instead of gems, although they cannot tell the difference between the more common gems and the rare ones.</p><p>Evil tribes ask for tribute and often attack a caravan whether it pays or not. Aarakocra always demand shiny objects such as stones. These tribes find humans and demihumans to be quite tasty and prefer them to other food.</p><p>Good-aligned tribes of aarakocra sometimes return a lost traveler to the edge of the desert after first removing any valuables the traveler may be carrying. On very rare occasions a tribe might return a lost group of travelers to the more frequently traveled parts of the desert, again after first taking any valuables as payment.</p><p>The oldest male is the leader of the tribal hunting party and has 4+4 Hit Dice. The oldest female is in charge of the tribal aerie and has 3+3 HD. In tribes that have more than 15 members, the next oldest aarakocra serves as shaman and has 3+3 HD; the shaman completes the triumvirate necessary for proper worship and the summoning of elementals. (Interestingly, no magic-using aarakocra has ever been recorded.) Tribes without a shaman cannot summon <a href=\"/appendix/element1\">air elementals</a>, which is an important part of aarakocra culture.</p><p>The shaman is the leader of the daily sun worship. Aarakocra worship the sun because it provides them with the thermals they need to soar in search of food. The shaman also leads the mystic rituals used to summon an air elemental. Summoning an air elemental is usually done only in preparation for the tribe's most sacred ceremony, the hunt. Small tribes must band together for this ceremony to allow the triumvirate to be formed.</p><p>The ceremony to summon an air elemental must be conducted at dawn and requires the oldest male and female to emit a highpitched keening whistle. The shaman conducts an intricate dance around them, simultaneously chanting an ancient summoning mantra.</p><p>The hunt is the final part of the initiation of adolescent aarakocra to adulthood and often takes the tribe far from their normal teritory. The target is always a <a href=\"/appendix/drakalsi\">silt drake</a>. The hunt is the only time the females leave the relative safety of the nest. Even an evil tribe will not interfere with a tribe on a hunt. An air elemental is often summoned to help find the drake, but never takes part in the actual combat. Although the adult members of the tribe take part in the initial phases of the combat, it is the initiates who deliver the final, killing blows to me drake. Scars from the hunt are considered a mark of pride among all aarakocra.</p><p>The females spend about eight months of the year incubating their eggs. Athasian aarakocra mate for life and a pair normally produces as many as 10 offspring. A female lays one egg a year. Constant incubation is not required because of the high daytime temperatures, so the females can maintain the nest and keep the tribe's treasure in order.</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Ecology:</b> Athasian aarakocra are high on the food chain and have no natural enemies other than <a href=\"/appendix/drakatha\">drakes</a>. Unless evil, aarakocra leave their own territory only to hunt the silt drake and return as soon as possible when the hunt is over. (Evil aarakocra attack others, as noted above.) Aarakocra eggs and hatchlings are sought after by wealthy land owners who wish to use the creatures as scouts and sentries. An egg can bring as much as 10 cp in Tyr's marketplace. Tribes that have had eggs or hatchlings stolen have long memories and sometimes take revenge against the thief at a later date. Captive aarakocra join any tribe they come in contact with.</p><p>Athasian aarakocra have a natural life span of 21-30 years.</p>\n","images":["<img src=\"grf/ds.gif\" width=\"150\" height=\"75\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Dark Sun\" title=\"Dark Sun\" align=\"right\">","<img src=\"img/aarakath.gif\" alt=\"Aarakocra (Athas)\" title=\"Aarakocra (Athas)\" border=\"0\" width=\"300\" height=\"360\" style=\"text-align:right;\" align=\"right\">","<img src=\"grf/add2_01.gif\" width=\"200\" height=\"56\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Advanced Dungeons & Dragons 2nd Edition\">"],"setting":"Dark Sun","statblock":{"Aarakocra (Athas)":{"Activity Cycle":"Day","Alignment":"Any","Armor Class":"7","Climate/Terrain":"Deep desert","Damage/Attack":"1d3/1d3 or by weapon","Diet":"Carnivore","Frequency":"Rare","Hit Dice":"2+2","Intelligence":"Average (8-10)","Magic Resistance":"Nil","Morale":"Steady (11)","Movement":"6, Fl 36 (C)","No. Appearing":"1d10","No. of Attacks":"2","Organization":"Tribal","Size":"M (20'+ wingspan)","Special Attacks":"Nil","Special Defenses":"Nil","THAC0":"17","Treasure":"Varies","XP Value":"65"}},"title":"Aarakocra (Athas)"},"sources":["2433"],"statblock_names":[],"title":"Aarakocra (Athas)","prev_key":"zygraat","next_key":"aarakocr","monster_path":"/appendix/aarakath"}}},"pageContext":{"monster_key":"darktent","monster_data":{"TSR":["1060","2158"],"fullBody":"  <table cellspacing=\"0\" cellpadding=\"0\"><tr><th>Climate/Terrain:</th><td>All wetlands</td></tr><tr><th>Frequency:</th><td>Very rare</td></tr><tr><th>Organization:</th><td>Solitary</td></tr><tr><th>Activity Cycle:</th><td>Any</td></tr><tr><th>Diet:</th><td>Carnivore</td></tr><tr><th>Intelligence:</th><td>High (13-14)</td></tr><tr><th>Treasure:</th><td>Nil (B)</td></tr><tr><th>Alignment:</th><td>Chaotic evil</td></tr><tr><th>No. Appearing:</th><td>1</td></tr><tr><th>Armor Class:</th><td>3</td></tr><tr><th>Movement:</th><td>1</td></tr><tr><th>Hit Dice:</th><td>9</td></tr><tr><th>THAC0:</th><td>11</td></tr><tr><th>No. of Attacks:</th><td>5 or 2 per opponent (36 total)</td></tr><tr><th>Damage/Attack:</th><td>1-6 (constrict), 1-2 (slap), or by weapon</td></tr><tr><th>Special Attacks:</th><td><i>Charm</i> spell</td></tr><tr><th>Special Defenses:</th><td><i>Hold</i> and <i>sphere of force</i> spells</td></tr><tr><th>Magic Resistance:</th><td>60%</td></tr><tr><th>Size:</th><td>L to H (7-15'+)</td></tr><tr><th>Morale:</th><td>Elite (13)</td></tr><tr><th>XP Value:</th><td>14,000</td></tr></table><p class=\"f\">A darktentacles is a many-tentacled, solitary amphibious predator. Darktentacles are intelligent and use treasure to lure prey within their reach. They never seem to slumber, nor forget those who escape them.</p><p>A darktentacles has a black, glistening body which it must keep moist or suffer a loss of 1 HD per day. This leathery, amorphous bulk is usually about the size of a cow at adult stage, but the darktentacles can flatten out its mass to cover a much larger area; a darktentacles can usually cover a 10'&times;10' area easily, and many are capable of much larger area coverage.</p><p>Tentacles of up to 20' in length grow all over a darktentacles. A darktentacles may have up to 50 tentacles at one time, but usually only 36 are full-grown. These may slap opponents, grasp and constrict them, or wield weapons.</p><p>Each tentacle is studded with many small, shielded eyes which see as humans do, but also have 140' infravision which operates underwater at a range of 70'. A darktentacles also senses vibrations, &ldquo;smells&rdquo; substances in water, and discerns color and light differences through nodes all over its body.</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Combat:</b> A darktentacles can simultaneously battle as many opponents as it can reach. A maximum of five tentacles can reach a single opponent in a round; only two tentacles can wield weapons against one opponent without hampering or damaging other tentacles.</p><p>Weapons used by a darktentacles do normal damage. A single tentacle may wield a two-handed weapon without initiative or attack penalty. Tentacles can also slap or grip a foe; slapping tentacles cause 1d2 points of damage per attack.</p><p>To grip, a tentacle requires a successful attack roll. It does no damage when striking in this way, but causes the victim to attack at -1 thereafter, as it holds on. In subsequent rounds, a grasping tentacle constricts for 1-6 damage each round.</p><p>Two tentacles grasping a victim cause the victim to attack at -2, suffer a one point armor class penalty, and move at half speed.</p><p>Three tentacles cause the victim's attacks to be at -3, the victim suffers an armor class penalty of -3, and the victim cannot move more than three feet from his or her current position.</p><p>Four tentacles holding a victim can prevent any movement away from the darktentacles, cause the victim to suffer an armor class penalty of -6 and an attack penalty of -4. The amphiboid creature can then attempt its <i>charm</i>-like spell; the effects of this power are identical to a <i>charm monster</i> spell. It raises a tentacle out of the water before the entrapped victim's eyes and <i>charms</i> the creature with its eye-covered tentacle. A <i>charmed</i> creature does all that it can to help the darktentacles, from luring food to it to protecting it from dangerous foes. The darktentacles communicates mentally with its <i>charmed</i> slaves. A save versus spell negates the <i>charm</i> effects. This is the only way the darktentacles can bring creatures under its sway, and it can attempt this only three times per day. The same action also is used when the darktentacles wishes to use its <i>hold monster</i> ability. The process above doesn't change, but the victim must save versus spells at a -3 or be paralyzed for eight rounds. This <i>hold monster</i> ability can be used five times a day; the darktentacles uses it to trap a number of victims, drowning them before they can regain mobility. Five tentacles holding a victim prevent all movement except twisting and writhing, cause attacks to be made at -5, and they lower armor class to ten, regardless of armor or magical defenses.</p><p>Allow a grasped victim a Strength Check to see if an in tended movement or action other than an attack can be carried out against the force of the darktentacles; attacks against the darktentacles are adjusted above. A darktentacles will often lurk in water and try to drown prey in it. A passive character can remain under the water for 1 round per point of Strength before drowning. An active, fighting character can stay under for half that time. In any round in which a character makes no attacks, he or she can try to reach the surface to breathe, unless the darktentacles stops him or her. If held by one or more tentacles, reaching the surface requires two successful Strength Checks - one check to get to the surface, and one check to get nose and mouth free of the water or a tentacle to breathe. If both fail, two Checks are required in the following round-one to stay at the surface against the tug and wrench of the tentacle( s), and the other to get clear access to the air again. Any single attack dealing a tentacle seven or more hit points of damage in a round, or a cumulative damage total of 14 or more points, causes a tentacle to let go of whatever it holds and writhe about harmlessly for the next round before attacking again. Attacks totalling 20 hit points of damage sever a tentacle.</p><p>A darktentacles can use all of its tentacles in a single round without penalty, provided it can reach that many opponents. It can wield all magical weapons and items not restricted to a certain class that do not require speech or delicate manipulations, such as pressing buttons. Darktentacles eat meat, but only that of recently-dead prey that they have drowned or slain. The three beak-like mouths of a darktentacles are not actively used in combat, but a creature suffers 3-12 points of damage if driven into one. There is a 10% chance that a character may accidentally step into one of the darktentacles, mouths, causing the identical damage as above.</p><p>A darktentacles can create a <i>sphere of force</i> once per week. A darktentacles' <i>sphere of force</i> is akin to the fifth level wizard spell <i>wall of force</i>, save that it is always spherical in shape, can be cast at a distance of 90 yards, and will successfully form even if trees, ground, water, and other solid things break its intended boundaries (i.e. it can be cast partly underwater, or through solid ground to trap creatures on the surface and in a tunnel or cavern below). The sphere has whatever radius the darktentacles desires, up to a maximum of 60'. It lasts only as long as the darktentacles concentrates on it. A darktentacles typically uses this to isolate dangerous foes so that it can escape, deal with them later, or trap intended prey in an enclosed area with it, so that they cannot escape!</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Habitat/Society:</b> Originally found in jungle areas, where they are worshipped by primitive creatures of several races, these solitary, roaming carnivores are also infesting swamplands in Calimshan and Cormyr. The Harpers report at least three darktentacles within the Mere of Dead Men and are looking for adventurers to exterminate the monsters before they multiply. Their migration north is inexplicable, but their presence cannot be ignored. They prefer still, relatively warm water to colder and faster depths, but suffer no harm from the latter.</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Ecology:</b> Darktentacles serve as wetland predators, eating the numerous birds and fish common to such areas. They also hunt on shallow marine banks and reefs where fish shoal. They reproduce by budding once every two years. The darktentacles tend to travel constantly for two weeks before budding, moving far away from their lairs and releasing a two hit dice darktentacle in a random wilderness area. During this trek, the darktentacles has a movement rate of 16, using its tentacles as legs to speed its movement away from a rival darktentacles. They will never be found within five miles of one another due to large territorial claims and potential problems with interfering with each other's hunting.</p><p>When slain, darktentacles' flesh, eyes, or ichor are excellent for use as spell ingredients and material components for <i>wall of force</i> spells and similar magic items which use that spell.</p><p>The darktentacles is an incredibly rare monster in the Realms, and many adventurers are thankful of that fact. Only in the records of the Guild of Naturalists is there any mention of the darktentacles; they postulate that the darktentacles is a cross-breed of a <a href=\"/appendix/roper\">roper</a> and a <a href=\"/appendix/lurker\">trapper</a>. The report suggests a much weaker strain of the darktentacles than that catalogued above.</p><p>Sages currently theorize that the darktentacles are now at a heightened level of power as a result of the Time of Troubles. Whether this monster will remain at its current level of power is dependent on its breeding true and maintaining its magical benefits. Since the Time of the Avatars, the Harpers report a larger number of darktentacles sightings in the North; one specimen, found in a magic-dead zone, is reputedly close to the recorded version published by the Guild of Naturalists.</p>\n","images":["<img src=\"grf/fr.gif\" width=\"150\" height=\"75\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Forgotten Realms\" title=\"Forgotten Realms\" align=\"right\">","<img src=\"img/darktent.gif\" alt=\"Darktentacles\" title=\"Darktentacles\" border=\"0\" width=\"300\" height=\"360\" style=\"text-align:right;\" align=\"right\">","<img src=\"grf/add2_01.gif\" width=\"200\" height=\"56\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Advanced Dungeons & Dragons 2nd Edition\">"],"setting":"Forgotten Realms","statblock":{"Darktentacles":{"Activity Cycle":"Any","Alignment":"Chaotic evil","Armor Class":"3","Climate/Terrain":"All wetlands","Damage/Attack":"1-6 (constrict), 1-2 (slap), or by weapon","Diet":"Carnivore","Frequency":"Very rare","Hit Dice":"9","Intelligence":"High (13-14)","Magic Resistance":"60%","Morale":"Elite (13)","Movement":"1","No. Appearing":"1","No. of Attacks":"5 or 2 per opponent (36 total)","Organization":"Solitary","Size":"L to H (7-15'+)","Special Attacks":"<i>Charm</i> spell","Special Defenses":"<i>Hold</i> and <i>sphere of force</i> spells","THAC0":"11","Treasure":"Nil (B)","XP Value":"14,000"}},"title":"Darktentacles"},"sources":["1060","2158"],"statblock_names":[],"title":"Darktentacles","prev_key":"darkstal","next_key":"darkweav","monster_path":"/appendix/darktent"}},"staticQueryHashes":[],"slicesMap":{}}
