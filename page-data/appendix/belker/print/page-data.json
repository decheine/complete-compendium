While the powers listed above are the most common, some aarakocra have different or additional powers.</p><p class=\"f\">A race of intelligent, birdlike creatures living in the deepest deserts of Athas, the rare Athasian <a href=\"/appendix/aarakocr\">aarakocra</a> spends its time soaring on thermals in search of food.</p><p>The aarakocra is 7 to 8 feet tall with a wingspan of 20 feet or more. Because of its large wingspan, an aarakocra can carry as much as 75% of its own body weight and still fly easily. An aarakocra can fly a short distance carrying a burden equaling 125% of its own body weight. The average body weight of a full grown male is 100 pounds and a female is 85 pounds.</p><p>Each wing has a &ldquo;hand&rdquo; at its midpoint, consisting of three fingers and an opposable thumb. The fourth finger forms the rigid leading edge of the wing. In flight the hands cannot be used, but on the ground the aarakocra can use its hands almost as a human would. The aarakocra's body is protected by a thin bony plate on the chest, much like a solid rib cage. Talons on its legs can be used as claws and can be retracted to reveal a second set of hands, also with three fingers and an opposable thumb. Except for the chest plate, the entire skeleton is hollow and extremely fragile.</p><p>From a distance, the Athasian aarakocra resembles a huge <a href=\"/appendix/bird\">vulture</a>. Its black eyes, set in the front of the head, provide excellent vision over a long range. The plumage is generally black with a white collar for adult males and black or brown with a smaller white collar for females. Adolescents are a mixture of brown and black. The beak is large and covers most of the head. Plumage begins at the crown of the head and is darker near the head, except for the collar. Athasian aarakocra speak their own language and the languages of vultures and other large birds. Some speak the common tongue (5% to 10% chance depending on how deep in the wastelands a tribe lives).</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Combat:</b> Aarakocra can fight in the air or on the ground. They prefer aerial combat since their bones are too fragile to withstand a solid blow from a human-sized opponent. In combat against creatures on the ground, they prefer to fly over their victim and drop weighted nets. Some aarakocra use darts to harass ground-based opponents.</p><p>If their opponents can fly, the aarakocra generally forgo the use of the net, although large groups sometimes use nets on flying creatures. Normally, aarakocra attack flying creatures with long spears, diving from above and allowing the momentum to carry the spear through the target. Such an attack doubles the damage if the aarakocra have been able to dive at least 50 feet. Only the very largest aarakocra can carry more than one of these spears, they can attack with both at once with no penalty, causing double damage on each strike. All diving attacks are made at +4 and should be treated as a charge attack. All other penalties and restrictions of charge attacks apply.</p><p>The effect of the aarakocra's nets depends on if the opponent is flying at the time it becomes entangled. Creatures on the ground that are hit by a net are entangled and unable to participate in any combat until they make a successful Strength check to get free of the net. Flying creatures hit by a net can no longer fly and immediately begin falling. If they cannot escape the net or use some magical means to arrest the fall, normal falling damage applies.</p><p>Unless victims are entangled in nets, aarakocra are cautious in ground combat. If the aarakocra outnumber their opponents they advance in a straight line and thrust with their spears. If outnumbered, or the opponents are particularly tough, the aarakocra withdraw. Victims entangled in nets are killed or incapacitated for use as food or ransom.</p><p>Athasian aarakocra are mindful of their physical limitations as well as their comparatively low psionic abilities. They do not normally initiate psionic combat. At the first sign of psionic powers from any of their victims, however, all aarakocra that have some ability will use whatever attack and defense modes they can in an attempt to destroy the threat. Large groups of is or more aarakocra may initiate psionic combat if their leaders feel they can win quickly and avoid physical combat.</p><p>In desperation, an aarakocra can attempt to bite an opponent in combat. Because of the unwieldiness of its beak, the aarakocra has a THAC0 of 18 if attacking with this appendage. Further, the birdman causes only 1d2 points of damage with the beak.</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Habitat/Society:</b> Athasian aarakocra live in tribes with 6-20 (2d8+4) members, depending on the prestige of the leader. The largest tribe ever recorded had 50 members. The tribal hunting territory depends on the size of the tribe, usually about 500 square miles for a tribe of 10 members. There are no rigid boundaries between tribes and border disputes are not uncommon.</p><p>Alignments of tribe members are similar to the alignment of the leader. A tribe that has a leader who is neutral good may have neutral good, chaotic good, lawful good, and true neutral members. A predominantly evil tribe does not recognize boundaries with other tribes and treats other tribes as inferior beings to be eliminated.</p><p>Athasian aarakocra aren't happy in enclosed spaces, but they they take refuge in a cave or building if necessary.</p><p>Nonevil tribes live in rocky aeries in the highest peaks they can find. Evil tribes are normally nomadic and use an aerie made by another tribe if they need to remain in an area for a long time, even if they have to evict the tribe that made the nest.</p><p>Aarakocra aren't friendly toward intruders in their territory, especially caravans. They try to extract a toll from the caravan for passage through the desert. Good-aligned tribes allow unhindered passage of caravans that pay a tribute. If someone refuses to pay the tribute, the aarakocra try to capture scouts or outriders from the party and hold them until an even larger tribute is paid. The payment may be either livestock or shiny objects. Aarakocra are smart enough not to be taken in by glass baubles instead of gems, although they cannot tell the difference between the more common gems and the rare ones.</p><p>Evil tribes ask for tribute and often attack a caravan whether it pays or not. Aarakocra always demand shiny objects such as stones. These tribes find humans and demihumans to be quite tasty and prefer them to other food.</p><p>Good-aligned tribes of aarakocra sometimes return a lost traveler to the edge of the desert after first removing any valuables the traveler may be carrying. On very rare occasions a tribe might return a lost group of travelers to the more frequently traveled parts of the desert, again after first taking any valuables as payment.</p><p>The oldest male is the leader of the tribal hunting party and has 4+4 Hit Dice. The oldest female is in charge of the tribal aerie and has 3+3 HD. In tribes that have more than 15 members, the next oldest aarakocra serves as shaman and has 3+3 HD; the shaman completes the triumvirate necessary for proper worship and the summoning of elementals. (Interestingly, no magic-using aarakocra has ever been recorded.) Tribes without a shaman cannot summon <a href=\"/appendix/element1\">air elementals</a>, which is an important part of aarakocra culture.</p><p>The shaman is the leader of the daily sun worship. Aarakocra worship the sun because it provides them with the thermals they need to soar in search of food. The shaman also leads the mystic rituals used to summon an air elemental. Summoning an air elemental is usually done only in preparation for the tribe's most sacred ceremony, the hunt. Small tribes must band together for this ceremony to allow the triumvirate to be formed.</p><p>The ceremony to summon an air elemental must be conducted at dawn and requires the oldest male and female to emit a highpitched keening whistle. The shaman conducts an intricate dance around them, simultaneously chanting an ancient summoning mantra.</p><p>The hunt is the final part of the initiation of adolescent aarakocra to adulthood and often takes the tribe far from their normal teritory. The target is always a <a href=\"/appendix/drakalsi\">silt drake</a>. The hunt is the only time the females leave the relative safety of the nest. Even an evil tribe will not interfere with a tribe on a hunt. An air elemental is often summoned to help find the drake, but never takes part in the actual combat. Although the adult members of the tribe take part in the initial phases of the combat, it is the initiates who deliver the final, killing blows to me drake. Scars from the hunt are considered a mark of pride among all aarakocra.</p><p>The females spend about eight months of the year incubating their eggs. Athasian aarakocra mate for life and a pair normally produces as many as 10 offspring. A female lays one egg a year. Constant incubation is not required because of the high daytime temperatures, so the females can maintain the nest and keep the tribe's treasure in order.</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Ecology:</b> Athasian aarakocra are high on the food chain and have no natural enemies other than <a href=\"/appendix/drakatha\">drakes</a>. Unless evil, aarakocra leave their own territory only to hunt the silt drake and return as soon as possible when the hunt is over. (Evil aarakocra attack others, as noted above.) Aarakocra eggs and hatchlings are sought after by wealthy land owners who wish to use the creatures as scouts and sentries. An egg can bring as much as 10 cp in Tyr's marketplace. Tribes that have had eggs or hatchlings stolen have long memories and sometimes take revenge against the thief at a later date. Captive aarakocra join any tribe they come in contact with.</p><p>Athasian aarakocra have a natural life span of 21-30 years.</p><br clear=\"all\" style=\"clear:both; height:0;\">\r\n","images":["<img src=\"grf/ds.gif\" width=\"150\" height=\"75\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Dark Sun\" title=\"Dark Sun\" align=\"right\">","<img src=\"img/aarakath.gif\" alt=\"Aarakocra (Athas)\" title=\"Aarakocra (Athas)\" border=\"0\" width=\"300\" height=\"360\" style=\"text-align:right;\" align=\"right\">","<img src=\"grf/add2_01.gif\" width=\"200\" height=\"56\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Advanced Dungeons & Dragons 2nd Edition\">"],"setting":"Dark Sun","statblock":{"Aarakocra (Athas)":{"Activity Cycle":"Day","Alignment":"Any","Armor Class":"7","Climate/Terrain":"Deep desert","Damage/Attack":"1d3/1d3 or by weapon","Diet":"Carnivore","Frequency":"Rare","Hit Dice":"2+2","Intelligence":"Average (8-10)","Magic Resistance":"Nil","Morale":"Steady (11)","Movement":"6, Fl 36 (C)","No. Appearing":"1d10","No. of Attacks":"2","Organization":"Tribal","Size":"M (20'+ wingspan)","Special Attacks":"Nil","Special Defenses":"Nil","THAC0":"17","Treasure":"Varies","XP Value":"65"}},"title":"Aarakocra (Athas)"},"sources":["2433"],"statblock_names":[],"title":"Aarakocra (Athas)","prev_key":"zygraat","next_key":"aarakocr","monster_path":"/appendix/aarakath"}}},"pageContext":{"monster_key":"belker","monster_data":{"TSR":["2635"],"fullBody":"  <table cellspacing=\"0\" cellpadding=\"0\"><tr><th>Climate/Terrain:</th><td>Paraplane of Smoke</td></tr><tr><th>Frequency:</th><td>Rare</td></tr><tr><th>Organization:</th><td>Solitary</td></tr><tr><th>Activity Cycle:</th><td>Any</td></tr><tr><th>Diet:</th><td>Carnivore</td></tr><tr><th>Intelligence:</th><td>Very (11-12)</td></tr><tr><th>Treasure:</th><td>Nil</td></tr><tr><th>Alignment:</th><td>Neutral evil</td></tr><tr><th>No. Appearing:</th><td>1 or 1d3</td></tr><tr><th>Armor Class:</th><td>-2</td></tr><tr><th>Movement:</th><td>12, Fl 18 (B)</td></tr><tr><th>Hit Dice:</th><td>7+3</td></tr><tr><th>THAC0:</th><td>13</td></tr><tr><th>No. of Attacks:</th><td>3 or 2</td></tr><tr><th>Damage/Attack:</th><td>1d3/1d3/1d4 or 1d6/1d6</td></tr><tr><th>Special Attacks:</th><td>Noxious fumes</td></tr><tr><th>Special Defenses:</th><td>Smoke form, immunities</td></tr><tr><th>Magic Resistance:</th><td>20% (40% in smoke form)</td></tr><tr><th>Size:</th><td>L (7-9' tall)</td></tr><tr><th>Morale:</th><td>Champion (15-16)</td></tr><tr><th>XP Value:</th><td>5,000</td></tr></table><p class=\"f\">I am not what you might think. Do you see me as a creature of evil nature or intent? I enjoy peace and solitude, not violence or pain. Yet still I'm regarded as though I were a monster - a fiend from the Abyss. Oh, yes, I know of the Abyss. I'm aware of the Outer Planes that stretch beyond our Inner Planes. I've never been there, but I have heard tales. And because my form looks a bit fiendish and I have large black wings - well, I know what you think when you see me. But I'm no devilish tormentor from the Lower Planes.</p><p>Someone such as you might consider me an elemental creature. I suppose that I am - your kind refers to my home as the Paraelemental Plane of Smoke. Creatures that I call the N'raaigib, you call <a href=\"/appendix/paraelem\">smoke paraelementals</a> (that, in itself, says much of our difference, does it not?) Smoke is an integral part of my essence, and thus you would name me an <a href=\"/appendix/elemsmok\">elemental</a> as well. That's fine. I'm not bothered by it - quite flattered, really. Smoke is one of the fundamental components of existence, and I'm glad that you're aware of that.</p><p>I can even alter the composition of my body to become as the smoke of my home. This ability provides me with many advantages, and makes me a great deal different from you. But different is not always evil.</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Combat:</b> When I must fight, I do so with claws and fangs <i>[1d3/1d3/1d4]</i> or with powerful blows from my large wings <i>[1d6/1d6]</i> - particularly if I am in my smoke form. Did I mention that I can transform my body into a smoky cloud? When I do, however, my wings remain completely solid.</p><p>Turning to smoke is a useful defensive measure, certainly, but it also complements my natural weaponry. It allows me to weaken a foe in the manner I really prefer - from the inside. You see, if a creature such as yourself - and by that I mean someone who breathes air (not that I would ever think of harming you) - engages in combat with me, my favorite tactic is to transform my body into smoke and let my foe simply inhale me.</p><p>Ah, what a wondrous feeling that is! Then, while the air-breather coughs and chokes on the vapors of which I'm composed <i>[saving throw versus poison to avoid]</i>, I make a portion or myself solid - a claw, perhaps - directly inside his body. This causes him great distress. <i>[If the victim failed his saving throw, the attack automatically succeeds, inflicting 3d4 points of damage per round. Each round, the victim can attempt another saving throw versus poison to expel the smoky creature from his body.]</i></p><p>Best of all, while in my smoke form, I can be harmed only by enchanted weapons <i>[+1 or better]</i>, and my resistance to magic doubles. I can transform into smoke at will, and I can even turn only part of my body to smoke and leave the rest solid, if I wish. However, as I think I mentioned before, I can never turn fully to smoke - my wings remain solid in any situation. <i>[If any portion of the balker is smoke, its special defenses are in effect - that is, it's hit only by +1 or better weapons and its magic resistance doubles.]</i> Sadly, I can sustain my smoky form for only a short while each day <i>[20 rounds per day, which need not be consecutive]</i>.</p><p>Still find me fiendish or frightening? I'll tell you what - as a show of good faith, I'll even reveal to you a few of my weaknesses. Perhaps that will set your mind at ease. You see, while my smoke form helps to protect me from attacks with weapons, it makes me especially vulnerable to certain kinds of magic. Cold-based attacks inflict twice their usual damage, a <i>gust of wind</i> spell sends me up to a mile away, and a <i>wind wall</i> entraps me as if it were a <i>hold</i> spell.</p><p>No matter what form I'm in, though. I'm always immune to heat, fire, poison, paralyzation, and petrification. And, as a last note, I apparently have the unique ability to damage other creatures that can also transform into smoke or mist - even when they're normally considered untouchable. It must be a product of the environment in which I flourish. I've never thought much about it, but I've heard that I could attack and destroy even a vampire (whatever that is) in its mist form.</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Habitat/Society:</b> Most of the time, I keep to myself. Only when one of the baser needs comes upon me do I seek out the company of others - and even then, it's only for a short time. Sometimes, though, it is enjoyable to hunt with my fellows. We work well together, bringing down our prey quickly and efficiently. If our hunger is great, we finish the meal off quickly. Other times&hellip; not so quickly. You'd be surprised how loud some creatures can squeal when they're in pain. When I catch something particularly soft-fleshed, I like to - well, I suppose you'd call that evil. You're quick to judge, aren't you?</p><p>Occasionally, when things grow particularly boring, some of us find the time to procreate. Once born, however, my kind learns to survive on its own. We're not coddled like mewling infants, and that's part of what makes us strong. We thrive and nourish here in our own realm. thank you, with little interference from outsiders like yourself.</p><p>Look around you, at this large cinder in which I've made my lair - impressive, yes? For the most part, cinders like these are the only solid surfaces on the entire plane, and they're quite rare. I'll slay any fool that - I mean, rather, that intruders are not welcome, even others of my kind.</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Ecology:</b> I eat whatever I please. Nothing can escape me when I'm on the hunt. Most of the time, I feed on tiny creatures that I believe you call vapor rats and smoke mephits. (Strangely enough, some of your <q>scholars</q> believe me related to the mephits - the fools.) But whenever something new crosses my path, I just can't resist - that is, I try to&hellip; ah&hellip; (smack) you, erm&hellip; Pardon me. It's just that (smack smack)&hellip; it's just that you look so - well, <i>tasty</i>&hellip;</p><br clear=\"all\" style=\"clear:both; height:0;\">\r\n","images":["<img src=\"grf/ps.gif\" width=\"150\" height=\"75\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Planescape\" title=\"Planescape\" align=\"right\">","<img src=\"img/belker.gif\" alt=\"Belker\" title=\"Belker\" border=\"0\" width=\"300\" height=\"360\" style=\"text-align:right;\" align=\"right\">","<img src=\"grf/add2_01.gif\" width=\"200\" height=\"56\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Advanced Dungeons & Dragons 2nd Edition\">"],"setting":"Planescape","statblock":{"Belker":{"Activity Cycle":"Any","Alignment":"Neutral evil","Armor Class":"-2","Climate/Terrain":"Paraplane of Smoke","Damage/Attack":"1d3/1d3/1d4 or 1d6/1d6","Diet":"Carnivore","Frequency":"Rare","Hit Dice":"7+3","Intelligence":"Very (11-12)","Magic Resistance":"20% (40% in smoke form)","Morale":"Champion (15-16)","Movement":"12, Fl 18 (B)","No. Appearing":"1 or 1d3","No. of Attacks":"3 or 2","Organization":"Solitary","Size":"L (7-9' tall)","Special Attacks":"Noxious fumes","Special Defenses":"Smoke form, immunities","THAC0":"13","Treasure":"Nil","XP Value":"5,000"}},"title":"Belker"},"sources":["2635"],"statblock_names":[],"title":"Belker","prev_key":"belgoi","next_key":"berbalan","monster_path":"/appendix/belker"}},"staticQueryHashes":[],"slicesMap":{}}
