Many hapless adventurers have been fatally fooled by the dragon's dopey appearance and delicate pink coloration. Pink dragons love to talk, but they are prone to eat those who do not laugh at their jokes.</p><p>The breath weapon of the pink dragon is highly unusual. A special stomach serves to mix fatty secretions with a fluid closely resembling lye. The resulting goop produces the breath weapon, a bubble cloud similar to that produced by a <i>horn of bubbles</i>. This cloud is 60' long, 50' wide, and 20' high, and it lasts 2-12 rounds. Anyone trapped in this cloud is painfully blinded for 4-16 rounds due to soap in his eyes, making magic virtually impossible to cast; this places a -6 penalty on all attack rolls, saving throws, and damage (1 hp damage minimum), and negates dexterity bonuses to armor class. Movement is random as the affected person stumbles around. A successful save vs. breath weapon indicates that the character closed his eyes before the soap affected them, in which case only the normal penalties for fighting blind apply, without the distraction caused by the pain of the soap in the eyes. If the victim?s eyes are protected, as by goggles, the obscuring effects alone are operative, giving only a -2 modifier to hit for as long as the bubbles last. There is no saving throw against the obscurement effect, as the cloud also affects infravision and ultravision. When the bubble cloud is in place, the dragon merely closes his transparent protective third eyelids and, using a batlike sonar, attacks with his highly accurate claw/claw/bite routine.</p><p>Those few pink dragons able to use magic (20%) gain one first-level mage spell (as per illusionists), determined randomly, for each stage of growth. If a spell is rolled twice, the dragon is able to use that spell twice per day. Due to the somewhat silly appearance of the pink dragon, it completely lacks any sort of fear aura.</p><p><br></p><p class=\"ni\"><i>Created by: Jeanne McGuire</i></p><br clear=\"all\" style=\"clear:both; height:0;\">\r\n","images":["<img src=\"grf/dr.gif\" width=\"150\" height=\"75\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Dragon Magazine\" title=\"Dragon Magazine\" align=\"right\">","<img src=\"grf/add2_01.gif\" width=\"200\" height=\"56\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Advanced Dungeons & Dragons 2nd Edition\">"],"setting":"Dragon Magazine","statblock":{"Dragon, Pink":{"Activity Cycle":"Any","Alignment":"Chaotic neutral","Armor Class":"2","Climate/Terrain":"Any","Damage/Attack":"1-6/1-6/3-18","Diet":"Carnivore","Frequency":"Very rare","Hit Dice":"6-8","Intelligence":"High (13-14)","Magic Resistance":"Nil","Morale":"Average (10)","Movement":"9, Fly 18 (B)","No. Appearing":"1-4","No. of Attacks":"3 (claw/claw/bite)","Organization":"Family group","Size":"L (up to 36' long)","Special Attacks":"Breath weapon, possible spell use","Special Defenses":"Possible spell use","THAC0":"15 (6 HD) or 13 (7-8 HD)","Treasure":"E","XP Value":"650 to 2,000"}},"title":"Dragon, Pink"},"sources":["Dragon#156"],"statblock_names":[],"title":"Dragon, Pink","prev_key":"dragotyr","next_key":"dragpris","monster_path":"/appendix/dragpink"}},"staticQueryHashes":[],"slicesMap":{}}
