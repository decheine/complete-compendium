While the powers listed above are the most common, some aarakocra have different or additional powers.</p><p class=\"f\">A race of intelligent, birdlike creatures living in the deepest deserts of Athas, the rare Athasian <a href=\"/appendix/aarakocr\">aarakocra</a> spends its time soaring on thermals in search of food.</p><p>The aarakocra is 7 to 8 feet tall with a wingspan of 20 feet or more. Because of its large wingspan, an aarakocra can carry as much as 75% of its own body weight and still fly easily. An aarakocra can fly a short distance carrying a burden equaling 125% of its own body weight. The average body weight of a full grown male is 100 pounds and a female is 85 pounds.</p><p>Each wing has a &ldquo;hand&rdquo; at its midpoint, consisting of three fingers and an opposable thumb. The fourth finger forms the rigid leading edge of the wing. In flight the hands cannot be used, but on the ground the aarakocra can use its hands almost as a human would. The aarakocra's body is protected by a thin bony plate on the chest, much like a solid rib cage. Talons on its legs can be used as claws and can be retracted to reveal a second set of hands, also with three fingers and an opposable thumb. Except for the chest plate, the entire skeleton is hollow and extremely fragile.</p><p>From a distance, the Athasian aarakocra resembles a huge <a href=\"/appendix/bird\">vulture</a>. Its black eyes, set in the front of the head, provide excellent vision over a long range. The plumage is generally black with a white collar for adult males and black or brown with a smaller white collar for females. Adolescents are a mixture of brown and black. The beak is large and covers most of the head. Plumage begins at the crown of the head and is darker near the head, except for the collar. Athasian aarakocra speak their own language and the languages of vultures and other large birds. Some speak the common tongue (5% to 10% chance depending on how deep in the wastelands a tribe lives).</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Combat:</b> Aarakocra can fight in the air or on the ground. They prefer aerial combat since their bones are too fragile to withstand a solid blow from a human-sized opponent. In combat against creatures on the ground, they prefer to fly over their victim and drop weighted nets. Some aarakocra use darts to harass ground-based opponents.</p><p>If their opponents can fly, the aarakocra generally forgo the use of the net, although large groups sometimes use nets on flying creatures. Normally, aarakocra attack flying creatures with long spears, diving from above and allowing the momentum to carry the spear through the target. Such an attack doubles the damage if the aarakocra have been able to dive at least 50 feet. Only the very largest aarakocra can carry more than one of these spears, they can attack with both at once with no penalty, causing double damage on each strike. All diving attacks are made at +4 and should be treated as a charge attack. All other penalties and restrictions of charge attacks apply.</p><p>The effect of the aarakocra's nets depends on if the opponent is flying at the time it becomes entangled. Creatures on the ground that are hit by a net are entangled and unable to participate in any combat until they make a successful Strength check to get free of the net. Flying creatures hit by a net can no longer fly and immediately begin falling. If they cannot escape the net or use some magical means to arrest the fall, normal falling damage applies.</p><p>Unless victims are entangled in nets, aarakocra are cautious in ground combat. If the aarakocra outnumber their opponents they advance in a straight line and thrust with their spears. If outnumbered, or the opponents are particularly tough, the aarakocra withdraw. Victims entangled in nets are killed or incapacitated for use as food or ransom.</p><p>Athasian aarakocra are mindful of their physical limitations as well as their comparatively low psionic abilities. They do not normally initiate psionic combat. At the first sign of psionic powers from any of their victims, however, all aarakocra that have some ability will use whatever attack and defense modes they can in an attempt to destroy the threat. Large groups of is or more aarakocra may initiate psionic combat if their leaders feel they can win quickly and avoid physical combat.</p><p>In desperation, an aarakocra can attempt to bite an opponent in combat. Because of the unwieldiness of its beak, the aarakocra has a THAC0 of 18 if attacking with this appendage. Further, the birdman causes only 1d2 points of damage with the beak.</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Habitat/Society:</b> Athasian aarakocra live in tribes with 6-20 (2d8+4) members, depending on the prestige of the leader. The largest tribe ever recorded had 50 members. The tribal hunting territory depends on the size of the tribe, usually about 500 square miles for a tribe of 10 members. There are no rigid boundaries between tribes and border disputes are not uncommon.</p><p>Alignments of tribe members are similar to the alignment of the leader. A tribe that has a leader who is neutral good may have neutral good, chaotic good, lawful good, and true neutral members. A predominantly evil tribe does not recognize boundaries with other tribes and treats other tribes as inferior beings to be eliminated.</p><p>Athasian aarakocra aren't happy in enclosed spaces, but they they take refuge in a cave or building if necessary.</p><p>Nonevil tribes live in rocky aeries in the highest peaks they can find. Evil tribes are normally nomadic and use an aerie made by another tribe if they need to remain in an area for a long time, even if they have to evict the tribe that made the nest.</p><p>Aarakocra aren't friendly toward intruders in their territory, especially caravans. They try to extract a toll from the caravan for passage through the desert. Good-aligned tribes allow unhindered passage of caravans that pay a tribute. If someone refuses to pay the tribute, the aarakocra try to capture scouts or outriders from the party and hold them until an even larger tribute is paid. The payment may be either livestock or shiny objects. Aarakocra are smart enough not to be taken in by glass baubles instead of gems, although they cannot tell the difference between the more common gems and the rare ones.</p><p>Evil tribes ask for tribute and often attack a caravan whether it pays or not. Aarakocra always demand shiny objects such as stones. These tribes find humans and demihumans to be quite tasty and prefer them to other food.</p><p>Good-aligned tribes of aarakocra sometimes return a lost traveler to the edge of the desert after first removing any valuables the traveler may be carrying. On very rare occasions a tribe might return a lost group of travelers to the more frequently traveled parts of the desert, again after first taking any valuables as payment.</p><p>The oldest male is the leader of the tribal hunting party and has 4+4 Hit Dice. The oldest female is in charge of the tribal aerie and has 3+3 HD. In tribes that have more than 15 members, the next oldest aarakocra serves as shaman and has 3+3 HD; the shaman completes the triumvirate necessary for proper worship and the summoning of elementals. (Interestingly, no magic-using aarakocra has ever been recorded.) Tribes without a shaman cannot summon <a href=\"/appendix/element1\">air elementals</a>, which is an important part of aarakocra culture.</p><p>The shaman is the leader of the daily sun worship. Aarakocra worship the sun because it provides them with the thermals they need to soar in search of food. The shaman also leads the mystic rituals used to summon an air elemental. Summoning an air elemental is usually done only in preparation for the tribe's most sacred ceremony, the hunt. Small tribes must band together for this ceremony to allow the triumvirate to be formed.</p><p>The ceremony to summon an air elemental must be conducted at dawn and requires the oldest male and female to emit a highpitched keening whistle. The shaman conducts an intricate dance around them, simultaneously chanting an ancient summoning mantra.</p><p>The hunt is the final part of the initiation of adolescent aarakocra to adulthood and often takes the tribe far from their normal teritory. The target is always a <a href=\"/appendix/drakalsi\">silt drake</a>. The hunt is the only time the females leave the relative safety of the nest. Even an evil tribe will not interfere with a tribe on a hunt. An air elemental is often summoned to help find the drake, but never takes part in the actual combat. Although the adult members of the tribe take part in the initial phases of the combat, it is the initiates who deliver the final, killing blows to me drake. Scars from the hunt are considered a mark of pride among all aarakocra.</p><p>The females spend about eight months of the year incubating their eggs. Athasian aarakocra mate for life and a pair normally produces as many as 10 offspring. A female lays one egg a year. Constant incubation is not required because of the high daytime temperatures, so the females can maintain the nest and keep the tribe's treasure in order.</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Ecology:</b> Athasian aarakocra are high on the food chain and have no natural enemies other than <a href=\"/appendix/drakatha\">drakes</a>. Unless evil, aarakocra leave their own territory only to hunt the silt drake and return as soon as possible when the hunt is over. (Evil aarakocra attack others, as noted above.) Aarakocra eggs and hatchlings are sought after by wealthy land owners who wish to use the creatures as scouts and sentries. An egg can bring as much as 10 cp in Tyr's marketplace. Tribes that have had eggs or hatchlings stolen have long memories and sometimes take revenge against the thief at a later date. Captive aarakocra join any tribe they come in contact with.</p><p>Athasian aarakocra have a natural life span of 21-30 years.</p>\n","images":["<img src=\"grf/ds.gif\" width=\"150\" height=\"75\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Dark Sun\" title=\"Dark Sun\" align=\"right\">","<img src=\"img/aarakath.gif\" alt=\"Aarakocra (Athas)\" title=\"Aarakocra (Athas)\" border=\"0\" width=\"300\" height=\"360\" style=\"text-align:right;\" align=\"right\">","<img src=\"grf/add2_01.gif\" width=\"200\" height=\"56\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Advanced Dungeons & Dragons 2nd Edition\">"],"setting":"Dark Sun","statblock":{"Aarakocra (Athas)":{"Activity Cycle":"Day","Alignment":"Any","Armor Class":"7","Climate/Terrain":"Deep desert","Damage/Attack":"1d3/1d3 or by weapon","Diet":"Carnivore","Frequency":"Rare","Hit Dice":"2+2","Intelligence":"Average (8-10)","Magic Resistance":"Nil","Morale":"Steady (11)","Movement":"6, Fl 36 (C)","No. Appearing":"1d10","No. of Attacks":"2","Organization":"Tribal","Size":"M (20'+ wingspan)","Special Attacks":"Nil","Special Defenses":"Nil","THAC0":"17","Treasure":"Varies","XP Value":"65"}},"title":"Aarakocra (Athas)"},"sources":["2433"],"statblock_names":[],"title":"Aarakocra (Athas)","prev_key":"zygraat","next_key":"aarakocr","monster_path":"/appendix/aarakath"}}},"pageContext":{"monster_key":"spirfolk","monster_data":{"TSR":["2116"],"fullBody":"  <table cellspacing=\"0\" cellpadding=\"0\"><tr class=\"bk\"><th> </th><th class=\"cn\">Bamboo Spirit Folk</th><th class=\"cn\">River Spirit Folk</th><th class=\"cn\">Sea Spirit Folk</th></tr><tr><th>Climate/Terrain:</th><td>Tropical, subtropical, and temperate forests and jungles</td><td>Tropical, subtropical, and temperate rivers</td><td>Tropical, subtropical, and temperate ocean</td></tr><tr><th>Frequency:</th><td>Uncommon</td><td>Uncommon</td><td>Uncommon</td></tr><tr><th>Organization:</th><td>Clans</td><td>Clans</td><td>Clans</td></tr><tr><th>Activity Cycle:</th><td>Any</td><td>Any</td><td>Any</td></tr><tr><th>Diet:</th><td>Omnivore</td><td>Omnivore</td><td>Omnivore</td></tr><tr><th>Intelligence:</th><td>Very to genius (12-18)</td><td>Very to genius (12-18)</td><td>Very to genius (12-18)</td></tr><tr><th>Treasure:</th><td>Individual: L,N; Clan: I</td><td>Individual: N,Q; Clan: C</td><td>Individual: M,N,Q; Clan: A</td></tr><tr><th>Alignment:</th><td>Lawful good or neutral</td><td>Neutral good</td><td>Chaotic good</td></tr><tr><th>No. Appearing:</th><td>1-10</td><td>1-10</td><td>2-20</td></tr><tr><th>Armor Class:</th><td>10</td><td>10</td><td>10</td></tr><tr><th>Movement:</th><td>12</td><td>12, Sw 12</td><td>12, Sw 12</td></tr><tr><th>Hit Dice:</th><td>1</td><td>1</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><th>THAC0:</th><td>20</td><td>20</td><td>20</td></tr><tr><th>No. of Attacks:</th><td>1</td><td>1</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><th>Damage/Attack:</th><td>By weapon</td><td>By weapon</td><td>By weapon</td></tr><tr><th>Special Attacks:</th><td>See below</td><td>See below</td><td>See below</td></tr><tr><th>Special Defenses:</th><td>See below</td><td>See below</td><td>See below</td></tr><tr><th>Magic Resistance:</th><td>See below</td><td>See below</td><td>See below</td></tr><tr><th>Size:</th><td>M (5' tall)</td><td>M (5' tall)</td><td>M (5' tall)</td></tr><tr><th>Morale:</th><td>Elite (13)</td><td>Elite (13)</td><td>Elite (13)</td></tr><tr><th>XP Value:</th><td>175</td><td>175</td><td>175</td></tr></table><p class=\"f\">Spirit folk are the descendants of humans and various <a href=\"/appendix/spirnatu\">spirits of nature</a>. All have strong ties to both the natural world and the society of humans.</p><p>There are three distinct races of spirit folk: bamboo, river, and sea. Of the three, bamboo spirit folk are the type most frequently encountered by humans and other land-dwellers. Like other spirit folk, bamboo spirit folk are nearly indistinguishable from humans. They have thin, supple bodies with golden or pale yellow skin. Their narrow eyes are almond or black with eyebrows so thin that they appear to have been drawn with a pen. Their hair is short, and either blonde, light brown, or grey. The men are always smooth-shaven. Otherwise, bamboo spirit folk appear in all the diversity of humans, radiating a robust love of life and nature. Many approach the ideal of human beauty. They prefer simple dress, usually wearing the clothing of farmers or peasants.</p><p>Because of their strong ties to humans, all spirit folk can be samurai, kensai, or bushi. Their supple bodies give them exceptional Dexterity, and their physical beauty and gentle manner accounts for their high Charisma. Their thin bodies limit their Constitution, however. Spirit folk ability scores are summarized on the table below.</p><p>Bamboo spirit folk speak the languages of all spirit folk, as well as the trade language and the language of the Celestial Court. Each time a bamboo spirit folk gains an experience level, he can learn the language of one forest animal.</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Combat:</b> Spirit folk are highly attuned to nature, and possess special powers when dealing with natural forces and events. These powers are drawn from their spiritual ancestry. Bamboo spirit folk have a 75% chance to recognize and identify normal (nonmagical and unintelligent) plants. They have a 50% chance to identify normal (nonmagical and unintelligent) animals. They can move alone on foot through woodland, forest, or grassland without leaving a trail. When a bamboo spirit folk is traveling with others (including other spirit folk), a modifier of -20% (or -4 if 1d20 is used) is applied to all attempts to follow the group's trail. When in woodlands or forests, the bamboo spirit folk have a 75% chance to hide in shadows. Like all spirit folk, the bamboo spirit folk have infravision with a 120-foot range. In addition, bamboo spirit folk gain a +1 bonus to all saves vs. spells, rods, staves, wands, and miscellaneous magical items that involve the element earth or wood.</p><p>The lifeforce of a bamboo spirit folk is always tied to a bamboo grove deep within a forest. If this grove is damaged, the spirit folk suffers a comparable amount of damage. For example, if half the grove is burned to the ground, the spirit folk loses half of his total hit points. If the grove is destroyed, the spirit folk dies instantly. When a bamboo spirit folk enters his grove, he is instantly cured of all wounds and diseases. This grove can never be moved, nor do shoots sprouted from this grove have any special effect; for instance, if the grove increases in size, the spirit folk does not gain any additional hit points or abilities. A spirit folk is not required to remain within the vicinity of his grove and can travel any distance from his grove without suffering ill effects.</p><p>Though bamboo spirit folk prefer peaceful solutions to violence, they can fight courageously and skillfully when necessary. Bamboo spirit folk employ a variety of weapons. When a force of bamboo spirit folk is encountered, they typically carry short swords (50%), wakizashi (30%), and parang (20%). When anticipating combat, bamboo spirit folk prefer lighter armor, such as leather or padded. A force of ten or more 1st-level bamboo spirit folk bushi is led by either a 2nd- to 5th-level bushi (60% chance), kensai (25%), or samurai (15% ).</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Habitat/Society:</b> Bamboo spirit normally live near forests or jungles. Only occasionally do they establish their own settlements, preferring instead to mingle with human societies where they are not only accepted as equals, but are actively sought as marriage partners because of their beauty and grace.</p><p>Because part of their ancestry is human, all spirit folk must belong to a family or clan. Many are land-holders, and some even assume roles in human governments. However, bamboo spirit folk have a responsibility to the Lord of the Woods that supersedes their responsibilities to human societies. While the spirit folk can never obtain honor from serving their spirit lord, they are required to obey his commands. Failing to do so, or acting in a manner that dishonors the spirit lord, will be punished by natural disasters visited on the spirit folk and his family, including any human relatives. If the interests of the human family and the spirit lord conflict, spirit folk are expected to support their spirit lord first.</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Ecology:</b> Bamboo spirit folk eat the same foods as humans, though they tend to be vegetarians, mainly eating fruits, grains, and vegetables. They have little taste for wine or other strong drink.</p><p class=\"f\"><b>River Spirit Folk</b></p><p class=\"ni\">River spirit folk are associated with one particular river or stream and commonly live somewhere near it. They resemble bamboo spirit folk in appearance and attitude, except that their eyes are blue or green and their hair is usually black. Like bamboo spirit folk, river spirit folk can be samurai, kensai, or bushi.</p><p>River spirit folk can swim in any type of water at their normal movement rate (reduced for encumbrance). When swimming, all items they carry, including unprotected paper or scrolls, remain perfectly dry, even if submerged. River folk can breathe both air and water, though they prefer aquatic environments.</p><p>River spirit folk speak the language of fishes, the language of the Celestial Court, the trade language, and the languages of spirit folk.</p><p>River folk are attuned to water in all its forms, and they gain a +1 bonus to all saving throws vs. spells, rods, staves, wands, and miscellaneous magical items involving the element water. They are especially vulnerable to fire, suffering a -1 penalty on all saving throws vs. fire-based attacks. Once per day, they can <i>lower water</i> in rivers and streams by a depth of 10 feet, allowing others to cross easily; this effect lasts five rounds. Like bamboo spirit folk, river spirit folk have infravision with a 120-foot range.</p><p>The lifeforce of a river spirit folk is tied to a single, specific river as it flows along its natural banks. (Water diverted for irrigation is no longer considered part of the river.) When a river spirit folk bathes in his river, he is instantly cured of all wounds and diseases. Changes in the depth or flow of his river affect him. For instance, if the river is lowered by half during a drought, the spirit folk's hit points and ability scores are also lowered by half. Major flooding makes the spirit folk wild and uncontrollable. Engineering changes (e.g., dams) that permanently alter the river make the spirit folk progressively weaker until he dies.</p><p>A force of river spirit folk typically carries short swords (40%), spears (40%), and daggers (20%). A force of ten or more 1st-level river spirit folk bushi is led by either a 2nd- to 5th-level bushi (60% chance), kensai (25%), or samurai (15%). Forces of more than ten have a proportionate number of leaders (for instance, a force of 30-39 river spirit folk has three leaders).</p><p>River spirit folk are somewhat less integrated into human societies than bamboo spirit folk, though they mingle freely with humans and are also sought by humans as mates. All river spirit folk belong to a family or clan. Their primary responsibility is to the Lord of the Rivers, and they are expected to answer to all of his summons.</p><p>River spirit folk are excellent fishermen, hunters, and guides. They subsist on sea life, enjoying all varieties of fish.</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Sea Spirit Folk</b></p><p class=\"ni\">Sea spirit folk are the most numerous and reclusive of all spirit folk, preferring a nomadic life to association with humans.</p><p>Sea spirit folk share similar characteristics and attitudes with the river spirit folk. They physically resemble river spirit folk, except that their hair is blue or white, and their skin is usually dark green brown, or gray. They can breathe in any salt water or fresh water and can also breathe air. They swim at their normal movement rate (reduced for encumbrance) in any type of water. Items carried when swimming never become wet.</p><p>Sea spirit folk speak the language of fishes and the Celestial Court, the trade language, and the languages of spirit folk.</p><p>A force of sea spirit folk typically carries short swords (30%), tridents (25%), spears (25%), and daggers (20%). A force of ten or more 1st-level sea spirit folk bushi is led by either a 2nd- to 5thlevel bushi (70% chance), kensai (250%), or samurai (5%). Forces of more than ten have a proportionate number of leaders.</p><p>Once per day, sea spirit folk can predict the weather for the next 24 hours with a 75% chance of being correct. They gain a +1 bonus to all saving throws vs. fire-based attacks and have infravision with a 120-foot range.</p><p>Changes in the sea do not affect these spirit folk, nor does the water heal them. Once a year, they can receive one favor from the sea, such as a violent storm, fair sailing winds, rain, or the recovery of a particular item from the ocean floor. Each spirit folk must ask for a specific favor; should two or more sea spirit folk make opposing requests (e.g., if one asks for clear weather and another requests storms), neither request will be granted and their favors for that year are lost.</p><p>Of all the spirit lords, the Sea Lord has the most authority and takes the most interest in the activities of his kin. The Lord of the Sea may bestow gifts upon particularly worthy sea spirit folk, such as those who have completed exceptionally difficult tasks or those who have performed their duties with honor.</p><p> </p><table class=\"ip\"><caption>Spirit Folk Abilities</caption><tr class=\"bk\"><th>Ability</th><th>Min.</th><th>Max.</th></tr><tr><td>Strength</td><td>6</td><td>18</td></tr><tr><td>Intelligence</td><td>12</td><td>18</td></tr><tr><td>Wisdom</td><td>9</td><td>18</td></tr><tr><td>Dexterity</td><td>12</td><td>18</td></tr><tr><td>Constitution</td><td>6</td><td>14</td></tr><tr><td>Charisma</td><td>14</td><td>18</td></tr>\n","images":["<img src=\"grf/kt.gif\" width=\"150\" height=\"75\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Kara-Tur (Forgotten Realms)\" title=\"Kara-Tur (Forgotten Realms)\" align=\"right\">","<img src=\"img/spirfolk.gif\" alt=\"Spirit Folk\" title=\"Spirit Folk\" border=\"0\" width=\"300\" height=\"360\" style=\"text-align:right;\" align=\"right\">","<img src=\"grf/add2_01.gif\" width=\"200\" height=\"56\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Advanced Dungeons & Dragons 2nd Edition\">"],"setting":"Kara-Tur (Forgotten Realms)","statblock":{"Bamboo Spirit Folk":{"Activity Cycle":"Any","Alignment":"Lawful good or neutral","Armor Class":"10","Climate/Terrain":"Tropical, subtropical, and temperate forests and jungles","Damage/Attack":"By weapon","Diet":"Omnivore","Frequency":"Uncommon","Hit Dice":"1","Intelligence":"Very to genius (12-18)","Magic Resistance":"See below","Morale":"Elite (13)","Movement":"12","No. Appearing":"1-10","No. of Attacks":"1","Organization":"Clans","Size":"M (5' tall)","Special Attacks":"See below","Special Defenses":"See below","THAC0":"20","Treasure":"Individual: L,N; Clan: I","XP Value":"175"},"River Spirit Folk":{"Activity Cycle":"Any","Alignment":"Neutral good","Armor Class":"10","Climate/Terrain":"Tropical, subtropical, and temperate rivers","Damage/Attack":"By weapon","Diet":"Omnivore","Frequency":"Uncommon","Hit Dice":"1","Intelligence":"Very to genius (12-18)","Magic Resistance":"See below","Morale":"Elite (13)","Movement":"12, Sw 12","No. Appearing":"1-10","No. of Attacks":"1","Organization":"Clans","Size":"M (5' tall)","Special Attacks":"See below","Special Defenses":"See below","THAC0":"20","Treasure":"Individual: N,Q; Clan: C","XP Value":"175"},"Sea Spirit Folk":{"Activity Cycle":"Any","Alignment":"Chaotic good","Armor Class":"10","Climate/Terrain":"Tropical, subtropical, and temperate ocean","Damage/Attack":"By weapon","Diet":"Omnivore","Frequency":"Uncommon","Hit Dice":"1","Intelligence":"Very to genius (12-18)","Magic Resistance":"See below","Morale":"Elite (13)","Movement":"12, Sw 12","No. Appearing":"2-20","No. of Attacks":"1","Organization":"Clans","Size":"M (5' tall)","Special Attacks":"See below","Special Defenses":"See below","THAC0":"20","Treasure":"Individual: M,N,Q; Clan: A","XP Value":"175"}},"title":"Spirit Folk"},"sources":["2116"],"statblock_names":[],"title":"Spirit Folk","prev_key":"spirfeti","next_key":"spirfout","monster_path":"/appendix/spirfolk"}},"staticQueryHashes":[],"slicesMap":{}}
