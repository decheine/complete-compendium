While the powers listed above are the most common, some aarakocra have different or additional powers.</p><p class=\"f\">A race of intelligent, birdlike creatures living in the deepest deserts of Athas, the rare Athasian <a href=\"/appendix/aarakocr\">aarakocra</a> spends its time soaring on thermals in search of food.</p><p>The aarakocra is 7 to 8 feet tall with a wingspan of 20 feet or more. Because of its large wingspan, an aarakocra can carry as much as 75% of its own body weight and still fly easily. An aarakocra can fly a short distance carrying a burden equaling 125% of its own body weight. The average body weight of a full grown male is 100 pounds and a female is 85 pounds.</p><p>Each wing has a &ldquo;hand&rdquo; at its midpoint, consisting of three fingers and an opposable thumb. The fourth finger forms the rigid leading edge of the wing. In flight the hands cannot be used, but on the ground the aarakocra can use its hands almost as a human would. The aarakocra's body is protected by a thin bony plate on the chest, much like a solid rib cage. Talons on its legs can be used as claws and can be retracted to reveal a second set of hands, also with three fingers and an opposable thumb. Except for the chest plate, the entire skeleton is hollow and extremely fragile.</p><p>From a distance, the Athasian aarakocra resembles a huge <a href=\"/appendix/bird\">vulture</a>. Its black eyes, set in the front of the head, provide excellent vision over a long range. The plumage is generally black with a white collar for adult males and black or brown with a smaller white collar for females. Adolescents are a mixture of brown and black. The beak is large and covers most of the head. Plumage begins at the crown of the head and is darker near the head, except for the collar. Athasian aarakocra speak their own language and the languages of vultures and other large birds. Some speak the common tongue (5% to 10% chance depending on how deep in the wastelands a tribe lives).</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Combat:</b> Aarakocra can fight in the air or on the ground. They prefer aerial combat since their bones are too fragile to withstand a solid blow from a human-sized opponent. In combat against creatures on the ground, they prefer to fly over their victim and drop weighted nets. Some aarakocra use darts to harass ground-based opponents.</p><p>If their opponents can fly, the aarakocra generally forgo the use of the net, although large groups sometimes use nets on flying creatures. Normally, aarakocra attack flying creatures with long spears, diving from above and allowing the momentum to carry the spear through the target. Such an attack doubles the damage if the aarakocra have been able to dive at least 50 feet. Only the very largest aarakocra can carry more than one of these spears, they can attack with both at once with no penalty, causing double damage on each strike. All diving attacks are made at +4 and should be treated as a charge attack. All other penalties and restrictions of charge attacks apply.</p><p>The effect of the aarakocra's nets depends on if the opponent is flying at the time it becomes entangled. Creatures on the ground that are hit by a net are entangled and unable to participate in any combat until they make a successful Strength check to get free of the net. Flying creatures hit by a net can no longer fly and immediately begin falling. If they cannot escape the net or use some magical means to arrest the fall, normal falling damage applies.</p><p>Unless victims are entangled in nets, aarakocra are cautious in ground combat. If the aarakocra outnumber their opponents they advance in a straight line and thrust with their spears. If outnumbered, or the opponents are particularly tough, the aarakocra withdraw. Victims entangled in nets are killed or incapacitated for use as food or ransom.</p><p>Athasian aarakocra are mindful of their physical limitations as well as their comparatively low psionic abilities. They do not normally initiate psionic combat. At the first sign of psionic powers from any of their victims, however, all aarakocra that have some ability will use whatever attack and defense modes they can in an attempt to destroy the threat. Large groups of is or more aarakocra may initiate psionic combat if their leaders feel they can win quickly and avoid physical combat.</p><p>In desperation, an aarakocra can attempt to bite an opponent in combat. Because of the unwieldiness of its beak, the aarakocra has a THAC0 of 18 if attacking with this appendage. Further, the birdman causes only 1d2 points of damage with the beak.</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Habitat/Society:</b> Athasian aarakocra live in tribes with 6-20 (2d8+4) members, depending on the prestige of the leader. The largest tribe ever recorded had 50 members. The tribal hunting territory depends on the size of the tribe, usually about 500 square miles for a tribe of 10 members. There are no rigid boundaries between tribes and border disputes are not uncommon.</p><p>Alignments of tribe members are similar to the alignment of the leader. A tribe that has a leader who is neutral good may have neutral good, chaotic good, lawful good, and true neutral members. A predominantly evil tribe does not recognize boundaries with other tribes and treats other tribes as inferior beings to be eliminated.</p><p>Athasian aarakocra aren't happy in enclosed spaces, but they they take refuge in a cave or building if necessary.</p><p>Nonevil tribes live in rocky aeries in the highest peaks they can find. Evil tribes are normally nomadic and use an aerie made by another tribe if they need to remain in an area for a long time, even if they have to evict the tribe that made the nest.</p><p>Aarakocra aren't friendly toward intruders in their territory, especially caravans. They try to extract a toll from the caravan for passage through the desert. Good-aligned tribes allow unhindered passage of caravans that pay a tribute. If someone refuses to pay the tribute, the aarakocra try to capture scouts or outriders from the party and hold them until an even larger tribute is paid. The payment may be either livestock or shiny objects. Aarakocra are smart enough not to be taken in by glass baubles instead of gems, although they cannot tell the difference between the more common gems and the rare ones.</p><p>Evil tribes ask for tribute and often attack a caravan whether it pays or not. Aarakocra always demand shiny objects such as stones. These tribes find humans and demihumans to be quite tasty and prefer them to other food.</p><p>Good-aligned tribes of aarakocra sometimes return a lost traveler to the edge of the desert after first removing any valuables the traveler may be carrying. On very rare occasions a tribe might return a lost group of travelers to the more frequently traveled parts of the desert, again after first taking any valuables as payment.</p><p>The oldest male is the leader of the tribal hunting party and has 4+4 Hit Dice. The oldest female is in charge of the tribal aerie and has 3+3 HD. In tribes that have more than 15 members, the next oldest aarakocra serves as shaman and has 3+3 HD; the shaman completes the triumvirate necessary for proper worship and the summoning of elementals. (Interestingly, no magic-using aarakocra has ever been recorded.) Tribes without a shaman cannot summon <a href=\"/appendix/element1\">air elementals</a>, which is an important part of aarakocra culture.</p><p>The shaman is the leader of the daily sun worship. Aarakocra worship the sun because it provides them with the thermals they need to soar in search of food. The shaman also leads the mystic rituals used to summon an air elemental. Summoning an air elemental is usually done only in preparation for the tribe's most sacred ceremony, the hunt. Small tribes must band together for this ceremony to allow the triumvirate to be formed.</p><p>The ceremony to summon an air elemental must be conducted at dawn and requires the oldest male and female to emit a highpitched keening whistle. The shaman conducts an intricate dance around them, simultaneously chanting an ancient summoning mantra.</p><p>The hunt is the final part of the initiation of adolescent aarakocra to adulthood and often takes the tribe far from their normal teritory. The target is always a <a href=\"/appendix/drakalsi\">silt drake</a>. The hunt is the only time the females leave the relative safety of the nest. Even an evil tribe will not interfere with a tribe on a hunt. An air elemental is often summoned to help find the drake, but never takes part in the actual combat. Although the adult members of the tribe take part in the initial phases of the combat, it is the initiates who deliver the final, killing blows to me drake. Scars from the hunt are considered a mark of pride among all aarakocra.</p><p>The females spend about eight months of the year incubating their eggs. Athasian aarakocra mate for life and a pair normally produces as many as 10 offspring. A female lays one egg a year. Constant incubation is not required because of the high daytime temperatures, so the females can maintain the nest and keep the tribe's treasure in order.</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Ecology:</b> Athasian aarakocra are high on the food chain and have no natural enemies other than <a href=\"/appendix/drakatha\">drakes</a>. Unless evil, aarakocra leave their own territory only to hunt the silt drake and return as soon as possible when the hunt is over. (Evil aarakocra attack others, as noted above.) Aarakocra eggs and hatchlings are sought after by wealthy land owners who wish to use the creatures as scouts and sentries. An egg can bring as much as 10 cp in Tyr's marketplace. Tribes that have had eggs or hatchlings stolen have long memories and sometimes take revenge against the thief at a later date. Captive aarakocra join any tribe they come in contact with.</p><p>Athasian aarakocra have a natural life span of 21-30 years.</p><p></p><br clear=\"all\" style=\"clear:both; height:0;\">\r\n","images":["<img src=\"grf/ds.gif\" width=\"150\" height=\"75\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Dark Sun\" title=\"Dark Sun\" align=\"right\">","<img src=\"img/aarakath.gif\" alt=\"Aarakocra (Athas)\" title=\"Aarakocra (Athas)\" border=\"0\" width=\"300\" height=\"360\" style=\"text-align:right;\" align=\"right\">","<img src=\"grf/add2_01.gif\" width=\"200\" height=\"56\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Advanced Dungeons & Dragons 2nd Edition\">"],"setting":"Dark Sun","statblock":{"Aarakocra (Athas)":{"Activity Cycle":"Day","Alignment":"Any","Armor Class":"7","Climate/Terrain":"Deep desert","Damage/Attack":"1d3/1d3 or by weapon","Diet":"Carnivore","Frequency":"Rare","Hit Dice":"2+2","Intelligence":"Average (8-10)","Magic Resistance":"Nil","Morale":"Steady (11)","Movement":"6, Fl 36 (C)","No. Appearing":"1d10","No. of Attacks":"2","Organization":"Tribal","Size":"M (20'+ wingspan)","Special Attacks":"Nil","Special Defenses":"Nil","THAC0":"17","Treasure":"Varies","XP Value":"65"}},"title":"Aarakocra (Athas)"},"sources":["2433"],"statblock_names":[],"title":"Aarakocra (Athas)","prev_key":"zygraat","next_key":"aarakocr","monster_path":"/appendix/aarakath"}}},"pageContext":{"monster_key":"slaalord","monster_data":{"TSR":["Dragon221"],"fullBody":"  <table cellspacing=\"0\" cellpadding=\"0\"><tr class=\"bk\"><th> </th><th class=\"cn\">Ssendam</th><th class=\"cn\">Ygorl</th><th class=\"cn\">Chourst</th><th class=\"cn\">Rennbuu</th></tr><tr><th>Climate/Terrain:</th>  <td>Limbo</td><td>Limbo</td><td>Limbo</td><td>Limbo</td></tr><tr><th>Frequency:</th>        <td>Unique</td><td>Unique</td><td>Unique</td><td>Unique</td></tr><tr><th>Organization:</th>     <td>Solitary</td><td>Planar Ruler</td><td>Solitary</td><td>Solitary</td></tr><tr><th>Activity Cycle:</th>   <td>Any</td><td>Any</td><td>Any</td><td>Any</td></tr><tr><th>Diet:</th>             <td>Omnivorous</td><td>Omnivorous</td><td>Omnivorous</td><td>Omnivorous</td></tr><tr><th>Intelligence:</th>     <td>Non (0)</td><td>Supergenius (22)</td><td>Genius (19)</td><td>Supergenius (20)</td></tr><tr><th>Treasure:</th>         <td>Nil</td><td>V (x4)</td><td>Nil</td><td>Y, Z</td></tr><tr><th>Alignment:</th>        <td>Chaotic Neutral</td><td>Chaotic Neutral</td><td>Chaotic Neutral</td><td>Chaotic Neutral</td></tr><tr><th>No. Appearing:</th>    <td>1</td><td>1</td><td>1</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><th>Armor Class:</th>      <td>-10</td><td>-9</td><td>-9</td><td>-7</td></tr><tr><th>Movement:</th>         <td>18</td><td>12</td><td>12</td><td>12</td></tr><tr><th>Hit Dice:</th>         <td>41, 251 hp</td><td>35, 220 hp</td><td>28, 188 hp</td><td>26, 174 hp</td></tr><tr><th>THAC0:</th>            <td>1</td><td>1</td><td>3</td><td>3</td></tr><tr><th>No. of Attacks:</th>   <td>3 or 4</td><td>3 or by weapon</td><td>3</td><td>3</td></tr><tr><th>Damage/Attack:</th>    <td>3d10+11/3d10+11/2d20</td><td>3d8+9/3d8+9/2d12 or 2d12+11(x4)</td><td>3d8+8/3d8+8/2d12 or 8d6 + 9 with scythe</td><td>3d6 + 7/3d6 + 7/2d10</td></tr><tr><th>Special Attacks:</th>  <td>Spells</td><td>Spells</td><td>Spells, Instability</td><td>Spells, Transmutation</td></tr><tr><th>Special Defenses:</th> <td>Immunities, +4 or better weapon to hit</td><td>Immunities, +3 or better weapon to hit</td><td>Immunities, +3 or better weapon to hit</td><td>Immunities, +2 or better weapon to hit</td></tr><tr><th>Magic Resistance:</th> <td>90%</td><td>95%</td><td>80%</td><td>85%</td></tr><tr><th>Size:</th>             <td>H (20' tall)</td><td>H (15' tall)</td><td>H (22' tall)</td><td>L (12' tall)</td></tr><tr><th>Morale:</th>           <td>Fearless (20)</td><td>Fearless (20)</td><td>Fearless (19)</td><td>Fearless (19)</td></tr><tr><th>XP Value:</th>         <td>47,000</td><td>37,000</td><td>28,000</td><td>25,000</td></tr></table><p class=\"f\">The closest things that the <a href=\"/appendix/slaad\">slaadi</a> have to deities are the self-styled Slaad Lords. These lords are neither deity nor demigod but are, however, powerful beings in their own right, much like the Abyssal Lords and the Lords of the Nine.</p><p>As the mirror image to the rigid order of Mechanus, Limbo is a plane of unrestrained chaos. Here anarchy crushes law, randomness replaces predictability, freedom usurps enslavement to rules, and individuality triumphs over conformity. As natives of Limbo, the slaadi exemplify chaotic neutral behavior in all its forms. Inherently free, slaadi revel in unrestrained chaos. Real freedom does not exist, however, for the weaker red and blue slaadi, because they are constantly bullied and dominated by the stronger slaadi. True freedom exists solely for the ultimately powerful. This is more obvious with the mightier green, gray, and death slaadi, who are better able to impose their will on the lesser slaadi precisely because of their enhanced abilities. When any slaad can more freely accomplish what it wishes and not what others wish of it, that slaad defines itself as an individual to a greater degree. But no slaad could hope to become a true individual if it is part of a rank.</p><p>To escape this structure, some death slaadi drive themselves to explore an aspect of chaos that they hope will grant them a unique identity and endow them with incredible abilities. During this time of investigation (a little understood and extremely perilous process), a death slaad may leave the ranks of slaad conformity to become a Slaad Lord - a unique being infused with power and chaotic purpose. To date, only four death slaadi have achieved this status. By ascending to their new level, Slaad Lords become the embodiment of their own particular brand of chaos, and no two Slaad Lords share a similar expression of chaos.</p><p>The lifespan of the slaadi varies. Inexplicably and quite mysteriously, when a slaad has reached a certain age, it instinctively travels deep into Limbo. A lucky few advance in status to a higher form of slaad, but the majority never return and presumably dissolve into their base essences to merge with the primal forces of the plane. Not so for the Slaad Lords, whose unique status also grants them immortality. They need never worry about being reduced to their base essence unless slain in combat. For this reason, Slaad Lords never fight to the death. In fact, it is believed that no Slaad Lord has been slain in mortal combat - yet. Whether or not a slain Slaad Lord's essence can reform into its original death slaad self, or even return to any form at all, is debatable. Lesser and greater slaadi slain in combat are forever destroyed, but this may not be the case for the Slaad Lords. Perhaps nothing is impossible for the Lords of Chaos on the plane of ultimate possibility.</p><h2>Ssendam, Lord of Insanity</h2><p class=\"f\">Ssendam, Slaad Lord of Insanity, is the oldest and most powerful Slaad Lord. She floats freely in the roiling chaos-stuff of Limbo, a huge golden amoeba devouring anything that comes too close. Her glistening gelatinous shape supports four fullydeveloped pseudopods. Ssendam has never been known to leave Limbo, and it is said that she is forever contacting the minds of mortals on other planes to render them mad. She seems to have little concern for the slaadi race, or for anything else, for that matter. Ssendam has two other forms, but she rarely appears in them. She assumes the form of a huge golden slaad when near the Spawning Stone. Her other form is of a golden-skinned female elf warrior. In game terms, Ssendam has Strength of 23, Dexterity of 16, Constitution 18, Intelligence and Wisdom of 0 (unratable), and a Charisma of 18.</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Combat:</b> An incredibly vicious combatant, Ssendam is nearly unbeatable. Those who don't flee have assuredly doomed themselves. In her amoeba shape, Ssendam fights with her four pseudopods and may target up to four opponents each round. Any opponent hit by three pseudopods in a single round is held fast and drawn inside Ssendam. A victim \"eaten\" this way suffers 3d12 hp corrosive damage per round from Ssendam's digestive acids. Eaten characters cannot take any physical action while inside Ssendam. Any ingested character who is reduced to 0 hp is completely dissolved, making resurrection impossible. When fighting in her slaad form, Ssendam's powerful claws and bite bring down her opponents. In either form, a victim hit by more than one pseudopod or both claws (depending on Ssendam's current form) must make a successful saving throw vs. spells or suffer the effects of a <i>mindshatter</i> spell (from the <i>Tome of Magic</i>).</p><p>Ssendam has the following abilities, usable at will: <i>cloudkill</i>, <i>continual light</i>, <i>darkness 15' radius</i>, <i>detect magic</i> and <i>invisibility</i>, <i>energy drain</i> (3/day), <i>ESP</i>, <i>flamestrike</i> (double strength), <i>know alignment</i>, <i>locate object and person</i>, <i>any power word</i> (3/day), <i>shapechange</i> to amoeba or <a href=\"/appendix/elf\">elf</a> form, <i>symbol of</i> insanity (3/day), <i>teleport without error</i>, <i>unholy word</i>, and <i>windwalk</i>. The Lord of Insanity can <i>gate</i> in 1 death slaad per turn with a 100% chance of success. Ssendam is immune to psionics and enchantment/charm spells that affect the mind.</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Followers & Resources:</b> Ssendam has no followers, at least none that she cares for. All slaadi and other inhabitants of Limbo who know of her existence avoid Ssendam, lest they become her next meal. Visitors to Limbo are cautioned to avoid any large amorphous yellow goo. It is rumored that Ssendam grows strong by feeding on the psychic trauma of insane beings, especially those in whom she caused madness.</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Plots & Goals:</b> When Ssendam was a green slaad, she saw insanity as the perfect expression of chaos. Obsessed with madness, she imbued herself with its essence to become a Slaad Lord. In her own way, she contributes to chaos by introducing insanity to stable environments. After all, crazies rarely do anything lawful. By introducing madness into an army, a family, or a village, she guarantees that chaos inevitably follows. Ssendam does not advance any goal except to render the multiverse insane, one being at a time. For the most part, she remains an enigma, and her methods for reaching out across the planes to touch the minds of others from Limbo is unknown.</p><p>A final odd characteristic of Ssendam is her apparent tie to the Spawning Stone. At times she is seen floating around the Stone in her slaad form. Based only on an old legend, sages suspect that Ssendam is the self-appointed guardian of the Spawning Stone. The legend tells of a large pack of vrock who gathered at the Spawning Stone to eradicate the death slaad once and for all. The numerous vrock had overpowered and killed four of the death slaadi when a massive, golden slaad suddenly appeared and dove into the crowd of vrock. Ssendam bit the head off one vrock, ripped another in half, squashed a third under her foot - all in the first flurry of combat. When the golden slaad was finished, she allowed the sole surviving vrock to limp back to the Abyss. Much time passed before the tanar'ri returned to Limbo.</p><h2>Ygorl, Lord of Entropy</h2><p class=\"f\">Technically considered the planar ruler of Limbo, the reclusive Ygorl resides in an ever-changing keep that drifts haphazardly in Limbo's chaotic currents. The other Slaad Lords have never challenged his authority, probably because they are too chaotic to concern themselves with ruling anything, or possibly because Ygorl makes few demands on his domain.</p><p>Ygorl resembles a huge, skeletal, winged slaad of blackened, charred bones. He can shapechange into the form of a darkskinned human male warrior adorned in adamantine armor, but he takes this shape only when outside Limbo. Ygorl's mount is the great wyrm Shkiv, an ancient chaotic neutral <a href=\"/appendix/dragmbra\">brass dragon</a> of maximum abilities. Unlike most brass dragons, Shkiv is coldly neutral and uncaring except in matters concerning his lord. Ygorl was the second Slaad Lord to emerge after Ssendam, and he appears to be the second most powerful. Ygorl has a Strength of 21, Dexterity 18, Constitution 17, Intelligence 22, Wisdom 19, and Charisma 12.</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Combat:</b> Ygorl has the following abilities usable at will: <i>advanced illusion</i>, <i>blink</i>, <i>darkness 15' radius</i>, <i>death fog</i> (3/day), <i>detect magic</i>, <i>detect invisibility</i>, <i>energy drain</i> (3/day), <i>ESP</i>, <i>fear</i>, <i>flamestrike</i> (double strength), <i>know alignment</i>, <i>continual light</i>, <i>phantasmal killer</i>, <i>power word kill</i> (3/day), <i>shapechange</i> into human form, <i>sleep</i>, <i>symbol of hopelessness</i> (3/day) and <i>unholy word</i>. Ygorl can <i>gate</i> in either one death slaad or two gray slaadi (35%/65% of either) once per turn. He wields an <i>adamantine scythe +5</i> viciously in battle. The scythe has glowing runes on its handle that spell out \"DEATH\" in the ancient slaad tongue. Any being struck by the scythe must make a saving throw vs. death magic or be instantly slain or disintegrated (50% chance of either effect). Even with a successful saving throw, the scythe still delivers 8d6 hp slicing damage to the victim. If Ygorl wills it, the scythe disintegrates inanimate objects with a touch. Ygorl is immune to death magic and all other harmful necromantic magic. Shkiv is always at his master's side and fights to the death for Ygorl, using his abilities as a great wyrm to full effect.</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Followers & Resources:</b> To Ygorl, all slaadi are living tools under his dominion, meant to bring chaos and entropy to the multiverse. Ygorl has no true followers, but most slaadi would rather obey Ygorl's orders than be swallowed whole for ignoring them. Ygorl rules in this manner as best as one can in a plane of absolute chaotic neutrality.</p><p>Ages ago when Ygorl became a Slaad Lord, he reasoned that even chaos needed a focus, a source from which to flow, and so he created the Spawning Stone. Derived from the purest essence of Limbo and given shape and stability with powerful enchantments, Ygorl designed the Spawning Stone to contain the essence of the slaad race, binding all slaadi to it. The existence of the Spawning Stone has provided a point of convergence for the slaadi, a gathering place for them to rally around and greatly increase their numbers.</p><p>Ygorl's fortress is one of the most unusual structures in the bizarre landscape of Limbo. The building's appearance changes constantly to suit the whim of its lord; one moment it appears as a rough hewn cavern, the next as a desecrated temple of broken marble. Ygorl's mental control over the fortress is absolute. The building literally shapes itself to his will. Any person attempting to flee the fortress soon discovers that all corridors eventually lead wherever Ygorl wants them to lead.</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Plots & Goals:</b> Death, decay, and disorganization are the elements of entropy that Ygorl most desires to force down the throat of the multiverse. He believes that this brand of chaos is best delivered to other realms by the truest agents of chaotic neutrality - the slaadi.</p><p>As the Lord of Entropy, Ygorl directs the death slaadi to organize the mass spawnings of the blues and reds in Limbo. These hordes of slaadi are then unleashed on the battlefields of the Blood Wars and the prime worlds to incubate the wounded with slaadi egg-pellets. Through this uniquely entrepreneurial style, Ygorl oversees the ever-growing slaadi race and ensures the spread of chaos.</p><p>Of all the Slaad Lords, the secretive Ygorl desires most to discourage the widely held notion that the Lords are actually deities. All slaadi have been commanded by the Lord of Entropy to devour any cutter who inquires about \"slaadi deities.\" Ygorl believes that if knowledge of Slaad Lords becomes too widespread, planars and primes alike will think that they are just another caste of slaadi to toy with. Ygorl cannot be bothered with fending off the inevitable host of adventurers that would seek to best a unique slaad. Consequently, Ygorl seeks to keep the number of Slaad Lords very low; the multiverse is full of hotheads who have nothing better to do than try to prove something. As a result, Ygorl seeks out and consumes death slaadi who seem close to evolving into a Slaad Lord. Through forced anonymity and low numbers, Ygorl strives to perpetuate the mystery of the Slaad Lords.</p><p>Ygorl ignores Ssendam (rather easily, actually), enjoys Chourst's company at times, and despises Rennbuu because he has not yet figured out how the young upstart gave him the laugh to become a Slaad Lord. Ygorl would have devoured Rennbuu as a death slaad rather than allow him to develop. However, Ygorl gives the colorful Rennbuu a wide berth because he fears his ability to alter slaadi. Ygorl has been grooming one death slaad, Sorel, as his lieutenant, despite his personal standing order to consume aspiring death slaadi. In the near future, Ygorl hopes to unleash Sorel, the newest Slaad Lord, as the Lord of Anarchy and Limbo's latest instrument of chaos. Sorel, a true anarchist, enjoys employing secret agents to spread anarchy via terrorism and acts of sabotage designed to break down lawful societies. She is quite popular with the leaders of the Revolutionary League, many of whom are often involved in her deadly schemes.</p><h2>Chourst, Lord of Randomness</h2><img src=\"/img/spc/slaalord1.gif\" alt=\"Chourst, Slaad Lord of Randomness\" title=\"Chourst, Slaad Lord of Randomness\" border=\"0\" width=\"300\" height=\"360\" style=\"text-align:left;\" align=\"left\"><p class=\"f\">Chourst is the incarnation of chaotic unpredictability, the erratic Lord of Randomness. At one moment Chourst is tearing some githzerai to pieces, the next moment he is stopping to smell a flower. Chourst remains in Limbo most of the time because he finds the primal soup very soothing. He enjoys occasional forays into other planes for a change of scenery and a new place to wreak havoc. Chourst is the third of the Slaad Lords and cares little of the affairs of other slaadi. He is too chaotic and independent to worry about anything other than his own whimsical passions. Chourst appears as a gangly, 20'-tall, chalk-white slaad. Chourst's other forms are unknown. The Lord of Randomness has a Strength of 20, Dexterity 18, Constitution 18, Intelligence 19, Wisdom 18, and Charisma 15.</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Combat:</b> Chourst is an odd combatant, because most fights don't hold his attention long enough for him to finish them. Instead, he forsakes the battle halfway through for something else that catches his eye. However, Chourst never allows himself to come to harm by ignoring a dangerous threat, and he disables or kills anything he perceives as harmful. Chourst has the following spell-like abilities, usable once per round at will: <i>advanced illusion</i>, <i>astral spell</i>, <i>chaos</i>, <i>cloudkill</i>, <i>confusion</i>, <i>darkness 15'</i>, <i>detect magic</i>, <i>ESP</i>, <i>fear</i>, <i>flamestrike</i>, <i>light</i>, <i>solid fog</i>, any <i>symbol</i> (3/day), and <i>windwalk</i>. Chourst's very presence dissolves chaos-shaped land in Limbo (affecting all land within a 30' radius of the Slaad Lord). Dissolved land reverts to its primal form. Consequently, spells cast within 300 of Chourst always trigger a wild surge, even outside Limbo, to which Chourst is immune. A successful hit or bite by Chourst confers corporeal instability to the victim, who must make a saving throw vs. spells or suffer effects identical to the touch of a <a href=\"chaobeas\">chaos beast</ah>. (See the <i>Planes of Chaos</i> monster booklet for details.) This affects all living creatures except <a href=\"/appendix/modron\">modrons</a>, who must save vs. spells or become Chaotic Neutral (creating a rogue modron). In Limbo, Chourst can <i>gate</i> in either one gray slaad (40% of the time) or two green slaadi (60% chance) once every turn with a 90% probability of success.</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Followers & Resources:</b> Chourst has neither followers nor resources. Knowledgeable members of the Xaositect faction admire the Slaad Lord for his truer understanding and apparent appreciation of chaotic randomness. Even the Xaositects, however, prefer to admire Chourst's perfection from afar.</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Plots & Goals:</b> Chourst has only one desire: to indulge himself indiscriminately. This behavior is more often destructive than anything else, because Chourst lacks the focus to create or build anything of significance. Ygorl approves of Chourst's senseless behavior because it contributes to chaos and entropy. Outside Limbo, a wildly zigzagging trail of haphazard destruction might just be the recent passing of the Lord of Randomness.</p><p>Chourst revels in his power to disrupt chaos-shaped terrain and frequently performs cannonball jumps through <a href=\"/appendix/githzera\">githzerai</a> cities and other towns in Limbo just for entertainment. Affected land can be reassembled but not usually quick enough to avoid significant harm. When the githzerai speak of an unexpected and unpleasant event they often say \"It was like a visit from Chourst.\"</p><p>Chourst's one and only visit to Mechanus caused incredible mayhem and disorder on that plane. Rogue modrons of all sorts popped up throughout the plane; weeding them out was painstakingly work for the pentadrone police. Chourst barely escaped the plane alive after Mechanus' most important ruler, Primus the One, personally appeared to deal with the interloping Slaad Lord. Chourst is still a dangerous and wanted outlaw in Mechanus.</p><h2>Rennbuu, Lord of Colors</h2><p class=\"f\">Rennbuu is the flamboyant and stylish Lord of Colors. He appears as a 12'-tall, gaunt slaad whose skin color glows and swirls in scintillating, radiant hues. Unlike normal slaadi, Rennbuu sports a long, frazzled mane of stark white hair. The newest of the Slaad Lords, Rennbuu is perhaps the most cruelly sadistic and maliciously capricious of them all. Rennbuu roams Limbo and the planes changing the colors of things and beings. Most experienced travelers in the multiverse report crossing paths with at least one victim of Rennbuu's artful hand during their many travels, for the Lord of Colors is a very busy Slaad Lord. Rennbuu has a Strength of 19, Dexterity 19, Constitution 18, Intelligence 18, Wisdom 19, and Charisma 20.</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Combat:</b> Rennbuu prefers to fight tough battles with spells and magic items, but he will not hesitate to use both claws and a bite when closing in melee. Rennbuu has the following spell-like abilities, usable once per round at will: <i>advanced illusion</i>, <i>color spray</i>, <i>darkness 15' radius</i>, <i>ESP</i>, <i>flamestrike</i> (3/day), <i>know alignment</i>, <i>light</i>, <i>planeshift</i>, <i>prismatic spray</i> (2/day), <i>prismatic wall</i> (2/day), <i>rainbow pattern</i>, any <i>symbol</i>, (3/day) and <i>windwalk</i>. The Lord of Colors can <i>gate</i> in 6-8 red slaadi (50% of the time) or 5-6 blue slaadi (50% chance once) per turn with a 95% chance of success.</p><p>Rennbuu can magically transmute any creature's or object's natural color into another color of his choosing simply by touching it. Color changes can be either permanent or temporary, and they are dispelled only by a wish. Temporary effects wear off at a random time: sometimes seconds, sometimes in months or in years. The new color can be any hue and pattern that Rennbuu chooses, including solids, spots, stripes, etc. The pretentious and splashy Rennbuu also enjoys taunting his foes in battle by ridiculing combatants while flailing away with sayings like: \"There, you look much better in (blood) red,\" \"Your armor is cheap but it suits you,' and \"I really hate that color on you -  try this.\" Additionally, Rennbuu is immune to all illusion/phantasm spells. On the plane of Limbo, Rennbuu wields an awesome power that makes all greater slaadi fearful: He can transform a slaad of one type (color) into another type</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Followers & Resources:</b> Rennbuu maintains a sizable staff of red and blue slaadi in his pristine and impregnable gallery deep inside Limbo. This staff obeys their master's will mostly out of fear, but partially because they hope to be promoted to a green slaad or better by pleasing their lord. Rennbuu's gallery is filled with his past and present artwork. Entire rooms, even whole wings are devoted to his creations. These pieces are carefully guarded as Rennbuu is proud and possessive of his many accomplishments and likes to see his work preserved. Any art that Rennbuu finds especially pleasing is brought back to his gallery for display.</p><p>Most red and blue slaadi revere Rennbuu as the only being who can change their lot for the better because of his ability to transform slaadi. Green, gray, and death slaadi avoid the Lord of Colors lest they be turned into lesser slaadi. Rennbuu could simply not care less.</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Plots & Goals:</b> Rennbuu enjoys the mayhem that results when colors change. He takes a perverse pleasure in affecting a being's life, whether for better or worse. Out of pure mischief, Rennbuu often selects colors that he knows will cause the most harm (white <a href=\"/appendix/elfdrow\">drow</a>, purple <a href=\"/appendix/gnome\">gnomes</a>, plaid <a href=\"/appendix/dwarf\">dwarves</a> and so on). Rennbuu would color the whole multiverse his own way if given the chance. In one typical tale, a horrified <a href=\"/appendix/dragmgol\">gold dragon</a> returned to her lair to find that her five hatchlings had taken on the colors of the chromatic <a href=\"/appendix/dragon\">dragons</a> - <a href=\"/appendix/dragcbla\">black</a>, <a href=\"/appendix/dragcblu\">blue</a>, <a href=\"/appendix/dragcgre\">green</a>, <a href=\"/appendix/dragcred\">red</a>, and <a href=\"/appendix/dragcwhi\">white</a>. The hatchlings were still gold dragons in every way except for their scales' color. Needless to say, the hatchlings all led very difficult lives.</p><p>Like many artists, Rennbuu is occasionally gripped by frantic creative moods. During these moods, the Lord of Colors devotes all his time and energy to one particular activity. For instance, in his \"Nature Period,\" Rennbuu used a mountain and an entire forest of gigantic size to create a bizarre monument to Mother Nature. Rennbuu also appreciates style and fashion, and he sometimes spares a village or passerby who displays good taste from his artistic touch. He is knowledgeable about many planar and prime art forms and can converse for hours with anyone who possesses expertise in any art.</p><p></p><br clear=\"all\" style=\"clear:both; height:0;\">\r\n","images":["<img src=\"grf/dr.gif\" width=\"150\" height=\"75\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Dragon Magazine\" title=\"Dragon Magazine\" align=\"right\">","<img src=\"/img/spc/slaalord1.gif\" alt=\"Chourst, Slaad Lord of Randomness\" title=\"Chourst, Slaad Lord of Randomness\" border=\"0\" width=\"300\" height=\"360\" style=\"text-align:left;\" align=\"left\">","<img src=\"grf/tsr_sm.png\" width=\"56\" height=\"59\" border=\"0\" alt=\"TSR\">"],"setting":"Dragon Magazine","statblock":{"Chourst":{"Activity Cycle":"Any","Alignment":"Chaotic Neutral","Armor Class":"-9","Climate/Terrain":"Limbo","Damage/Attack":"3d8+8/3d8+8/2d12 or 8d6 + 9 with scythe","Diet":"Omnivorous","Frequency":"Unique","Hit Dice":"28, 188 hp","Intelligence":"Genius (19)","Magic Resistance":"80%","Morale":"Fearless (19)","Movement":"12","No. Appearing":"1","No. of Attacks":"3","Organization":"Solitary","Size":"H (22' tall)","Special Attacks":"Spells, Instability","Special Defenses":"Immunities, +3 or better weapon to hit","THAC0":"3","Treasure":"Nil","XP Value":"28,000"},"Rennbuu":{"Activity Cycle":"Any","Alignment":"Chaotic Neutral","Armor Class":"-7","Climate/Terrain":"Limbo","Damage/Attack":"3d6 + 7/3d6 + 7/2d10","Diet":"Omnivorous","Frequency":"Unique","Hit Dice":"26, 174 hp","Intelligence":"Supergenius (20)","Magic Resistance":"85%","Morale":"Fearless (19)","Movement":"12","No. Appearing":"1","No. of Attacks":"3","Organization":"Solitary","Size":"L (12' tall)","Special Attacks":"Spells, Transmutation","Special Defenses":"Immunities, +2 or better weapon to hit","THAC0":"3","Treasure":"Y, Z","XP Value":"25,000"},"Ssendam":{"Activity Cycle":"Any","Alignment":"Chaotic Neutral","Armor Class":"-10","Climate/Terrain":"Limbo","Damage/Attack":"3d10+11/3d10+11/2d20","Diet":"Omnivorous","Frequency":"Unique","Hit Dice":"41, 251 hp","Intelligence":"Non (0)","Magic Resistance":"90%","Morale":"Fearless (20)","Movement":"18","No. Appearing":"1","No. of Attacks":"3 or 4","Organization":"Solitary","Size":"H (20' tall)","Special Attacks":"Spells","Special Defenses":"Immunities, +4 or better weapon to hit","THAC0":"1","Treasure":"Nil","XP Value":"47,000"},"Ygorl":{"Activity Cycle":"Any","Alignment":"Chaotic Neutral","Armor Class":"-9","Climate/Terrain":"Limbo","Damage/Attack":"3d8+9/3d8+9/2d12 or 2d12+11(x4)","Diet":"Omnivorous","Frequency":"Unique","Hit Dice":"35, 220 hp","Intelligence":"Supergenius (22)","Magic Resistance":"95%","Morale":"Fearless (20)","Movement":"12","No. Appearing":"1","No. of Attacks":"3 or by weapon","Organization":"Planar Ruler","Size":"H (15' tall)","Special Attacks":"Spells","Special Defenses":"Immunities, +3 or better weapon to hit","THAC0":"1","Treasure":"V (x4)","XP Value":"37,000"}},"title":"Slaad Lords of Chaos"},"sources":["Dragon221"],"statblock_names":[],"title":"Slaad Lords of Chaos","prev_key":"slaad","next_key":"slasrath","monster_path":"/appendix/slaalord"}},"staticQueryHashes":[],"slicesMap":{}}
