When he died, he became undead, continuing to rule the ranks of the walking dead. His death is often voluntary, a self-sacrifice made to gain a prolonged existence.</p><p>A king-wight looks like a well-preserved corpse. At nighttime, in artificial light, it can even be mistaken for a living being. It wears its favorite armor and carries its favorite weapons, and is often decorated with expensive jewelry. While a king-wight can appear almost alive, the stench of the grave follows it and gives it away.</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Combat:</b> A king-wight fights much the same after death as it did in life. It wears <i>chain mail +3</i> and wields a <i>sword +2</i> (any type possible). A king-wight was an exceptional human and continues to have excellent attributes even in death. Its attribute statistics are: S 18/50, D 17, C 16, I 15, W 13, Ch 15 (to undead only). These scores and the magical items are already calculated into the king-wight's statistics.</p><p>When it becomes undead, a king-wight gains many special abilities. A successful attack can drain two life levels from a victim, as per a <a href=\"/appendix/vampire\">vampire</a>. Any victim completely drained of life points by the king+wight becomes a full-strength wight under the control of the king-wight.</p><p>A king-wight also has the ability to cast <i>spectral force</i> and <i>confusion</i> spells, one spell per round, without limit. It can <i>teleport</i> once per day, but only to or from its barrow home. When the king-wight is destroyed, the action causes an <i>earthquake</i> (as per the clerical spell, at the 14th-level of effect), centered on the king-wight's body, in 4-16 rounds. Since a king-wight is often encountered in its underground barrow, such an earthquake can be especially deadly.</p><p>A king-wight is so powerful that any individual of a level lower than the kingwight must make a saving throw vs. spells or flee in panic from fear. The following spells or attack forms have no effect on a king-wight: <i>charm</i>, <i>sleep</i>, <i>enfeeblement</i>, <i>polymorph</i>, cold, electricity, insanity, and death magic. A <i>raise dead</i> spell turns the king-wight into a normal 12th-level fighter unless a saving throw vs. spells is made.</p><p>A cleric attempting to turn a king-wight should use the &ldquo;special&rdquo; column. A king wight can be harmed only by magical weapons.</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Habitat/Society:</b> A king-wight retains its court, even after death. It is often surrounded by its faithful warriors, who were turned into wights by the king-wight and remain under their master's control. A king-wight encountered in its barrow usually controls 4-32 normal wights.</p><p>A king-wight delights in tricking the living. It often travels to someone's abode to flaunt its treasure and tempt heroes into searching out its lair. A king-wight may appear gracious and hospitable at times, but such appearances are illusory. In reality, the king-wight hates to give up any part of its hoarded treasure and tempts heroes only as a ploy to trap them in its underground barrow, to either slay the heroes by the sword or turn them into wight slaves.</p><br clear=\"all\" style=\"clear:both; height:0;\">\r\n","images":["<img src=\"grf/dr.gif\" width=\"150\" height=\"75\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Dragon Magazine\" title=\"Dragon Magazine\" align=\"right\">","<img src=\"img/wighking.gif\" alt=\"Wight, King-\" title=\"Wight, King-\" border=\"0\" width=\"300\" height=\"360\" style=\"text-align:right;\" align=\"right\">","<img src=\"grf/add2_01.gif\" width=\"200\" height=\"56\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Advanced Dungeons & Dragons 2nd Edition\">"],"setting":"Dragon Magazine","statblock":{"Wight, King-":{"Activity Cycle":"Night","Alignment":"Lawful evil","Armor Class":"-1","Climate/Terrain":"Any, usually subterranean","Damage/Attack":"1d8+5","Diet":"Carnivore (living beings)","Frequency":"Very rare","Hit Dice":"12+23 (77 hp)","Intelligence":"Exceptional (15)","Magic Resistance":"Nil","Morale":"Fearless (20)","Movement":"12","No. Appearing":"1","No. of Attacks":"3/2 by weapon type or 1 by touch","Organization":"Solitary, but may have followers","Size":"M (6-7')","Special Attacks":"Energy drain, wight control, spellcasting, earthquake, magical items","Special Defenses":"Immunity to some weapons and spells","THAC0":"4","Treasure":"A","XP Value":"30,000"}},"title":"Wight, King-"},"sources":["Dragon#198"],"statblock_names":[],"title":"Wight, King-","prev_key":"wiggle","next_key":"wight"}},"staticQueryHashes":[],"slicesMap":{}}
