While the powers listed above are the most common, some aarakocra have different or additional powers.</p><p class=\"f\">A race of intelligent, birdlike creatures living in the deepest deserts of Athas, the rare Athasian <a href=\"/appendix/aarakocr\">aarakocra</a> spends its time soaring on thermals in search of food.</p><p>The aarakocra is 7 to 8 feet tall with a wingspan of 20 feet or more. Because of its large wingspan, an aarakocra can carry as much as 75% of its own body weight and still fly easily. An aarakocra can fly a short distance carrying a burden equaling 125% of its own body weight. The average body weight of a full grown male is 100 pounds and a female is 85 pounds.</p><p>Each wing has a &ldquo;hand&rdquo; at its midpoint, consisting of three fingers and an opposable thumb. The fourth finger forms the rigid leading edge of the wing. In flight the hands cannot be used, but on the ground the aarakocra can use its hands almost as a human would. The aarakocra's body is protected by a thin bony plate on the chest, much like a solid rib cage. Talons on its legs can be used as claws and can be retracted to reveal a second set of hands, also with three fingers and an opposable thumb. Except for the chest plate, the entire skeleton is hollow and extremely fragile.</p><p>From a distance, the Athasian aarakocra resembles a huge <a href=\"/appendix/bird\">vulture</a>. Its black eyes, set in the front of the head, provide excellent vision over a long range. The plumage is generally black with a white collar for adult males and black or brown with a smaller white collar for females. Adolescents are a mixture of brown and black. The beak is large and covers most of the head. Plumage begins at the crown of the head and is darker near the head, except for the collar. Athasian aarakocra speak their own language and the languages of vultures and other large birds. Some speak the common tongue (5% to 10% chance depending on how deep in the wastelands a tribe lives).</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Combat:</b> Aarakocra can fight in the air or on the ground. They prefer aerial combat since their bones are too fragile to withstand a solid blow from a human-sized opponent. In combat against creatures on the ground, they prefer to fly over their victim and drop weighted nets. Some aarakocra use darts to harass ground-based opponents.</p><p>If their opponents can fly, the aarakocra generally forgo the use of the net, although large groups sometimes use nets on flying creatures. Normally, aarakocra attack flying creatures with long spears, diving from above and allowing the momentum to carry the spear through the target. Such an attack doubles the damage if the aarakocra have been able to dive at least 50 feet. Only the very largest aarakocra can carry more than one of these spears, they can attack with both at once with no penalty, causing double damage on each strike. All diving attacks are made at +4 and should be treated as a charge attack. All other penalties and restrictions of charge attacks apply.</p><p>The effect of the aarakocra's nets depends on if the opponent is flying at the time it becomes entangled. Creatures on the ground that are hit by a net are entangled and unable to participate in any combat until they make a successful Strength check to get free of the net. Flying creatures hit by a net can no longer fly and immediately begin falling. If they cannot escape the net or use some magical means to arrest the fall, normal falling damage applies.</p><p>Unless victims are entangled in nets, aarakocra are cautious in ground combat. If the aarakocra outnumber their opponents they advance in a straight line and thrust with their spears. If outnumbered, or the opponents are particularly tough, the aarakocra withdraw. Victims entangled in nets are killed or incapacitated for use as food or ransom.</p><p>Athasian aarakocra are mindful of their physical limitations as well as their comparatively low psionic abilities. They do not normally initiate psionic combat. At the first sign of psionic powers from any of their victims, however, all aarakocra that have some ability will use whatever attack and defense modes they can in an attempt to destroy the threat. Large groups of is or more aarakocra may initiate psionic combat if their leaders feel they can win quickly and avoid physical combat.</p><p>In desperation, an aarakocra can attempt to bite an opponent in combat. Because of the unwieldiness of its beak, the aarakocra has a THAC0 of 18 if attacking with this appendage. Further, the birdman causes only 1d2 points of damage with the beak.</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Habitat/Society:</b> Athasian aarakocra live in tribes with 6-20 (2d8+4) members, depending on the prestige of the leader. The largest tribe ever recorded had 50 members. The tribal hunting territory depends on the size of the tribe, usually about 500 square miles for a tribe of 10 members. There are no rigid boundaries between tribes and border disputes are not uncommon.</p><p>Alignments of tribe members are similar to the alignment of the leader. A tribe that has a leader who is neutral good may have neutral good, chaotic good, lawful good, and true neutral members. A predominantly evil tribe does not recognize boundaries with other tribes and treats other tribes as inferior beings to be eliminated.</p><p>Athasian aarakocra aren't happy in enclosed spaces, but they they take refuge in a cave or building if necessary.</p><p>Nonevil tribes live in rocky aeries in the highest peaks they can find. Evil tribes are normally nomadic and use an aerie made by another tribe if they need to remain in an area for a long time, even if they have to evict the tribe that made the nest.</p><p>Aarakocra aren't friendly toward intruders in their territory, especially caravans. They try to extract a toll from the caravan for passage through the desert. Good-aligned tribes allow unhindered passage of caravans that pay a tribute. If someone refuses to pay the tribute, the aarakocra try to capture scouts or outriders from the party and hold them until an even larger tribute is paid. The payment may be either livestock or shiny objects. Aarakocra are smart enough not to be taken in by glass baubles instead of gems, although they cannot tell the difference between the more common gems and the rare ones.</p><p>Evil tribes ask for tribute and often attack a caravan whether it pays or not. Aarakocra always demand shiny objects such as stones. These tribes find humans and demihumans to be quite tasty and prefer them to other food.</p><p>Good-aligned tribes of aarakocra sometimes return a lost traveler to the edge of the desert after first removing any valuables the traveler may be carrying. On very rare occasions a tribe might return a lost group of travelers to the more frequently traveled parts of the desert, again after first taking any valuables as payment.</p><p>The oldest male is the leader of the tribal hunting party and has 4+4 Hit Dice. The oldest female is in charge of the tribal aerie and has 3+3 HD. In tribes that have more than 15 members, the next oldest aarakocra serves as shaman and has 3+3 HD; the shaman completes the triumvirate necessary for proper worship and the summoning of elementals. (Interestingly, no magic-using aarakocra has ever been recorded.) Tribes without a shaman cannot summon <a href=\"/appendix/element1\">air elementals</a>, which is an important part of aarakocra culture.</p><p>The shaman is the leader of the daily sun worship. Aarakocra worship the sun because it provides them with the thermals they need to soar in search of food. The shaman also leads the mystic rituals used to summon an air elemental. Summoning an air elemental is usually done only in preparation for the tribe's most sacred ceremony, the hunt. Small tribes must band together for this ceremony to allow the triumvirate to be formed.</p><p>The ceremony to summon an air elemental must be conducted at dawn and requires the oldest male and female to emit a highpitched keening whistle. The shaman conducts an intricate dance around them, simultaneously chanting an ancient summoning mantra.</p><p>The hunt is the final part of the initiation of adolescent aarakocra to adulthood and often takes the tribe far from their normal teritory. The target is always a <a href=\"/appendix/drakalsi\">silt drake</a>. The hunt is the only time the females leave the relative safety of the nest. Even an evil tribe will not interfere with a tribe on a hunt. An air elemental is often summoned to help find the drake, but never takes part in the actual combat. Although the adult members of the tribe take part in the initial phases of the combat, it is the initiates who deliver the final, killing blows to me drake. Scars from the hunt are considered a mark of pride among all aarakocra.</p><p>The females spend about eight months of the year incubating their eggs. Athasian aarakocra mate for life and a pair normally produces as many as 10 offspring. A female lays one egg a year. Constant incubation is not required because of the high daytime temperatures, so the females can maintain the nest and keep the tribe's treasure in order.</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Ecology:</b> Athasian aarakocra are high on the food chain and have no natural enemies other than <a href=\"/appendix/drakatha\">drakes</a>. Unless evil, aarakocra leave their own territory only to hunt the silt drake and return as soon as possible when the hunt is over. (Evil aarakocra attack others, as noted above.) Aarakocra eggs and hatchlings are sought after by wealthy land owners who wish to use the creatures as scouts and sentries. An egg can bring as much as 10 cp in Tyr's marketplace. Tribes that have had eggs or hatchlings stolen have long memories and sometimes take revenge against the thief at a later date. Captive aarakocra join any tribe they come in contact with.</p><p>Athasian aarakocra have a natural life span of 21-30 years.</p>\n","images":["<img src=\"grf/ds.gif\" width=\"150\" height=\"75\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Dark Sun\" title=\"Dark Sun\" align=\"right\">","<img src=\"img/aarakath.gif\" alt=\"Aarakocra (Athas)\" title=\"Aarakocra (Athas)\" border=\"0\" width=\"300\" height=\"360\" style=\"text-align:right;\" align=\"right\">","<img src=\"grf/add2_01.gif\" width=\"200\" height=\"56\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Advanced Dungeons & Dragons 2nd Edition\">"],"setting":"Dark Sun","statblock":{"Aarakocra (Athas)":{"Activity Cycle":"Day","Alignment":"Any","Armor Class":"7","Climate/Terrain":"Deep desert","Damage/Attack":"1d3/1d3 or by weapon","Diet":"Carnivore","Frequency":"Rare","Hit Dice":"2+2","Intelligence":"Average (8-10)","Magic Resistance":"Nil","Morale":"Steady (11)","Movement":"6, Fl 36 (C)","No. Appearing":"1d10","No. of Attacks":"2","Organization":"Tribal","Size":"M (20'+ wingspan)","Special Attacks":"Nil","Special Defenses":"Nil","THAC0":"17","Treasure":"Varies","XP Value":"65"}},"title":"Aarakocra (Athas)"},"sources":["2433"],"statblock_names":[],"title":"Aarakocra (Athas)","prev_key":"zygraat","next_key":"aarakocr","monster_path":"/appendix/aarakath"}}},"pageContext":{"monster_key":"faerunse","monster_data":{"TSR":["3140"],"fullBody":"  <table cellspacing=\"0\" cellpadding=\"0\" style=\"column-span: all;\"><tr class=\"bk\"><th> </th><th class=\"cn\">Living Evil Faerie</th><th class=\"cn\">Undead Faerie</th><th class=\"cn\">Lussina, the Dark Queen</th></tr><tr><th>Climate/Terrain:</th>  <td>Shadow World</td><td>Shadow World</td><td>Shadow World</td></tr><tr><th>Frequency:</th>        <td>Uncommon</td><td>Uncommon</td><td>Unique</td></tr><tr><th>Organization:</th>     <td>Court</td><td>Court</td><td>Court</td></tr><tr><th>Activity Cycle:</th>   <td>Nocturnal</td><td>Nocturnal</td><td>Nocturnal</td></tr><tr><th>Diet:</th>             <td>Any food but milk</td><td>Nil</td><td>Any food but milk</td></tr><tr><th>Intelligence:</th>     <td>Very to high (11-14)</td><td>Average (8-10)</td><td>Exceptional (16)</td></tr><tr><th>Treasure:</th>         <td>U (G)</td><td>Nil</td><td>Special</td></tr><tr><th>Alignment:</th>        <td>Any evil</td><td>Chaotic evil</td><td>Neutral Evil</td></tr><tr><th>No. Appearing:</th>    <td>1-8 (100-400)</td><td>4-16 (100-600)</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><th>Armor Class:</th>      <td>5</td><td>0</td><td>3</td></tr><tr><th>Movement:</th>         <td>12, some Fl 15 (B)</td><td>15, Fl 24 (B)</td><td>15, Fl (B)</td></tr><tr><th>Hit Dice:</th>         <td>4+2</td><td>7+2</td><td>14</td></tr><tr><th>THAC0:</th>            <td>17</td><td>13</td><td>7</td></tr><tr><th>No. of Attacks:</th>   <td>1</td><td>1</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><th>Damage/Attack:</th>    <td>1d6+1 or by spell</td><td>1d8</td><td>by spell</td></tr><tr><th>Special Attacks:</th>  <td>Spells, Seeming</td><td>Perception drain, Seeming</td><td>Seeming, spells</td></tr><tr><th>Special Defenses:</th> <td>Invisibility, Seeming, immune to charms/illusions</td><td>Iron or +1 or better weapons to hit</td><td>Immune to illusions and charm spells, invisible at will, <i>know alignment</i></td></tr><tr><th>Magic Resistance:</th> <td>25%</td><td>25%</td><td>50%</td></tr><tr><th>Size:</th>             <td>Tiny to large (6\" to 12' tall)</td><td>Tiny to large (6\" to 12' tall)</td><td>M (4' 4\" tall)</td></tr><tr><th>Morale:</th>           <td>Steady (11-12)</td><td>Elite (13-14)</td><td>16 (champion)</td></tr><tr><th>XP Value:</th>         <td>2,000</td><td>3,000</td><td>15,000</td></tr></table><p class=\"f\"><i>Lussina, they called her. The Dark Queen. She held my spirit in terror and my son in thrall. Yet the more I think about her in the years since my near-death at her hands, the more she reminds me of a rebellious adolescent in an eternal temperamental snit. Albeit a dangerous, deadly adolescent.</i></p><p><i>—Faylene, 1421 HC</i></p><br><p class=\"f\">Unseelie faeries are a macabre host of evil and undead beings, the hideous counterpart of the Seelie Court. The Unseelie Court has its own dark queen and other “nobles” who manipulate the Seeming to ward their own sinister ends.</p><p>The Unseelie Court comprises two types of faeries: evil living faeries, and evil undead faeries. Like the seelie faeries, each is unique in size, shape, and form.</p><p>The evil that the living faeries carry within has corrupted their physical appearances. Their skin bears ashen tones, their eyes are sunken or blaze with the fever of malevolence, their bodies are withered or bloated. If an evil faerie has horns, they are twisted, if it has wings, they are leathery, if it has a tail, the appendage is barbed. Unseelie faeries are far more likely than seelie faeries to sport cloven feet or taloned hands.</p><p>Undead faeries are incorporeal phantasms of their former selves. Their eyes have no pupils—only blank, white-hot glowing orbs that seethe hatred.</p><p>Unseelie faeries are even more likely than their seelie counterparts to torment travelers just for kicks. Their tricks range from merely mean-spirited to seriously harmful or even deadly—particularly if the unseelie faeries believe their victims to be allies of the Seelie Court or otherwise agents of good. PCs may not even realize the source of the attacks.</p><p>The Unseelie Court wages an age-old war against the Faerie Queen and the Seelie Court. Characters may find themselves caught in the crossfire, enlisted (willingly or not) to aid one side, or trying to redirect the war efforts toward subduing a larger menace: the Cold Rider (assuming that shadowy presence doesn't win over the Dark Queen first).</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Combat:</b> Unlike their counterparts in the Seelie Court, unseelie faeries harbor no reservations about engaging in hand-to-hand combat. Peaceful encounters are rare.</p><p>Unseelie faeries always try to use their ability to turn invisible to gain the advantage of surprise. Once discovered by an opponent, their strategies vary.</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Living evil faeries</b> use their spells until they reach melee range. They can cast five of the following spells per day: any 1st- or 2nd-level spell from the charm sphere, <i>destroy (create) water, entangle, faerie fire, protection from good (evil), putrify (purify) food and drink, shillelagh; badberry (goodberry), barkskin, obscurement, produce flame, speak with animals, warp wood; bestow (remove) curse, pyrotechnics, spike growth</i>. In addition, they can <i>cast seelie spell of forgetting</i> an unlimited number of times. </p><p>In melee, they fight with magical (<i>+1</i>) short swords individually scaled to each faerie's size and carrying an enchantment that works only when borne by a faerie. If fighting nonfaeries, they also use their Seeming abilities, both offensively and defensively (see the “<a href=\"/appendix/faerseel\">Faerie, Seelie</a>” description).</p><p>Living unseelie faeries are immune to <i>charms</i> and illusions, but have several weaknesses. Iron weapons inflict an additional 3 points of damage per hit. Salt renders them unable to turn invisible for 1d4 turns.</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Undead faeries</b>  close to melee range as quickly as possible. The touch of such a creature chills the blood and clouds the mind. For each successful hit, victims suffer 1d8 points of damage and lose 5 points from their perception score. </p><p>Undead faeries can be hit only with iron or +1 or better weapons. They are vulnerable to holy water, which inflicts 1d6+1 damage points per vial. They can be turned as spectres. </p><p>Evil doesn't fight fair. Even in what seems to have been a “peaceful” encounter with an unseelie faerie, travelers often walk away victims of a curse.</p><p>Unseelie faeries are matched only by their seelie counterparts in command of the Seeming and ability to see through it. Against nonfaerie opponents, they use it constantly to bewilder and intimidate their foes. Against the Seelie Court, however, they know such illusions are useless</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Habitat/Society:</b> The Unseelie Court is a hideous mockery of the Seelie Court—in a sense, the Faerie Queen's entourage as seen through a fun-house mirror. The Dark Queen (see below) and her followers reside in the Shadow World's most haunted, twisted forest. There, they plot against the seelie faeries and others they consider their enemies. Because evil seeks its own reflection and treachery breeds mistrust, the unseelie faeries see an enemy in nearly everyone they encounter.</p><p class=f><b>The Dark Queen</b></p><p class=\"ni\">The Dark Queen, Lussina, reigns over the Unseelie Court. The daughter of the seelie Faerie Queen, she once possessed beauty beyond imagining. But Lussina also possessed envy, ambition, and ruthlessness. She plotted to overthrow her mother and take her place as queen of the Seelie Court. She failed. The Faerie Queen, unable to bring herself to punish her daughter with a traitor's death, cast Lussina out of the Seelie Court forever. In a rage, Lussina gathered her followers together and formed her own court— with herself as queen. </p><p class=\"f\"><b>Lussina, the Dark Queen:</b>  AC 3; MV 15, Fl 15 (B); HD 14; hp 81; THAC0 7; #AT 1; Dmg by spell; SA Seeming, spells; SD immune to illusions and charm spells, <i>invisible</i> at will, <i>know alignment</i>; SW iron, salt; MR 50%; SZ M (4' 4\" tall); ML 16 (champion);  AL NE;  XP 15,000.</p><p>Notes: The queen has a Seeming score of 78 and a perception score of 90. SW— Iron weapons inflict an additional 2 points of damage with each hit; salt thrown on the queen neutralizes her invisibility ability for 1 turn; holy water burns her flesh for 1d6+1 points of damage.</p><p>S 11, D 17, C 17, I 16, W 13, Ch 19.</p><p><i>Personality</i>: Cruel, calculating, seductive, megalomanical.</p><p>Spells under her command (6/6/6/5/3/2/1 per day): All priestly spells of the charm and necromantic spheres, plus <i>destroy (create) water, detect good (evil), detect magic, entangle, faerie fire, protection from good (evil), putrify (purify) food and drink, shillelagh; badberry (goodberry), barkskin, obscurement, produce flame, speak with animals, undetectable (detect) charm, warp wood; bestow (remove) curse, create food and water, pyrotechnics, seelie spell of forgetting, spike growth, tree; hallucinatory forest, protection from good (evil) 10-foot radius, reflecting pool, sticks to snakes, tongues; false (true) seeing.</i> </p><p class=\"f\">The Dark Queen has lost her comeliness but retains the allure of a black widow. Any male character who beholds her must immediately succeed at a saving throw vs. spell or fall prey to her seduction (per a <i>charm</i> spell). Lussina seeks not to seduce her victims sexually, however, but psychologically, trying to enlist them in her side of the eternal war she wages on the Seelie Court. </p><p>Lussina demands (and receives) absolute loyalty from her followers. She grants no clemency for the smallest of infractions; even harmless negligence is punishable by death. Her own life, she believes, demonstrates the folly of mercy—she considers her mother a fool for having spared it. The Dark Queen will not risk another traitor rising up to depose <i>her</i>. </p><p>The Unseelie Court continually receives new members. The Faerie Queen has no tolerance for faeries with evil tendencies—more often than not, the malevolent faeries she banishes from her court find their way to her daughter's.</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Ecology:</b> Undead members of the Unseelie Court come into being when a faerie (of any alignment) dies in a battle between the two courts. The horror of kin slaying kin creates a ripple through the Seeming itself, preventing the deceased faerie from dissipating into it. The creature's spirit becomes trapped, sentenced to eternally walk the Shadow World but stripped of the magical abilities it once had. It becomes an unthinking being, lashing out in anger and resentment at the living, held in check only by the Dark Queen. </p><p><a href=\"/appendix/gremlin\">Gremlins</a> and <a href=\"/appendix/imp\">imps</a> (see the MONSTROUS MANUAL accessory) have been spotted among the Unseelie Court</p>\n","images":["<img src=\"grf/br.gif\" width=\"150\" height=\"75\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Birthright\" title=\"Birthright\" align=\"right\">","<img src=\"grf/tsr_sm.png\" width=\"56\" height=\"59\" border=\"0\" alt=\"TSR\">"],"setting":"Birthright","statblock":{"Living Evil Faerie":{"Activity Cycle":"Nocturnal","Alignment":"Any evil","Armor Class":"5","Climate/Terrain":"Shadow World","Damage/Attack":"1d6+1 or by spell","Diet":"Any food but milk","Frequency":"Uncommon","Hit Dice":"4+2","Intelligence":"Very to high (11-14)","Magic Resistance":"25%","Morale":"Steady (11-12)","Movement":"12, some Fl 15 (B)","No. Appearing":"1-8 (100-400)","No. of Attacks":"1","Organization":"Court","Size":"Tiny to large (6\" to 12' tall)","Special Attacks":"Spells, Seeming","Special Defenses":"Invisibility, Seeming, immune to charms/illusions","THAC0":"17","Treasure":"U (G)","XP Value":"2,000"},"Lussina, the Dark Queen":{"Activity Cycle":"Nocturnal","Alignment":"Neutral Evil","Armor Class":"3","Climate/Terrain":"Shadow World","Damage/Attack":"by spell","Diet":"Any food but milk","Frequency":"Unique","Hit Dice":"14","Intelligence":"Exceptional (16)","Magic Resistance":"50%","Morale":"16 (champion)","Movement":"15, Fl (B)","No. Appearing":"1","No. of Attacks":"1","Organization":"Court","Size":"M (4' 4\" tall)","Special Attacks":"Seeming, spells","Special Defenses":"Immune to illusions and charm spells, invisible at will, <i>know alignment</i>","THAC0":"7","Treasure":"Special","XP Value":"15,000"},"Undead Faerie":{"Activity Cycle":"Nocturnal","Alignment":"Chaotic evil","Armor Class":"0","Climate/Terrain":"Shadow World","Damage/Attack":"1d8","Diet":"Nil","Frequency":"Uncommon","Hit Dice":"7+2","Intelligence":"Average (8-10)","Magic Resistance":"25%","Morale":"Elite (13-14)","Movement":"15, Fl 24 (B)","No. Appearing":"4-16 (100-600)","No. of Attacks":"1","Organization":"Court","Size":"Tiny to large (6\" to 12' tall)","Special Attacks":"Perception drain, Seeming","Special Defenses":"Iron or +1 or better weapons to hit","THAC0":"13","Treasure":"Nil","XP Value":"3,000"}},"title":"Faerie, Unseelie"},"sources":["3140"],"statblock_names":[],"title":"Faerie, Unseelie","prev_key":"faerseel","next_key":"fainil","monster_path":"/appendix/faerunse"}},"staticQueryHashes":[],"slicesMap":{}}
