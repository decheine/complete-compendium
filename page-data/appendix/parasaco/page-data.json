While the powers listed above are the most common, some aarakocra have different or additional powers.</p><p class=\"f\">A race of intelligent, birdlike creatures living in the deepest deserts of Athas, the rare Athasian <a href=\"/appendix/aarakocr\">aarakocra</a> spends its time soaring on thermals in search of food.</p><p>The aarakocra is 7 to 8 feet tall with a wingspan of 20 feet or more. Because of its large wingspan, an aarakocra can carry as much as 75% of its own body weight and still fly easily. An aarakocra can fly a short distance carrying a burden equaling 125% of its own body weight. The average body weight of a full grown male is 100 pounds and a female is 85 pounds.</p><p>Each wing has a &ldquo;hand&rdquo; at its midpoint, consisting of three fingers and an opposable thumb. The fourth finger forms the rigid leading edge of the wing. In flight the hands cannot be used, but on the ground the aarakocra can use its hands almost as a human would. The aarakocra's body is protected by a thin bony plate on the chest, much like a solid rib cage. Talons on its legs can be used as claws and can be retracted to reveal a second set of hands, also with three fingers and an opposable thumb. Except for the chest plate, the entire skeleton is hollow and extremely fragile.</p><p>From a distance, the Athasian aarakocra resembles a huge <a href=\"/appendix/bird\">vulture</a>. Its black eyes, set in the front of the head, provide excellent vision over a long range. The plumage is generally black with a white collar for adult males and black or brown with a smaller white collar for females. Adolescents are a mixture of brown and black. The beak is large and covers most of the head. Plumage begins at the crown of the head and is darker near the head, except for the collar. Athasian aarakocra speak their own language and the languages of vultures and other large birds. Some speak the common tongue (5% to 10% chance depending on how deep in the wastelands a tribe lives).</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Combat:</b> Aarakocra can fight in the air or on the ground. They prefer aerial combat since their bones are too fragile to withstand a solid blow from a human-sized opponent. In combat against creatures on the ground, they prefer to fly over their victim and drop weighted nets. Some aarakocra use darts to harass ground-based opponents.</p><p>If their opponents can fly, the aarakocra generally forgo the use of the net, although large groups sometimes use nets on flying creatures. Normally, aarakocra attack flying creatures with long spears, diving from above and allowing the momentum to carry the spear through the target. Such an attack doubles the damage if the aarakocra have been able to dive at least 50 feet. Only the very largest aarakocra can carry more than one of these spears, they can attack with both at once with no penalty, causing double damage on each strike. All diving attacks are made at +4 and should be treated as a charge attack. All other penalties and restrictions of charge attacks apply.</p><p>The effect of the aarakocra's nets depends on if the opponent is flying at the time it becomes entangled. Creatures on the ground that are hit by a net are entangled and unable to participate in any combat until they make a successful Strength check to get free of the net. Flying creatures hit by a net can no longer fly and immediately begin falling. If they cannot escape the net or use some magical means to arrest the fall, normal falling damage applies.</p><p>Unless victims are entangled in nets, aarakocra are cautious in ground combat. If the aarakocra outnumber their opponents they advance in a straight line and thrust with their spears. If outnumbered, or the opponents are particularly tough, the aarakocra withdraw. Victims entangled in nets are killed or incapacitated for use as food or ransom.</p><p>Athasian aarakocra are mindful of their physical limitations as well as their comparatively low psionic abilities. They do not normally initiate psionic combat. At the first sign of psionic powers from any of their victims, however, all aarakocra that have some ability will use whatever attack and defense modes they can in an attempt to destroy the threat. Large groups of is or more aarakocra may initiate psionic combat if their leaders feel they can win quickly and avoid physical combat.</p><p>In desperation, an aarakocra can attempt to bite an opponent in combat. Because of the unwieldiness of its beak, the aarakocra has a THAC0 of 18 if attacking with this appendage. Further, the birdman causes only 1d2 points of damage with the beak.</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Habitat/Society:</b> Athasian aarakocra live in tribes with 6-20 (2d8+4) members, depending on the prestige of the leader. The largest tribe ever recorded had 50 members. The tribal hunting territory depends on the size of the tribe, usually about 500 square miles for a tribe of 10 members. There are no rigid boundaries between tribes and border disputes are not uncommon.</p><p>Alignments of tribe members are similar to the alignment of the leader. A tribe that has a leader who is neutral good may have neutral good, chaotic good, lawful good, and true neutral members. A predominantly evil tribe does not recognize boundaries with other tribes and treats other tribes as inferior beings to be eliminated.</p><p>Athasian aarakocra aren't happy in enclosed spaces, but they they take refuge in a cave or building if necessary.</p><p>Nonevil tribes live in rocky aeries in the highest peaks they can find. Evil tribes are normally nomadic and use an aerie made by another tribe if they need to remain in an area for a long time, even if they have to evict the tribe that made the nest.</p><p>Aarakocra aren't friendly toward intruders in their territory, especially caravans. They try to extract a toll from the caravan for passage through the desert. Good-aligned tribes allow unhindered passage of caravans that pay a tribute. If someone refuses to pay the tribute, the aarakocra try to capture scouts or outriders from the party and hold them until an even larger tribute is paid. The payment may be either livestock or shiny objects. Aarakocra are smart enough not to be taken in by glass baubles instead of gems, although they cannot tell the difference between the more common gems and the rare ones.</p><p>Evil tribes ask for tribute and often attack a caravan whether it pays or not. Aarakocra always demand shiny objects such as stones. These tribes find humans and demihumans to be quite tasty and prefer them to other food.</p><p>Good-aligned tribes of aarakocra sometimes return a lost traveler to the edge of the desert after first removing any valuables the traveler may be carrying. On very rare occasions a tribe might return a lost group of travelers to the more frequently traveled parts of the desert, again after first taking any valuables as payment.</p><p>The oldest male is the leader of the tribal hunting party and has 4+4 Hit Dice. The oldest female is in charge of the tribal aerie and has 3+3 HD. In tribes that have more than 15 members, the next oldest aarakocra serves as shaman and has 3+3 HD; the shaman completes the triumvirate necessary for proper worship and the summoning of elementals. (Interestingly, no magic-using aarakocra has ever been recorded.) Tribes without a shaman cannot summon <a href=\"/appendix/element1\">air elementals</a>, which is an important part of aarakocra culture.</p><p>The shaman is the leader of the daily sun worship. Aarakocra worship the sun because it provides them with the thermals they need to soar in search of food. The shaman also leads the mystic rituals used to summon an air elemental. Summoning an air elemental is usually done only in preparation for the tribe's most sacred ceremony, the hunt. Small tribes must band together for this ceremony to allow the triumvirate to be formed.</p><p>The ceremony to summon an air elemental must be conducted at dawn and requires the oldest male and female to emit a highpitched keening whistle. The shaman conducts an intricate dance around them, simultaneously chanting an ancient summoning mantra.</p><p>The hunt is the final part of the initiation of adolescent aarakocra to adulthood and often takes the tribe far from their normal teritory. The target is always a <a href=\"/appendix/drakalsi\">silt drake</a>. The hunt is the only time the females leave the relative safety of the nest. Even an evil tribe will not interfere with a tribe on a hunt. An air elemental is often summoned to help find the drake, but never takes part in the actual combat. Although the adult members of the tribe take part in the initial phases of the combat, it is the initiates who deliver the final, killing blows to me drake. Scars from the hunt are considered a mark of pride among all aarakocra.</p><p>The females spend about eight months of the year incubating their eggs. Athasian aarakocra mate for life and a pair normally produces as many as 10 offspring. A female lays one egg a year. Constant incubation is not required because of the high daytime temperatures, so the females can maintain the nest and keep the tribe's treasure in order.</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Ecology:</b> Athasian aarakocra are high on the food chain and have no natural enemies other than <a href=\"/appendix/drakatha\">drakes</a>. Unless evil, aarakocra leave their own territory only to hunt the silt drake and return as soon as possible when the hunt is over. (Evil aarakocra attack others, as noted above.) Aarakocra eggs and hatchlings are sought after by wealthy land owners who wish to use the creatures as scouts and sentries. An egg can bring as much as 10 cp in Tyr's marketplace. Tribes that have had eggs or hatchlings stolen have long memories and sometimes take revenge against the thief at a later date. Captive aarakocra join any tribe they come in contact with.</p><p>Athasian aarakocra have a natural life span of 21-30 years.</p><p></p><br clear=\"all\" style=\"clear:both; height:0;\">\r\n","images":["<img src=\"grf/ds.gif\" width=\"150\" height=\"75\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Dark Sun\" title=\"Dark Sun\" align=\"right\">","<img src=\"img/aarakath.gif\" alt=\"Aarakocra (Athas)\" title=\"Aarakocra (Athas)\" border=\"0\" width=\"300\" height=\"360\" style=\"text-align:right;\" align=\"right\">","<img src=\"grf/add2_01.gif\" width=\"200\" height=\"56\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Advanced Dungeons & Dragons 2nd Edition\">"],"setting":"Dark Sun","statblock":{"Aarakocra (Athas)":{"Activity Cycle":"Day","Alignment":"Any","Armor Class":"7","Climate/Terrain":"Deep desert","Damage/Attack":"1d3/1d3 or by weapon","Diet":"Carnivore","Frequency":"Rare","Hit Dice":"2+2","Intelligence":"Average (8-10)","Magic Resistance":"Nil","Morale":"Steady (11)","Movement":"6, Fl 36 (C)","No. Appearing":"1d10","No. of Attacks":"2","Organization":"Tribal","Size":"M (20'+ wingspan)","Special Attacks":"Nil","Special Defenses":"Nil","THAC0":"17","Treasure":"Varies","XP Value":"65"}},"title":"Aarakocra (Athas)"},"sources":["2433"],"statblock_names":[],"title":"Aarakocra (Athas)","prev_key":"zygraat","next_key":"aarakocr","monster_path":"/appendix/aarakath"}}},"pageContext":{"monster_key":"parasaco","monster_data":{"TSR":["2524"],"fullBody":"  <table cellspacing=\"0\" cellpadding=\"0\"><tr><th>Climate/Terrain:</th><td>Any</td></tr><tr><th>Frequency:</th><td>Rare</td></tr><tr><th>Organization:</th><td>Nil</td></tr><tr><th>Activity Cycle:</th><td>Any</td></tr><tr><th>Diet:</th><td>Special</td></tr><tr><th>Intelligence:</th><td>Non- (0)</td></tr><tr><th>Treasure:</th><td>Nil</td></tr><tr><th>Alignment:</th><td>Nil</td></tr><tr><th>No. Appearing:</th><td>1 infestation</td></tr><tr><th>Armor Class:</th><td>Nil</td></tr><tr><th>Movement:</th><td>Nil</td></tr><tr><th>Hit Dice:</th><td>Nil</td></tr><tr><th>THAC0:</th><td>Nil</td></tr><tr><th>No. of Attacks:</th><td>Variable</td></tr><tr><th>Damage/Attack:</th><td>Variable</td></tr><tr><th>Special Attacks:</th><td>Variable</td></tr><tr><th>Special Defenses:</th><td>Variable</td></tr><tr><th>Magic Resistance:</th><td>Nil</td></tr><tr><th>Size:</th><td>T (less than 1' long)</td></tr><tr><th>Morale:</th><td>Nil</td></tr><tr><th>XP Value:</th><td>15 if nonfatal<br>65 if potentially fatal</td></tr></table><p class=\"f\"><b>Combat:</b> <a href=\"/appendix/parasite\">Parasites</a> do not inflict combat damage. Each parasite has a special attack mode, outlined below. A victim who survives infestation by one of these parasites should receive the experience point award. Some parasites are deadly, in which case the victim receives a larger experience point award. Other parasites are merely annoying or inconvenient, so the experience point award is less. In many cases, the majority of the experience points from an encounter with a parasite will come from the subsequent adventures that take place while the victim is seeking a cure.</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Habitat/Society:</b> Parasites are mindless and have no organized society. Most parasites are extremely adaptable and can live wherever their hosts can live.</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Ecology:</b> Parasites derive all or part of their nutrients from the host, usually without contributing anything helpful.</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Louse, Inheritor</b></p>  <p class=\"ni\">These tiny parasites resemble common head lice, usually inhabiting the hair or fur of the host creature. They cause their victims to deplete <i>cinnabryl</i> more quickly; the level of increase depends on how badly the carrier is infested. (Roll percentile dice to determine the degree of infestation.) A victim with a 50% infestation depletes <i>cinnabryl</i> at an increase of half the normal rate. A 100% infestation would cause the victim to deplete <i>cinnabryl</i> at twice the normal rate.</p><p>Collectively, Inheritor lice can also indiscriminately teleport the carrier (as per the Displace Legacy) up to three times per day. This usually happens if the host is physically threatened or in danger, but can also happen at completely random (and sometimes embarrassing) moments. The Inheritor lice thus attempt to preserve the life of their hosts.</p><p>Purging a humanoid body of Inheritor lice requires expensive ointments made with <i>cinnabryl</i> powder. <a href=\"/appendix/lyrabird\">Saragón lyra birds</a> prey upon these lice.</p><p></p><p class=\"f\"><b>Moth, Powder</b></p>  <p class=\"ni\">These tiny insects swarm together and build breeding-nests inside caches of <i>smokepowder</i>. They consume the <i>vermeil</i> contained in the <i>smokepowder</i>, quickly spoiling it. The moths are so small that they cannot be seen unless a <i>detect invisibility</i> is used. After the mating season is over, the insects leave the spoiled powder.</p><p>The insects cause chemical reactions in the <i>smokepowder</i>, which could cause any remaining unspoiled powder to detonate if the container is moved while the moths are still inside. (Roll percentile dice to determine the amount of spoiled powder.) Any person moving a powder-moth-infested keg must make a successful saving throw vs. paralyzation, or the keg will detonate.</p><p>A full keg of <i>smokepowder</i>, if detonated, would inflict 10d6+10 points of damage to everyone within a 10-foot radius, half that out to a 20-foot radius. A successful saving throw vs. breath weapon reduces this to half damage. Also, the damage should be adjusted according to the amount of powder remaining in the keg. A keg that is 50% spoiled would do (10d6+10)&times;½ points of damage. This detonation depletes <i>cinnabryl</i> worn by any Inheritors within the 20-foot radius, at a rate of one week's worth for every 8 points of damage inflicted. An explosion that did 22 points of damage would thus deplete two weeks worth of <i>cinnabryl</i>.</p><p></p><p class=\"f\"><b>Pest, Jibar�</b></p>  <p class=\"ni\">The Jibar� jungle abounds with thousands of species of deadly and annoying parasites and insects. Jibar� pests are always either poisonous or equipped with a potentially deadly defense mechanism. The <a href=\"/appendix/phanaton\">phanatons</a> know how to avoid or neutralize most of these pests.</p><p>Nearly all Jibar� pests provide some component useful in the preparation of medicines, poisons, and antidotes; some, if prepared correctly, even have the potential to counter Afflictions or other infestations like Inheritor lice, cardinal ticks, and vermilia. Jibar� pests are intended to be more of an adventure hook than true monsters. Possible Jibar� pests include:</p><p>#l A small moth that spreads an hallucinogenic powder which makes its victims truly believe that they can fly. The moth can also be used to prepare a medicine that alleviates detriments associated with the Fly Legacy.|A small brown leech that drains several hit points worth of blood each week but prevents Afflictions associated with the Strength Legacy.|A bright green, fiercely territorial, poisonous wasp (if stung, make a successful saving throw vs. poison or die). The wasp's nest can be processed and made into an ointment that will cure those infected with vermilia.</p><p></p><p class=\"f\"><b>Plague, Lupin</b></p>  <p class=\"ni\">The lupin plague is an extremely deadly infestation of disgusting burgundy, purple, or ginger-colored maggots. These creatures are usually attracted to maturing grapes, in which they lay tiny eggs. The eggs survive the fermentation of the grapes, hatching months later in the wine. Even worse, the eggs survive if they are ingested by someone unfortunate enough to consume tainted wine or grapes. Once hatched, these maggots grow quickly and eat their host from the inside unless proper medication or magical healing is used. The victim must make a successful saving throw vs. poison with a -3 penalty at the end of each day or die. More than one unscrupulous assassin has used wine tainted with the lupin plague to kill a victim.</p><p>These pests were dubbed the lupin plague because Renardy (the home of the <a href=\"/appendix/lupin\">lupins</a>) is the main producer of wine (and thus grapes) on the Savage Coast. However, new strains could feasibly spread to other vegetables, like hops, potatoes, grain, rice, or scarlet pimpernels.</p><p></p><p class=\"f\"><b>Tick, Cardinal</b></p>  <p class=\"ni\">These tiny parasites usually infest humanoids with Legacies, although they can survive on blood alone. The presence of cardinal ticks reduces or deprives the host's Legacy powers, but it does not alter the other effects of the Red Curse upon them. Roll percentile dice to determine the level of infestation and thus the host's chance of failure when attempting to use a Legacy.</p><p>A single melee encounter against a tick-bearing creature causes everyone involved to walk away with a 5% infestation. Ticks then multiply at a rate of 15% each time the host attempts to use a Legacy. Nonhumanoids are naturally limited to a maximum 50% infestation.</p><p>Purging someone of a cardinal tick infestation requires expensive ointments made with <i>cinnabryl</i> powder. Scratching off the ticks causes 1 point of damage per 1% removed, unless rare Jibar� medicine can be used (see Jibar� pest). These ticks can often be found on <a href=\"/appendix/voat\">voats</a>, <a href=\"/appendix/succulus\">succuli</a>, <a href=\"/appendix/voathera\">Slagovich juggernauts</a>, <a href=\"/appendix/trollega\">legacy trolls</a>, <a href=\"/appendix/cinnavix\">cinnavixens</a>, and <a href=\"/appendix/batracin\">batracines</a>. Saragón lyra birds often prey on cardinal ticks.</p><p></p><p class=\"f\"><b>Vermilia</b></p>  <p class=\"ni\">Vermilia are red, glowing bacteria which are often mistaken for <i>vermeil</i>. Unlike the harmless <i>vermeil</i>, however, vermilia are flesh-eating bacteria. They are sometimes found on the decaying bodies of dead, Legacy-using creatures, along with vermeil fungus and scarlet pimpernels.</p><p>Vermilia infection causes 1 point of damage the first day, 2 the second, 4 the third, 8 the fourth, etc., until either a <i>cure disease</i> or a <i>heal</i> spell is applied to the victim. Vermilia counts as a +2 magical weapon for purposes of devouring undead or magical creatures.</p><p>The blood of <a href=\"/appendix/vulthoun\">vulturehounds</a> and various Jibar� pests can be used in the preparation of medicine useful for killing vermilia. Fire effectively cleanses all vermilia-infested remains.</p><p>Vermilia is transmitted through physical contact only. Living creatures must make successful saving throws vs. poison to avoid the infection. Undead creatures are automatically infected, but they can attempt a saving throw vs. death magic at the end of each day, with a penalty equal to the damage caused by the vermilia. If the saving throw is successful, the undead creature takes no damage that day. All Legacy-using creatures get a -1 penalty per Legacy to any saving throws associated with vermilia infection.</p><p></p><br clear=\"all\" style=\"clear:both; height:0;\">\r\n","images":["<img src=\"grf/rs.gif\" width=\"150\" height=\"75\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Red Steel (Mystara)\" title=\"Red Steel (Mystara)\" align=\"right\">","<img src=\"img/parasaco.gif\" alt=\"Jibar� Pest (Parasite, Savage Coast)\" title=\"Jibar� Pest (Parasite, Savage Coast)\" border=\"0\" width=\"300\" height=\"360\" style=\"text-align:right;\" align=\"right\">","<img src=\"grf/add2_01.gif\" width=\"200\" height=\"56\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Advanced Dungeons & Dragons 2nd Edition\">"],"setting":"Red Steel (Mystara)","statblock":{"Parasite (Savage Coast)":{"Activity Cycle":"Any","Alignment":"Nil","Armor Class":"Nil","Climate/Terrain":"Any","Damage/Attack":"Variable","Diet":"Special","Frequency":"Rare","Hit Dice":"Nil","Intelligence":"Non- (0)","Magic Resistance":"Nil","Morale":"Nil","Movement":"Nil","No. Appearing":"1 infestation","No. of Attacks":"Variable","Organization":"Nil","Size":"T (less than 1' long)","Special Attacks":"Variable","Special Defenses":"Variable","THAC0":"Nil","Treasure":"Nil","XP Value":"15 if nonfatal<br>65 if potentially fatal"}},"title":"Parasite (Savage Coast)"},"sources":["2524"],"statblock_names":[],"title":"Parasite (Savage Coast)","prev_key":"parai","next_key":"parasite","monster_path":"/appendix/parasaco"}},"staticQueryHashes":[],"slicesMap":{}}
