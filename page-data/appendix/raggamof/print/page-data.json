While the powers listed above are the most common, some aarakocra have different or additional powers.</p><p class=\"f\">A race of intelligent, birdlike creatures living in the deepest deserts of Athas, the rare Athasian <a href=\"/appendix/aarakocr\">aarakocra</a> spends its time soaring on thermals in search of food.</p><p>The aarakocra is 7 to 8 feet tall with a wingspan of 20 feet or more. Because of its large wingspan, an aarakocra can carry as much as 75% of its own body weight and still fly easily. An aarakocra can fly a short distance carrying a burden equaling 125% of its own body weight. The average body weight of a full grown male is 100 pounds and a female is 85 pounds.</p><p>Each wing has a &ldquo;hand&rdquo; at its midpoint, consisting of three fingers and an opposable thumb. The fourth finger forms the rigid leading edge of the wing. In flight the hands cannot be used, but on the ground the aarakocra can use its hands almost as a human would. The aarakocra's body is protected by a thin bony plate on the chest, much like a solid rib cage. Talons on its legs can be used as claws and can be retracted to reveal a second set of hands, also with three fingers and an opposable thumb. Except for the chest plate, the entire skeleton is hollow and extremely fragile.</p><p>From a distance, the Athasian aarakocra resembles a huge <a href=\"/appendix/bird\">vulture</a>. Its black eyes, set in the front of the head, provide excellent vision over a long range. The plumage is generally black with a white collar for adult males and black or brown with a smaller white collar for females. Adolescents are a mixture of brown and black. The beak is large and covers most of the head. Plumage begins at the crown of the head and is darker near the head, except for the collar. Athasian aarakocra speak their own language and the languages of vultures and other large birds. Some speak the common tongue (5% to 10% chance depending on how deep in the wastelands a tribe lives).</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Combat:</b> Aarakocra can fight in the air or on the ground. They prefer aerial combat since their bones are too fragile to withstand a solid blow from a human-sized opponent. In combat against creatures on the ground, they prefer to fly over their victim and drop weighted nets. Some aarakocra use darts to harass ground-based opponents.</p><p>If their opponents can fly, the aarakocra generally forgo the use of the net, although large groups sometimes use nets on flying creatures. Normally, aarakocra attack flying creatures with long spears, diving from above and allowing the momentum to carry the spear through the target. Such an attack doubles the damage if the aarakocra have been able to dive at least 50 feet. Only the very largest aarakocra can carry more than one of these spears, they can attack with both at once with no penalty, causing double damage on each strike. All diving attacks are made at +4 and should be treated as a charge attack. All other penalties and restrictions of charge attacks apply.</p><p>The effect of the aarakocra's nets depends on if the opponent is flying at the time it becomes entangled. Creatures on the ground that are hit by a net are entangled and unable to participate in any combat until they make a successful Strength check to get free of the net. Flying creatures hit by a net can no longer fly and immediately begin falling. If they cannot escape the net or use some magical means to arrest the fall, normal falling damage applies.</p><p>Unless victims are entangled in nets, aarakocra are cautious in ground combat. If the aarakocra outnumber their opponents they advance in a straight line and thrust with their spears. If outnumbered, or the opponents are particularly tough, the aarakocra withdraw. Victims entangled in nets are killed or incapacitated for use as food or ransom.</p><p>Athasian aarakocra are mindful of their physical limitations as well as their comparatively low psionic abilities. They do not normally initiate psionic combat. At the first sign of psionic powers from any of their victims, however, all aarakocra that have some ability will use whatever attack and defense modes they can in an attempt to destroy the threat. Large groups of is or more aarakocra may initiate psionic combat if their leaders feel they can win quickly and avoid physical combat.</p><p>In desperation, an aarakocra can attempt to bite an opponent in combat. Because of the unwieldiness of its beak, the aarakocra has a THAC0 of 18 if attacking with this appendage. Further, the birdman causes only 1d2 points of damage with the beak.</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Habitat/Society:</b> Athasian aarakocra live in tribes with 6-20 (2d8+4) members, depending on the prestige of the leader. The largest tribe ever recorded had 50 members. The tribal hunting territory depends on the size of the tribe, usually about 500 square miles for a tribe of 10 members. There are no rigid boundaries between tribes and border disputes are not uncommon.</p><p>Alignments of tribe members are similar to the alignment of the leader. A tribe that has a leader who is neutral good may have neutral good, chaotic good, lawful good, and true neutral members. A predominantly evil tribe does not recognize boundaries with other tribes and treats other tribes as inferior beings to be eliminated.</p><p>Athasian aarakocra aren't happy in enclosed spaces, but they they take refuge in a cave or building if necessary.</p><p>Nonevil tribes live in rocky aeries in the highest peaks they can find. Evil tribes are normally nomadic and use an aerie made by another tribe if they need to remain in an area for a long time, even if they have to evict the tribe that made the nest.</p><p>Aarakocra aren't friendly toward intruders in their territory, especially caravans. They try to extract a toll from the caravan for passage through the desert. Good-aligned tribes allow unhindered passage of caravans that pay a tribute. If someone refuses to pay the tribute, the aarakocra try to capture scouts or outriders from the party and hold them until an even larger tribute is paid. The payment may be either livestock or shiny objects. Aarakocra are smart enough not to be taken in by glass baubles instead of gems, although they cannot tell the difference between the more common gems and the rare ones.</p><p>Evil tribes ask for tribute and often attack a caravan whether it pays or not. Aarakocra always demand shiny objects such as stones. These tribes find humans and demihumans to be quite tasty and prefer them to other food.</p><p>Good-aligned tribes of aarakocra sometimes return a lost traveler to the edge of the desert after first removing any valuables the traveler may be carrying. On very rare occasions a tribe might return a lost group of travelers to the more frequently traveled parts of the desert, again after first taking any valuables as payment.</p><p>The oldest male is the leader of the tribal hunting party and has 4+4 Hit Dice. The oldest female is in charge of the tribal aerie and has 3+3 HD. In tribes that have more than 15 members, the next oldest aarakocra serves as shaman and has 3+3 HD; the shaman completes the triumvirate necessary for proper worship and the summoning of elementals. (Interestingly, no magic-using aarakocra has ever been recorded.) Tribes without a shaman cannot summon <a href=\"/appendix/element1\">air elementals</a>, which is an important part of aarakocra culture.</p><p>The shaman is the leader of the daily sun worship. Aarakocra worship the sun because it provides them with the thermals they need to soar in search of food. The shaman also leads the mystic rituals used to summon an air elemental. Summoning an air elemental is usually done only in preparation for the tribe's most sacred ceremony, the hunt. Small tribes must band together for this ceremony to allow the triumvirate to be formed.</p><p>The ceremony to summon an air elemental must be conducted at dawn and requires the oldest male and female to emit a highpitched keening whistle. The shaman conducts an intricate dance around them, simultaneously chanting an ancient summoning mantra.</p><p>The hunt is the final part of the initiation of adolescent aarakocra to adulthood and often takes the tribe far from their normal teritory. The target is always a <a href=\"/appendix/drakalsi\">silt drake</a>. The hunt is the only time the females leave the relative safety of the nest. Even an evil tribe will not interfere with a tribe on a hunt. An air elemental is often summoned to help find the drake, but never takes part in the actual combat. Although the adult members of the tribe take part in the initial phases of the combat, it is the initiates who deliver the final, killing blows to me drake. Scars from the hunt are considered a mark of pride among all aarakocra.</p><p>The females spend about eight months of the year incubating their eggs. Athasian aarakocra mate for life and a pair normally produces as many as 10 offspring. A female lays one egg a year. Constant incubation is not required because of the high daytime temperatures, so the females can maintain the nest and keep the tribe's treasure in order.</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Ecology:</b> Athasian aarakocra are high on the food chain and have no natural enemies other than <a href=\"/appendix/drakatha\">drakes</a>. Unless evil, aarakocra leave their own territory only to hunt the silt drake and return as soon as possible when the hunt is over. (Evil aarakocra attack others, as noted above.) Aarakocra eggs and hatchlings are sought after by wealthy land owners who wish to use the creatures as scouts and sentries. An egg can bring as much as 10 cp in Tyr's marketplace. Tribes that have had eggs or hatchlings stolen have long memories and sometimes take revenge against the thief at a later date. Captive aarakocra join any tribe they come in contact with.</p><p>Athasian aarakocra have a natural life span of 21-30 years.</p><p></p><br clear=\"all\" style=\"clear:both; height:0;\">\r\n","images":["<img src=\"grf/ds.gif\" width=\"150\" height=\"75\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Dark Sun\" title=\"Dark Sun\" align=\"right\">","<img src=\"img/aarakath.gif\" alt=\"Aarakocra (Athas)\" title=\"Aarakocra (Athas)\" border=\"0\" width=\"300\" height=\"360\" style=\"text-align:right;\" align=\"right\">","<img src=\"grf/add2_01.gif\" width=\"200\" height=\"56\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Advanced Dungeons & Dragons 2nd Edition\">"],"setting":"Dark Sun","statblock":{"Aarakocra (Athas)":{"Activity Cycle":"Day","Alignment":"Any","Armor Class":"7","Climate/Terrain":"Deep desert","Damage/Attack":"1d3/1d3 or by weapon","Diet":"Carnivore","Frequency":"Rare","Hit Dice":"2+2","Intelligence":"Average (8-10)","Magic Resistance":"Nil","Morale":"Steady (11)","Movement":"6, Fl 36 (C)","No. Appearing":"1d10","No. of Attacks":"2","Organization":"Tribal","Size":"M (20'+ wingspan)","Special Attacks":"Nil","Special Defenses":"Nil","THAC0":"17","Treasure":"Varies","XP Value":"65"}},"title":"Aarakocra (Athas)"},"sources":["2433"],"statblock_names":[],"title":"Aarakocra (Athas)","prev_key":"zygraat","next_key":"aarakocr","monster_path":"/appendix/aarakath"}}},"pageContext":{"monster_key":"raggamof","monster_data":{"TSR":["1109","2158"],"fullBody":"  <table cellspacing=\"0\" cellpadding=\"0\"><tr class=\"bk\"><th> </th><th class=\"cn\">Tatterdemanimal</th><th class=\"cn\">Common Raggamoffyn</th><th class=\"cn\">Gutterspite</th><th class=\"cn\">Shrapnyl</th></tr><tr><th>Climate/Terrain:</th><td>Temperate urban</td><td>Temperate urban</td><td>Temperate urban</td><td>Temperate urban</td></tr><tr><th>Frequency:</th><td>Uncommon</td><td>Uncommon</td><td>Rare</td><td>Very Rare</td></tr><tr><th>Organization:</th><td>Hive/colony</td><td>Hive/colony</td><td>Hive/colony</td><td>Hive/colony</td></tr><tr><th>Activity Cycle:</th><td>Night</td><td>Night</td><td>Day</td><td>Any</td></tr><tr><th>Diet:</th><td>Carnivore</td><td>Carnivore</td><td>Carnivore</td><td>Carnivore</td></tr><tr><th>Intelligence:</th><td>Low (5-7)</td><td>Average (8-10)</td><td>Very (11-12)</td><td>High (13-14)</td></tr><tr><th>Treasure:</th><td>Nil</td><td>Nil (Q&times;3)</td><td>Nil (Q&times;3)</td><td>Nil (Q&times;3)</td></tr><tr><th>Alignment:</th><td>Neutral</td><td>Chaotic neutral</td><td>Neutral</td><td>Chaotic evil</td></tr><tr><th>No. Appearing:</th><td>1-6</td><td>1-4</td><td>1-3</td><td>1-2</td></tr><tr><th>Armor Class:</th><td>10</td><td>5</td><td>0</td><td>-5</td></tr><tr><th>Movement:</th><td>18, Fl 12 (E)</td><td>12, Fl 8 (E)</td><td>6, Fl 6 (E)</td><td>6, Fl 4 (E)</td></tr><tr><th>Hit Dice:</th><td>1</td><td>3</td><td>5</td><td>7</td></tr><tr><th>THAC0:</th><td>20</td><td>17</td><td>15</td><td>13</td></tr><tr><th>No. of Attacks:</th><td>1</td><td>1</td><td>1</td><td>1 or 5</td></tr><tr><th>Damage/Attack:</th><td>1d2</td><td>1d6</td><td>2d8</td><td>2d12 or 1d6 (&times;5)</td></tr><tr><th>Special Attacks:</th><td>Control host</td><td>Suffocation, control host</td><td>Blinding, control host</td><td>Control host, explode</td></tr><tr><th>Special Defenses:</th><td>Immune to blunt weapons and mind-affecting spells</td><td>Immune to mind-affecting spells</td><td>Immune to mind-affecting spells</td><td>Immune to mind-affecting spells</td></tr><tr><th>Magic Resistance:</th><td>Nil</td><td>Nil</td><td>Nil</td><td>Nil</td></tr><tr><th>Size:</th><td>S</td><td>M</td><td>M</td><td>L</td></tr><tr><th>Morale:</th><td>Unsteady (6)</td><td>Steady (11)</td><td>Elite (14)</td><td>Champion (16)</td></tr><tr><th>XP Value:</th><td>120</td><td>270</td><td>1,400</td><td>3,000</td></tr></table><p class=\"f\">These mysterious creatures are sentient scraps of cloth, leather, and metal of unknown origin. Some say that they are formed from the remnants of magical cloaks, boots, and weapons, when these are worn out and discarded. Others claim that a Rag Mage is creating these animated creatures using a cursed <i>manual of <a href=\"/appendix/golem\">golems</a></i>.</p><p>Raggamoffyns speak no known language, though they understand spoken common well enough.</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Combat:</b> Raggamoffyns all prefer to fight by possessing a host. They do this by physically wrapping up the victim, wrapping themselves around their target like cloth around a <a href=\"/appendix/mummy\">mummy</a>. To enfold a victim, the raggamoffyn must make a successful attack roll against the target's Armor Class counting only Dexterity and magical bonuses, no armor or shield bonuses. If they succeed, a raggamoffyn's cloud of scraps and tatters flows around the target and covers the victim in a skin-tight sheath from head to toe, including covering the eyes and ears. Most raggamoffyns also create a sort of hood or cowl over their host's head, to make it appear as if the host is simply bundled up.</p><p>Once they've covered the host, raggamoffyns can force the host body to do their collective bidding. Even when captured, intelligent creatures can throw off the effects by force of will; when entrapped by a raggamoffyn, characters need a successful saving throw vs. spell to resist the raggamoffyn's control. Successful saves usually cause most (but not all; see below) raggamoffyns to fly to another host. If failed, the character is under their control, but can make another saving throw at the start of each turn to break free. (Each Intelligence point above 15 subtracts one round from the time, allowing smarter characters to save more quickly.) The saving throws are made as normal against tatterdemanimals and common raggamoffyns, but are at -2 against gutterspites and -4 against a shrapnyl's control.</p><p>When removed from or rejected by their host, raggamoffyns can fly (poorly), like a swarm of scraps caught in a breeze. They can slip through small openings, such as beneath a door or through a portcullis, just by splitting into their component parts.</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Habitat/Society:</b> Raggamoffyns are currently found in dungeons, but are rumored to be popping up in urban settings as well, where they hide as cloaks and capes and piles of rags (the shrapnyl have only been seen in deep underground). They seem driven to create more of their own kind, but they must use others to do so, forcing their hosts to destroy enchanted clothing and perform a quick, silent rite that somehow creates another raggamoffyn. Whether or not the raggamoffyns serve the mage who may have created them is an open question; some say that their drive to create more of their kind is only a preparation for a silent conquest of avilized communities.</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Ecology:</b> In bright light, raggamoffyns are sometimes confused with mummies or <a href=\"/appendix/adherer\">adherers</a> and slain (along with their unfortunate hosts), but in most cases they can pass as human in poor light. Some say that the raggamoffyns are the nonliving variants of a race of <a href=\"/appendix/steeshad\">steel shadows</a> that they serve, metal-animating creatures that dwell underground. Others suggest that the Rag Mage is an illusionist who dabbles in transmutation magics, creating the illusion of life in unliving cloth.</p><p>Raggamoffyns almost never harm their hosts directly. However, they do force their hosts to kill, to steal, or cause mischief (like the destruction of valuable magical items). Unfortunately, the hosts are always left to face the consequences (having been freed by the raggamoffyn) when things go wrong. Because their actions are planned and directed to a definite goal, some sages believe that raggamoffyns serve the ends of their creators.</p><p>Oddly, raggamoffyns (other than gutterspites) do not capture and control <a href=\"/appendix/gnome\">gnomes</a> or <a href=\"/appendix/dwarduer\">duergar</a>; their very natures could make them immune, or it could be a simple whim of the creator, but these creatures never attack these small races.</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Tatterdemanimals</b></p>  <p class=\"ni\">This lesser form of raggamoffyn is the least dangerous, made of small, dirty, and tattered scraps of cloth and able to wrap itself around creatures of size T or S. A tatterdemanimal cannot control a host with more than 3 Hit Dice or a 4 Intelligence; its usual victims are <a href=\"/appendix/rat\">rats</a>, <a href=\"/appendix/dog\">dogs</a>, <a href=\"/appendix/catsmall\">cats</a>, birds, and pigs.</p><p>Tatterdemanimals often gather in small groups and control a group of similar animals, such as a pack of dogs or a flock of pigeons. Oddly, they can fly, although they cannot control the host accurately enough to imitate a bird's flapping wings.</p><p>Tatterdemanimals suffer double damage from fire, but are immune to damage from blunt weapons.</p><p></p><p class=\"f\"><b>Gutterspite</b></p>  <p class=\"ni\">The gutterspite is a rare form of raggamoffyn, barely large enough to control creatures of up to dwarf-size (size S), but not quite large enough to engulf <a href=\"/appendix/elf\">elves</a> or humans. The host size is less important to gutterspites, as they almost always choose to stay with the host they bond with at birth. The gutterspites are the only form of raggamoffyn to cooperate with their hosts, rather than simply dominating them (though they can if the host doesn't cooperate with them). Some even daim that the Rag Mage himself is simply the powerful leader of the gutterspite race.</p><p>Compared to other raggamoffyns and their whirling scraps of wind and fury, the gutterspites are awkward, shambling masses, made of ropes, string, leather straps, and strips of unraveling cloth holding together a small mass of gems, glass, and glitter.</p><p>They can control creatures of up to 10 Intelligene and as much as 4 levels or Hit Dice. A gutterspite's preferred hosts are small, often <a href=\"/appendix/halfling\">halflings</a>, <a href=\"/appendix/dwarf\">dwarves</a>, and gnomes. Gutterspites are the only raggamoffyns that can control gnome and duergar.</p><p>Once a day, a gutterspite can create a sparkling burst of light that shines from its glitter and glass, blinding all opponents in a 20-foot radius who fail a saving throw vs. paralyzation. This blindness lasts for 1-4 rounds, giving the gutterspite and its host enough time to flee or attack. Blinded opponents gain no Dexterity bonus to their Armor Class, and the gutterspite gains an additional +2 bonwto attack rolls against blinded foes. Gutterspites are unaffected by <i>color spray</i>, <i>darkness</i>, <i>light</i>, <i>rainbow</i>, and <i>continual light</i> spells.</p><p></p><p class=\"f\"><b>Common Raggamoffyn</b></p>  <p class=\"ni\">Usually just called raggamoffyns, these bits of leather cloaks, gloves, and armor are the most common (and most dangerous) raggamoffyn in urban areas. They thrive in rubbish heaps, alleys, and mortuaries, where they often include bits of burial shrouds. Common raggamoffyns can control size S or M creatures of up to 15 Intelligence and as much as 6 levels or Hit Dice.</p><p>Common raggamoffyns gather in roving packs on some nights, often controlling the actions of thieves, watchmen, bookkeepers, or other night owls in the city. In rare cases, they asphyxiate hosts who escape their control and might give away their presence to others - the only active attack raggamoffyns use against their own hosts. These strangling attacks are automatic once the raggamoffyn scores a single successful attack against the victim's head (Armor Class 10 without a full face helmet, AC2 with a great helm, Dexterity bonuses and magical rings and bracers apply). After the raggamoffyn plugs up the nose and mouth of the victim and begins to squeeze the throat, the victim must make a Constitution check each round until either the raggamoffyn or the victim is slain. (Spell attacks affect both, but can serve to move the rags born the host.) The first check is normal, but thereafter each additional check adds another -2 penalty. If the check fails, the victim dies of suffocation.</p><p></p><p class=\"f\"><b>Shrapnyl</b></p>  <p class=\"ni\">These powerful creature are made of dozens or even hundreds of shards of metal of all varieties and colors, including bits of iron, brass, tin, and copper. The shrapnyl consist of good-sized bits of metal: entire horseshoes, swords, shields, lanterns, pans, knives, and tableware. They can control hosts up to size L with an 18 Intelligence and up to 9 HD or levels. Their prefered victims are <a href=\"/appendix/ogre\">ogres</a>, mages, or (best of all) <a href=\"/appendix/ogre\">ogre mages</a>. When they seek to disguise themselves, shrapnyl raggamoffyns arrange their metal shards to resemble splint mail armor.</p><p>One of the benefits of this parasite is that the shrapnyl actually acts as armor, taking damage that might normally affect its host (spell effects affect both, except as listed below). If they are exposed to acids, those particular pieces of metal flip over and expose the host to the acid damage as well, dividing the damage of the acid between them (host and shrapnyl each take half damage).</p><p>Once per day, a shrapnyl can explode into a cloud of steel, inflicting 4d10 points of damage on any creature within 10 feet, half upon those that make a successful saving throw vs. breath weapon. The shrapnyl's host is unaffected by the explosion, but thereafter the shrapnyl can no longer control its host. The monster must rest and retreat before finding a new host, so it uses the exploding cloud of steel only in extreme situations.</p><p>Older shrapnyl sometimes include large chunks of gold, silver, or platinum among their scraps, and use them to lure potential hosts near. They may lie still for hours at a time, then suddenly rise up out of a chest or a pile of coins and surround a host. When in its loose metal form, without a host, a shrapnyl can attack five times a round.</p><p>Shrapnyl are vulnerable to <i>crystalbrittle</i>, <i>shatter</i>, and <i>heat metal</i> spells. <i>Shatter</i> causes 3d6 points of damage to a shrapnyl, <i>crystalbrittle</i> affects it without the benefit of a saving throw, and <i>heat metal</i> causes full normal damage to a shrapnyl.</p><p></p><br clear=\"all\" style=\"clear:both; height:0;\">\r\n","images":["<img src=\"grf/xx.gif\" width=\"150\" height=\"75\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Advanced Dungeons & Dragons 2nd Edition\" title=\"Advanced Dungeons & Dragons 2nd Edition\" align=\"right\">","<img src=\"img/raggamof.gif\" alt=\"Raggamoffyn\" title=\"Raggamoffyn\" border=\"0\" width=\"300\" height=\"360\" style=\"text-align:right;\" align=\"right\">","<img src=\"grf/tsr_sm.png\" width=\"56\" height=\"59\" border=\"0\" alt=\"TSR\">"],"setting":"Advanced Dungeons & Dragons 2nd Edition","statblock":{"Common Raggamoffyn":{"Activity Cycle":"Night","Alignment":"Chaotic neutral","Armor Class":"5","Climate/Terrain":"Temperate urban","Damage/Attack":"1d6","Diet":"Carnivore","Frequency":"Uncommon","Hit Dice":"3","Intelligence":"Average (8-10)","Magic Resistance":"Nil","Morale":"Steady (11)","Movement":"12, Fl 8 (E)","No. Appearing":"1-4","No. of Attacks":"1","Organization":"Hive/colony","Size":"M","Special Attacks":"Suffocation, control host","Special Defenses":"Immune to mind-affecting spells","THAC0":"17","Treasure":"Nil (Q&times;3)","XP Value":"270"},"Gutterspite":{"Activity Cycle":"Day","Alignment":"Neutral","Armor Class":"0","Climate/Terrain":"Temperate urban","Damage/Attack":"2d8","Diet":"Carnivore","Frequency":"Rare","Hit Dice":"5","Intelligence":"Very (11-12)","Magic Resistance":"Nil","Morale":"Elite (14)","Movement":"6, Fl 6 (E)","No. Appearing":"1-3","No. of Attacks":"1","Organization":"Hive/colony","Size":"M","Special Attacks":"Blinding, control host","Special Defenses":"Immune to mind-affecting spells","THAC0":"15","Treasure":"Nil (Q&times;3)","XP Value":"1,400"},"Shrapnyl":{"Activity Cycle":"Any","Alignment":"Chaotic evil","Armor Class":"-5","Climate/Terrain":"Temperate urban","Damage/Attack":"2d12 or 1d6 (&times;5)","Diet":"Carnivore","Frequency":"Very Rare","Hit Dice":"7","Intelligence":"High (13-14)","Magic Resistance":"Nil","Morale":"Champion (16)","Movement":"6, Fl 4 (E)","No. Appearing":"1-2","No. of Attacks":"1 or 5","Organization":"Hive/colony","Size":"L","Special Attacks":"Control host, explode","Special Defenses":"Immune to mind-affecting spells","THAC0":"13","Treasure":"Nil (Q&times;3)","XP Value":"3,000"},"Tatterdemanimal":{"Activity Cycle":"Night","Alignment":"Neutral","Armor Class":"10","Climate/Terrain":"Temperate urban","Damage/Attack":"1d2","Diet":"Carnivore","Frequency":"Uncommon","Hit Dice":"1","Intelligence":"Low (5-7)","Magic Resistance":"Nil","Morale":"Unsteady (6)","Movement":"18, Fl 12 (E)","No. Appearing":"1-6","No. of Attacks":"1","Organization":"Hive/colony","Size":"S","Special Attacks":"Control host","Special Defenses":"Immune to blunt weapons and mind-affecting spells","THAC0":"20","Treasure":"Nil","XP Value":"120"}},"title":"Raggamoffyn"},"sources":["1109","2158"],"statblock_names":[],"title":"Raggamoffyn","prev_key":"radispir","next_key":"raibowse","monster_path":"/appendix/raggamof"}},"staticQueryHashes":[],"slicesMap":{}}
