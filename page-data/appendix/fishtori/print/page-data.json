While the powers listed above are the most common, some aarakocra have different or additional powers.</p><p class=\"f\">A race of intelligent, birdlike creatures living in the deepest deserts of Athas, the rare Athasian <a href=\"/appendix/aarakocr\">aarakocra</a> spends its time soaring on thermals in search of food.</p><p>The aarakocra is 7 to 8 feet tall with a wingspan of 20 feet or more. Because of its large wingspan, an aarakocra can carry as much as 75% of its own body weight and still fly easily. An aarakocra can fly a short distance carrying a burden equaling 125% of its own body weight. The average body weight of a full grown male is 100 pounds and a female is 85 pounds.</p><p>Each wing has a &ldquo;hand&rdquo; at its midpoint, consisting of three fingers and an opposable thumb. The fourth finger forms the rigid leading edge of the wing. In flight the hands cannot be used, but on the ground the aarakocra can use its hands almost as a human would. The aarakocra's body is protected by a thin bony plate on the chest, much like a solid rib cage. Talons on its legs can be used as claws and can be retracted to reveal a second set of hands, also with three fingers and an opposable thumb. Except for the chest plate, the entire skeleton is hollow and extremely fragile.</p><p>From a distance, the Athasian aarakocra resembles a huge <a href=\"/appendix/bird\">vulture</a>. Its black eyes, set in the front of the head, provide excellent vision over a long range. The plumage is generally black with a white collar for adult males and black or brown with a smaller white collar for females. Adolescents are a mixture of brown and black. The beak is large and covers most of the head. Plumage begins at the crown of the head and is darker near the head, except for the collar. Athasian aarakocra speak their own language and the languages of vultures and other large birds. Some speak the common tongue (5% to 10% chance depending on how deep in the wastelands a tribe lives).</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Combat:</b> Aarakocra can fight in the air or on the ground. They prefer aerial combat since their bones are too fragile to withstand a solid blow from a human-sized opponent. In combat against creatures on the ground, they prefer to fly over their victim and drop weighted nets. Some aarakocra use darts to harass ground-based opponents.</p><p>If their opponents can fly, the aarakocra generally forgo the use of the net, although large groups sometimes use nets on flying creatures. Normally, aarakocra attack flying creatures with long spears, diving from above and allowing the momentum to carry the spear through the target. Such an attack doubles the damage if the aarakocra have been able to dive at least 50 feet. Only the very largest aarakocra can carry more than one of these spears, they can attack with both at once with no penalty, causing double damage on each strike. All diving attacks are made at +4 and should be treated as a charge attack. All other penalties and restrictions of charge attacks apply.</p><p>The effect of the aarakocra's nets depends on if the opponent is flying at the time it becomes entangled. Creatures on the ground that are hit by a net are entangled and unable to participate in any combat until they make a successful Strength check to get free of the net. Flying creatures hit by a net can no longer fly and immediately begin falling. If they cannot escape the net or use some magical means to arrest the fall, normal falling damage applies.</p><p>Unless victims are entangled in nets, aarakocra are cautious in ground combat. If the aarakocra outnumber their opponents they advance in a straight line and thrust with their spears. If outnumbered, or the opponents are particularly tough, the aarakocra withdraw. Victims entangled in nets are killed or incapacitated for use as food or ransom.</p><p>Athasian aarakocra are mindful of their physical limitations as well as their comparatively low psionic abilities. They do not normally initiate psionic combat. At the first sign of psionic powers from any of their victims, however, all aarakocra that have some ability will use whatever attack and defense modes they can in an attempt to destroy the threat. Large groups of is or more aarakocra may initiate psionic combat if their leaders feel they can win quickly and avoid physical combat.</p><p>In desperation, an aarakocra can attempt to bite an opponent in combat. Because of the unwieldiness of its beak, the aarakocra has a THAC0 of 18 if attacking with this appendage. Further, the birdman causes only 1d2 points of damage with the beak.</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Habitat/Society:</b> Athasian aarakocra live in tribes with 6-20 (2d8+4) members, depending on the prestige of the leader. The largest tribe ever recorded had 50 members. The tribal hunting territory depends on the size of the tribe, usually about 500 square miles for a tribe of 10 members. There are no rigid boundaries between tribes and border disputes are not uncommon.</p><p>Alignments of tribe members are similar to the alignment of the leader. A tribe that has a leader who is neutral good may have neutral good, chaotic good, lawful good, and true neutral members. A predominantly evil tribe does not recognize boundaries with other tribes and treats other tribes as inferior beings to be eliminated.</p><p>Athasian aarakocra aren't happy in enclosed spaces, but they they take refuge in a cave or building if necessary.</p><p>Nonevil tribes live in rocky aeries in the highest peaks they can find. Evil tribes are normally nomadic and use an aerie made by another tribe if they need to remain in an area for a long time, even if they have to evict the tribe that made the nest.</p><p>Aarakocra aren't friendly toward intruders in their territory, especially caravans. They try to extract a toll from the caravan for passage through the desert. Good-aligned tribes allow unhindered passage of caravans that pay a tribute. If someone refuses to pay the tribute, the aarakocra try to capture scouts or outriders from the party and hold them until an even larger tribute is paid. The payment may be either livestock or shiny objects. Aarakocra are smart enough not to be taken in by glass baubles instead of gems, although they cannot tell the difference between the more common gems and the rare ones.</p><p>Evil tribes ask for tribute and often attack a caravan whether it pays or not. Aarakocra always demand shiny objects such as stones. These tribes find humans and demihumans to be quite tasty and prefer them to other food.</p><p>Good-aligned tribes of aarakocra sometimes return a lost traveler to the edge of the desert after first removing any valuables the traveler may be carrying. On very rare occasions a tribe might return a lost group of travelers to the more frequently traveled parts of the desert, again after first taking any valuables as payment.</p><p>The oldest male is the leader of the tribal hunting party and has 4+4 Hit Dice. The oldest female is in charge of the tribal aerie and has 3+3 HD. In tribes that have more than 15 members, the next oldest aarakocra serves as shaman and has 3+3 HD; the shaman completes the triumvirate necessary for proper worship and the summoning of elementals. (Interestingly, no magic-using aarakocra has ever been recorded.) Tribes without a shaman cannot summon <a href=\"/appendix/element1\">air elementals</a>, which is an important part of aarakocra culture.</p><p>The shaman is the leader of the daily sun worship. Aarakocra worship the sun because it provides them with the thermals they need to soar in search of food. The shaman also leads the mystic rituals used to summon an air elemental. Summoning an air elemental is usually done only in preparation for the tribe's most sacred ceremony, the hunt. Small tribes must band together for this ceremony to allow the triumvirate to be formed.</p><p>The ceremony to summon an air elemental must be conducted at dawn and requires the oldest male and female to emit a highpitched keening whistle. The shaman conducts an intricate dance around them, simultaneously chanting an ancient summoning mantra.</p><p>The hunt is the final part of the initiation of adolescent aarakocra to adulthood and often takes the tribe far from their normal teritory. The target is always a <a href=\"/appendix/drakalsi\">silt drake</a>. The hunt is the only time the females leave the relative safety of the nest. Even an evil tribe will not interfere with a tribe on a hunt. An air elemental is often summoned to help find the drake, but never takes part in the actual combat. Although the adult members of the tribe take part in the initial phases of the combat, it is the initiates who deliver the final, killing blows to me drake. Scars from the hunt are considered a mark of pride among all aarakocra.</p><p>The females spend about eight months of the year incubating their eggs. Athasian aarakocra mate for life and a pair normally produces as many as 10 offspring. A female lays one egg a year. Constant incubation is not required because of the high daytime temperatures, so the females can maintain the nest and keep the tribe's treasure in order.</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Ecology:</b> Athasian aarakocra are high on the food chain and have no natural enemies other than <a href=\"/appendix/drakatha\">drakes</a>. Unless evil, aarakocra leave their own territory only to hunt the silt drake and return as soon as possible when the hunt is over. (Evil aarakocra attack others, as noted above.) Aarakocra eggs and hatchlings are sought after by wealthy land owners who wish to use the creatures as scouts and sentries. An egg can bring as much as 10 cp in Tyr's marketplace. Tribes that have had eggs or hatchlings stolen have long memories and sometimes take revenge against the thief at a later date. Captive aarakocra join any tribe they come in contact with.</p><p>Athasian aarakocra have a natural life span of 21-30 years.</p><p></p><br clear=\"all\" style=\"clear:both; height:0;\">\r\n","images":["<img src=\"grf/ds.gif\" width=\"150\" height=\"75\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Dark Sun\" title=\"Dark Sun\" align=\"right\">","<img src=\"img/aarakath.gif\" alt=\"Aarakocra (Athas)\" title=\"Aarakocra (Athas)\" border=\"0\" width=\"300\" height=\"360\" style=\"text-align:right;\" align=\"right\">","<img src=\"grf/add2_01.gif\" width=\"200\" height=\"56\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Advanced Dungeons & Dragons 2nd Edition\">"],"setting":"Dark Sun","statblock":{"Aarakocra (Athas)":{"Activity Cycle":"Day","Alignment":"Any","Armor Class":"7","Climate/Terrain":"Deep desert","Damage/Attack":"1d3/1d3 or by weapon","Diet":"Carnivore","Frequency":"Rare","Hit Dice":"2+2","Intelligence":"Average (8-10)","Magic Resistance":"Nil","Morale":"Steady (11)","Movement":"6, Fl 36 (C)","No. Appearing":"1d10","No. of Attacks":"2","Organization":"Tribal","Size":"M (20'+ wingspan)","Special Attacks":"Nil","Special Defenses":"Nil","THAC0":"17","Treasure":"Varies","XP Value":"65"}},"title":"Aarakocra (Athas)"},"sources":["2433"],"statblock_names":[],"title":"Aarakocra (Athas)","prev_key":"zygraat","next_key":"aarakocr","monster_path":"/appendix/aarakath"}}},"pageContext":{"monster_key":"fishtori","monster_data":{"TSR":["2158","9302"],"fullBody":"  <table cellspacing=\"0\" cellpadding=\"0\"><tr class=\"bk\"><th> </th><th class=\"cn\">Floating Eye</th><th class=\"cn\">Hetfish</th><th class=\"cn\">Masher</th><th class=\"cn\">Verme</th></tr><tr><th>Climate/Terrain:</th><td>Any ocean</td><td>Any water</td><td>Tropical coral reef</td><td>Any/Large rivers</td></tr><tr><th>Frequency:</th><td>Rare</td><td>Uncommon</td><td>Uncommon</td><td>Very rare</td></tr><tr><th>Organization:</th><td>School</td><td>Den</td><td>School</td><td>Solitary</td></tr><tr><th>Activity Cycle:</th><td>Any</td><td>Any</td><td>Night</td><td>Any</td></tr><tr><th>Diet:</th><td>Carnivore</td><td>Omnivore</td><td>Carnivore</td><td>Carnivore</td></tr><tr><th>Intelligence:</th><td>Non- (0)</td><td>Low (5)</td><td>Non- (0)</td><td>Animal (1)</td></tr><tr><th>Treasure:</th><td>Nil</td><td>Nil (Q&times;3)</td><td>Nil</td><td>See below</td></tr><tr><th>Alignment:</th><td>Neutral</td><td>Neutral</td><td>Neutral</td><td>Neutral</td></tr><tr><th>No. Appearing:</th><td>1-12</td><td>20-70</td><td>24</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><th>Armor Class:</th><td>9</td><td>5</td><td>7</td><td>3 (head)/8 (body)</td></tr><tr><th>Movement:</th><td>Sw 30</td><td>Sw 12</td><td>Sw 9</td><td>3, Sw 18</td></tr><tr><th>Hit Dice:</th><td>1-4 hp</td><td>1-3</td><td>8</td><td>18+18</td></tr><tr><th>THAC0:</th><td>20</td><td>1-2 HD: 19<br>3 HD: 17</td><td>13</td><td>5</td></tr><tr><th>No. of Attacks:</th><td>Special only</td><td>1</td><td>1</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><th>Damage/Attack:</th><td>Nil</td><td>1</td><td>5d4</td><td>7-28</td></tr><tr><th>Special Attacks:</th><td>Hypnotism</td><td>Heat</td><td>Nil</td><td>Swallow whole</td></tr><tr><th>Special Defenses:</th><td>Nil</td><td>Nil</td><td>Poison spines</td><td>See below</td></tr><tr><th>Magic Resistance:</th><td>Nil</td><td>Nil</td><td>Nil</td><td>Nil</td></tr><tr><th>Size:</th><td>S (1' long)</td><td>S (1-3' long)</td><td>H (12-15' long)</td><td>G (50-80' long)</td></tr><tr><th>Morale:</th><td>Unsteady (5)</td><td>Unsteady (7)</td><td>Average (10)</td><td>Champion (15)</td></tr><tr><th>XP Value:</th><td>35</td><td>Varies</td><td>1,400</td><td>14,000</td></tr></table><h2><img src=\"/img/spc/fishtor1.gif\" width=\"300\" height=\"360\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Floating Eye\" title=\"Floating Eye\" style=\"float:right;\">Floating Eye</h2><p class=\"f\">Floating eyes are one of the undersea wonders, a salt-water fish of very unusual nature. The floating eye has a transparent body, practically invisible in the water, with a single large eye of about three inches in diameter (about the only thing that is readily visible of the fish). The eye is mostly milky white, with a large black pupil. If the pupil is gazed upon, tiny bolts of light appear to streak out from the center every few seconds.</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Combat:</b> The floating eye is a poor combatant, but it has a significant effect on its surroundings. Any creature that is within 30 feet and stares into the eye must make a successful saving throw vs. paralyzation or hang immobile in the water, hypnotized. This is a useful defense for the floating eye. Another good defense is the floating eye's speed, as it is one of the fastest underwater creatures.</p><p>Predatory marine animals, such as <a href=\"/appendix/piranha\">piranhas</a>, <a href=\"/appendix/shark\">sharks</a>, or <a href=\"/appendix/ray\">manta rays</a>, have learned to keep close to floating eyes, while avoiding their hypnotic effects. These fish then attack any large prey that is immobilized by the school of floating eyes. The eyes feed upon the scraps that remain.</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Habitat/Society:</b> Floating eyes silently patrol their oceans, looking for small creatures they can hypnotize and eat. They are mild and non-aggressive, keeping in schools of a dozen or fewer. They abandon their young at birth and if lacking food they will eat the small floating eyes.</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Ecology:</b> The floating eye does not have a significantly damaging attack. If it was alone with man-sized prey, it might be able to cause 1 point of damage every ten rounds or so. On the whole, it prefers brine and plankton. However, the symbiotic relationship mentioned above works well, and virtually every pack of floating eyes has a following of predator fish.</p><p>Some adventurers have tried to imitate the predators' trick by capturing and carrying floating eyes. But the floating eye loses its magical powers immediately upon death, and there are difficulties with carrying fishbowls lnto perilous situations.</p><p>Alchemists have for many years sought floating eyes. Most are certain that the eye is useful as an ingredient in some potion or scroll mk, but as yet no specific use has been found.</p><h2><img src=\"/img/spc/fishtor2.gif\" width=\"300\" height=\"360\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Hetfish\" title=\"Hetfish\" style=\"float:left;\">Hetfish</h2><p class=\"f\">The hetfish, or hotfish as some sailors know it, is another wonder of the undersea world. It is a small (one to three feet long) silver-and-orange fish, whose skin is covered by unseemly bumps and boils. It is found in both fresh and salt water, from arctic climes to boiling hot springs. Its basic body shape resembles that of a <a href=\"/appendix/piranha\">piranha</a>, although it has neither the piranha's teeth nor its distinctive underbite.</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Combat:</b> Hetfish have super-heated bodies whose temperatures exceed 350 degrees Fahrenheit. This effectively turns the water within several inches of them to steam.</p><p>When their den is disturbed, these fish swarm en masse to meet the intruder. Each hetfish has as many Hit Dice as feet in length (one to three), and the entire den bumps or rams the intruders, doing 1 point of damage per fish. Hetfish have been known to continue these attacks indefinitely, long after the target has been boiled to bone.</p><p>Even if a victim cannot be touched directly, he can be injured by merely remaining in the vicinity of hetfish for too long. Every round a creature swims within 20 feet of a den of hetfish, it suffers 2 points of damage from the hot water.</p><p>Hetfish are possessed of a simple intelligence; they are attracted to bright, shiny things, particularly gemstones. A hetfish coral den, when broken open, contains one gemstone for each fish, with a base value of 10 gp. Some hetfish communities have learned that ships often carry such pretty things, and they try to ram ships and sink them for treasure. Wooden ships sustain 1 point of hull damage per 15 Hit Dice of hetfish attacking, per round.</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Habitat/Society:</b> Hetfish live in large communal dens. They are about as intelligent as bright <a href=\"/appendix/dog\">dogs</a>, or particularly dull <a href=\"/appendix/gnoll\">gnolls</a>. They have nothing resembling a language. They seem content to swim about and patrol a territory that is 50 feet in radius per hetfish in the den. Any creature entering this area is considered fair prey by the fish, regardless of its size or ferocity There are very few creatures that can endure 30-40 points of damage each round, and thus there are very few creatures that live in the hetfish's territory.</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Ecology:</b> It seems that the hetfish requires a steam environment for respiration, as it is unable to breathe water. How it continues to buoy itself up in the water is just one of the hetfish's mysteries. However, because of its heat-producing powers, the hetfish's greatest threats are civilized races. Underwater races, such as the <a href=\"/appendix/triton\">tritons</a>, hunt hetfish ruthlessly, as the super-heated fish are an environmental hazard in any but the hottest natural springs. Surface dwellers hunt hetfish as well, not merely for the gemstones the fish collect or to guard against hetfish sinking more boats. Alive, the animals are worth 10d10 gp apiece to alchemists and sages, for no one has yet learned the secret of the hetfish's strange properties, which resemble those of the <a href=\"/appendix/remorhaz\">remorharz</a>.</p><h2><img src=\"/img/spc/fishtor3.gif\" width=\"300\" height=\"360\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Coral\" title=\"Coral Masher\" style=\"float:right;\">Masher</h2><p class=\"f\">The masher, or coral masher, still another wonder of the undersea world, is a large, worm-like fish that moves slowly along coral reefs, crushing and digesting the coral. A masher is longer than most humanoid races are tall, and it is colored a rusty red with two bright blue dorsal ridges.</p><p>The coral masher is not an aggressive creature, but it is easily surprised. If it feels threatened, it attacks in self-defense.</p><p>Each of its dorsal ridges carries two to four spines, each four feet long or longer, and each able to secrete a virulent poison. When threatened, the masher flares these ridges, keeping enemies at bay. Any attacker must either use a weapon with a thrusting tip at least six feet from the hand, or be struck with a spine (requiring a successful saving throw vs. poison to prevent death after one turn; a successful saving throw indicates no damage)</p><p>Some adventurers have spread rumors that the coral masher can be successfully attacked by positioning oneself directly in front of or beneath the creature. This is poor advice; the masher can maneuver much faster than humanoid attackers, and it can twist or roll to injure its attackers.</p><p>The coral masher's poison is very complex; no known antidote exists, save such spells as <i>neutralize poison</i>. For this reason, the coral masher is harassed now and again for its venom.</p><h2><img src=\"/img/spc/fishtor4.gif\" width=\"300\" height=\"360\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Verme\" title=\"Verme\" style=\"float:left;\">Verme</h2><p class=\"f\">The verme is the largest of fish, yet another wonder of the undersea world. It resembles a <a href=\"/appendix/fishgian\">giant catfish</a>, except that it has large, thick, slime-covered scales and hundreds of long, needle-like teeth. It is yellow along its belly, with its flanks dark brown shading to a mottled green-and-brown back.</p><p>Although the verme is gigantically long, it is flattish along its belly, and wider than it is high. This enables it to lurk on the bottom and swim in reasonably shallow rivers.</p><p>The verme is a voracious carnivore, eating two tons of meat each day to sustain itself. Should a character attempt <i>speak with animals</i> spell on a verme, the fish will express no surprise that it is being spoken to. Indeed, it will only grow irritated that someone is keeping it from eating its fill.</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Combat:</b> A verme's head is covered with a thick bone plate, giving it an AC of 3. The body is AC 8.</p><p>A verme swallows any opponent under 12 feet tall should it score a hit. It tries to swallow those characters who are attacking its head before maneuvering to reach those beating on its sides. The victim suffers 3d8+4 points of damage upon being swallowed, and an additional 2d8 points each round thereafter. No matter how many points of damage a creature inside a verme has suffered, it dies in six rounds and dissolve. On the bright side, a verme is AC 10 when attacked from the inside.</p><p>The monster fish is able to upset almost any boat and ships of up to small galley size when hungry and seeking food.</p><p>Its thick, slime-covered scales make edged weapons almost useless. Such attacks inflict only 1 point of damage each blow. Fire-based attacks inflict half damage to the verme, unless an attack strikes the inside of the mouth or somewhere internally. In the latter case, the damage is enhanced, gaining a +1 bonus per die of damage.</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Habitat/Society:</b> Verme usually inhabit great rivers, but sometimes venture into saltwater. Regardless of the locale, it prefers warm water with an abundance of food, such as fish, reptiles, cattle, humans, or virtually anything else.</p><p>Because verme can swallow prey whole, even animals the size of water buffaloes, their stomachs can contain metallic or other indigestible material.</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Ecology:</b> A verme spells ecological disaster for whatever area it settles in. It can scour rivers clean of fish, or rid swamps of all water-borne life. Verme have destroyed the economies of entire city-states, just by roaming the waters upriver. A verme appearing in a city's waterways is a frightening prospect.</p><p>Adventuring parties occasionally hunt verme for their dorsal scales, which can be powdered and used as one ingredient in the ink for a <i>shield</i> spell. The scales from one verme can supply enough material for several dozen spells.</p><p></p><br clear=\"all\" style=\"clear:both; height:0;\">\r\n","images":["<img src=\"grf/gh.gif\" width=\"150\" height=\"75\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Greyhawk\" title=\"Greyhawk\" align=\"right\">","<img src=\"img/fishtori.gif\" alt=\"Fish (Toril)\" title=\"Fish (Toril)\" border=\"0\" width=\"300\" height=\"360\" style=\"text-align:right;\" align=\"right\">","<img src=\"/img/spc/fishtor1.gif\" width=\"300\" height=\"360\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Floating Eye\" title=\"Floating Eye\" style=\"float:right;\">","<img src=\"/img/spc/fishtor2.gif\" width=\"300\" height=\"360\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Hetfish\" title=\"Hetfish\" style=\"float:left;\">","<img src=\"/img/spc/fishtor3.gif\" width=\"300\" height=\"360\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Coral\" title=\"Coral Masher\" style=\"float:right;\">","<img src=\"/img/spc/fishtor4.gif\" width=\"300\" height=\"360\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Verme\" title=\"Verme\" style=\"float:left;\">","<img src=\"grf/add2_01.gif\" width=\"200\" height=\"56\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Advanced Dungeons & Dragons 2nd Edition\">"],"setting":"Greyhawk","statblock":{"Floating Eye":{"Activity Cycle":"Any","Alignment":"Neutral","Armor Class":"9","Climate/Terrain":"Any ocean","Damage/Attack":"Nil","Diet":"Carnivore","Frequency":"Rare","Hit Dice":"1-4 hp","Intelligence":"Non- (0)","Magic Resistance":"Nil","Morale":"Unsteady (5)","Movement":"Sw 30","No. Appearing":"1-12","No. of Attacks":"Special only","Organization":"School","Size":"S (1' long)","Special Attacks":"Hypnotism","Special Defenses":"Nil","THAC0":"20","Treasure":"Nil","XP Value":"35"},"Hetfish":{"Activity Cycle":"Any","Alignment":"Neutral","Armor Class":"5","Climate/Terrain":"Any water","Damage/Attack":"1","Diet":"Omnivore","Frequency":"Uncommon","Hit Dice":"1-3","Intelligence":"Low (5)","Magic Resistance":"Nil","Morale":"Unsteady (7)","Movement":"Sw 12","No. Appearing":"20-70","No. of Attacks":"1","Organization":"Den","Size":"S (1-3' long)","Special Attacks":"Heat","Special Defenses":"Nil","THAC0":"1-2 HD: 19<br>3 HD: 17","Treasure":"Nil (Q&times;3)","XP Value":"Varies"},"Masher":{"Activity Cycle":"Night","Alignment":"Neutral","Armor Class":"7","Climate/Terrain":"Tropical coral reef","Damage/Attack":"5d4","Diet":"Carnivore","Frequency":"Uncommon","Hit Dice":"8","Intelligence":"Non- (0)","Magic Resistance":"Nil","Morale":"Average (10)","Movement":"Sw 9","No. Appearing":"24","No. of Attacks":"1","Organization":"School","Size":"H (12-15' long)","Special Attacks":"Nil","Special Defenses":"Poison spines","THAC0":"13","Treasure":"Nil","XP Value":"1,400"},"Verme":{"Activity Cycle":"Any","Alignment":"Neutral","Armor Class":"3 (head)/8 (body)","Climate/Terrain":"Any/Large rivers","Damage/Attack":"7-28","Diet":"Carnivore","Frequency":"Very rare","Hit Dice":"18+18","Intelligence":"Animal (1)","Magic Resistance":"Nil","Morale":"Champion (15)","Movement":"3, Sw 18","No. Appearing":"1","No. of Attacks":"1","Organization":"Solitary","Size":"G (50-80' long)","Special Attacks":"Swallow whole","Special Defenses":"See below","THAC0":"5","Treasure":"See below","XP Value":"14,000"}},"title":"Fish (Toril)"},"sources":["2158","9302"],"statblock_names":[],"title":"Fish (Toril)","prev_key":"fishsubt","next_key":"fishtrop","monster_path":"/appendix/fishtori"}},"staticQueryHashes":[],"slicesMap":{}}
