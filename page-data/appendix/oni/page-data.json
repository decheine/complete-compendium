While the powers listed above are the most common, some aarakocra have different or additional powers.</p><p class=\"f\">A race of intelligent, birdlike creatures living in the deepest deserts of Athas, the rare Athasian <a href=\"/appendix/aarakocr\">aarakocra</a> spends its time soaring on thermals in search of food.</p><p>The aarakocra is 7 to 8 feet tall with a wingspan of 20 feet or more. Because of its large wingspan, an aarakocra can carry as much as 75% of its own body weight and still fly easily. An aarakocra can fly a short distance carrying a burden equaling 125% of its own body weight. The average body weight of a full grown male is 100 pounds and a female is 85 pounds.</p><p>Each wing has a &ldquo;hand&rdquo; at its midpoint, consisting of three fingers and an opposable thumb. The fourth finger forms the rigid leading edge of the wing. In flight the hands cannot be used, but on the ground the aarakocra can use its hands almost as a human would. The aarakocra's body is protected by a thin bony plate on the chest, much like a solid rib cage. Talons on its legs can be used as claws and can be retracted to reveal a second set of hands, also with three fingers and an opposable thumb. Except for the chest plate, the entire skeleton is hollow and extremely fragile.</p><p>From a distance, the Athasian aarakocra resembles a huge <a href=\"/appendix/bird\">vulture</a>. Its black eyes, set in the front of the head, provide excellent vision over a long range. The plumage is generally black with a white collar for adult males and black or brown with a smaller white collar for females. Adolescents are a mixture of brown and black. The beak is large and covers most of the head. Plumage begins at the crown of the head and is darker near the head, except for the collar. Athasian aarakocra speak their own language and the languages of vultures and other large birds. Some speak the common tongue (5% to 10% chance depending on how deep in the wastelands a tribe lives).</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Combat:</b> Aarakocra can fight in the air or on the ground. They prefer aerial combat since their bones are too fragile to withstand a solid blow from a human-sized opponent. In combat against creatures on the ground, they prefer to fly over their victim and drop weighted nets. Some aarakocra use darts to harass ground-based opponents.</p><p>If their opponents can fly, the aarakocra generally forgo the use of the net, although large groups sometimes use nets on flying creatures. Normally, aarakocra attack flying creatures with long spears, diving from above and allowing the momentum to carry the spear through the target. Such an attack doubles the damage if the aarakocra have been able to dive at least 50 feet. Only the very largest aarakocra can carry more than one of these spears, they can attack with both at once with no penalty, causing double damage on each strike. All diving attacks are made at +4 and should be treated as a charge attack. All other penalties and restrictions of charge attacks apply.</p><p>The effect of the aarakocra's nets depends on if the opponent is flying at the time it becomes entangled. Creatures on the ground that are hit by a net are entangled and unable to participate in any combat until they make a successful Strength check to get free of the net. Flying creatures hit by a net can no longer fly and immediately begin falling. If they cannot escape the net or use some magical means to arrest the fall, normal falling damage applies.</p><p>Unless victims are entangled in nets, aarakocra are cautious in ground combat. If the aarakocra outnumber their opponents they advance in a straight line and thrust with their spears. If outnumbered, or the opponents are particularly tough, the aarakocra withdraw. Victims entangled in nets are killed or incapacitated for use as food or ransom.</p><p>Athasian aarakocra are mindful of their physical limitations as well as their comparatively low psionic abilities. They do not normally initiate psionic combat. At the first sign of psionic powers from any of their victims, however, all aarakocra that have some ability will use whatever attack and defense modes they can in an attempt to destroy the threat. Large groups of is or more aarakocra may initiate psionic combat if their leaders feel they can win quickly and avoid physical combat.</p><p>In desperation, an aarakocra can attempt to bite an opponent in combat. Because of the unwieldiness of its beak, the aarakocra has a THAC0 of 18 if attacking with this appendage. Further, the birdman causes only 1d2 points of damage with the beak.</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Habitat/Society:</b> Athasian aarakocra live in tribes with 6-20 (2d8+4) members, depending on the prestige of the leader. The largest tribe ever recorded had 50 members. The tribal hunting territory depends on the size of the tribe, usually about 500 square miles for a tribe of 10 members. There are no rigid boundaries between tribes and border disputes are not uncommon.</p><p>Alignments of tribe members are similar to the alignment of the leader. A tribe that has a leader who is neutral good may have neutral good, chaotic good, lawful good, and true neutral members. A predominantly evil tribe does not recognize boundaries with other tribes and treats other tribes as inferior beings to be eliminated.</p><p>Athasian aarakocra aren't happy in enclosed spaces, but they they take refuge in a cave or building if necessary.</p><p>Nonevil tribes live in rocky aeries in the highest peaks they can find. Evil tribes are normally nomadic and use an aerie made by another tribe if they need to remain in an area for a long time, even if they have to evict the tribe that made the nest.</p><p>Aarakocra aren't friendly toward intruders in their territory, especially caravans. They try to extract a toll from the caravan for passage through the desert. Good-aligned tribes allow unhindered passage of caravans that pay a tribute. If someone refuses to pay the tribute, the aarakocra try to capture scouts or outriders from the party and hold them until an even larger tribute is paid. The payment may be either livestock or shiny objects. Aarakocra are smart enough not to be taken in by glass baubles instead of gems, although they cannot tell the difference between the more common gems and the rare ones.</p><p>Evil tribes ask for tribute and often attack a caravan whether it pays or not. Aarakocra always demand shiny objects such as stones. These tribes find humans and demihumans to be quite tasty and prefer them to other food.</p><p>Good-aligned tribes of aarakocra sometimes return a lost traveler to the edge of the desert after first removing any valuables the traveler may be carrying. On very rare occasions a tribe might return a lost group of travelers to the more frequently traveled parts of the desert, again after first taking any valuables as payment.</p><p>The oldest male is the leader of the tribal hunting party and has 4+4 Hit Dice. The oldest female is in charge of the tribal aerie and has 3+3 HD. In tribes that have more than 15 members, the next oldest aarakocra serves as shaman and has 3+3 HD; the shaman completes the triumvirate necessary for proper worship and the summoning of elementals. (Interestingly, no magic-using aarakocra has ever been recorded.) Tribes without a shaman cannot summon <a href=\"/appendix/element1\">air elementals</a>, which is an important part of aarakocra culture.</p><p>The shaman is the leader of the daily sun worship. Aarakocra worship the sun because it provides them with the thermals they need to soar in search of food. The shaman also leads the mystic rituals used to summon an air elemental. Summoning an air elemental is usually done only in preparation for the tribe's most sacred ceremony, the hunt. Small tribes must band together for this ceremony to allow the triumvirate to be formed.</p><p>The ceremony to summon an air elemental must be conducted at dawn and requires the oldest male and female to emit a highpitched keening whistle. The shaman conducts an intricate dance around them, simultaneously chanting an ancient summoning mantra.</p><p>The hunt is the final part of the initiation of adolescent aarakocra to adulthood and often takes the tribe far from their normal teritory. The target is always a <a href=\"/appendix/drakalsi\">silt drake</a>. The hunt is the only time the females leave the relative safety of the nest. Even an evil tribe will not interfere with a tribe on a hunt. An air elemental is often summoned to help find the drake, but never takes part in the actual combat. Although the adult members of the tribe take part in the initial phases of the combat, it is the initiates who deliver the final, killing blows to me drake. Scars from the hunt are considered a mark of pride among all aarakocra.</p><p>The females spend about eight months of the year incubating their eggs. Athasian aarakocra mate for life and a pair normally produces as many as 10 offspring. A female lays one egg a year. Constant incubation is not required because of the high daytime temperatures, so the females can maintain the nest and keep the tribe's treasure in order.</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Ecology:</b> Athasian aarakocra are high on the food chain and have no natural enemies other than <a href=\"/appendix/drakatha\">drakes</a>. Unless evil, aarakocra leave their own territory only to hunt the silt drake and return as soon as possible when the hunt is over. (Evil aarakocra attack others, as noted above.) Aarakocra eggs and hatchlings are sought after by wealthy land owners who wish to use the creatures as scouts and sentries. An egg can bring as much as 10 cp in Tyr's marketplace. Tribes that have had eggs or hatchlings stolen have long memories and sometimes take revenge against the thief at a later date. Captive aarakocra join any tribe they come in contact with.</p><p>Athasian aarakocra have a natural life span of 21-30 years.</p>\n","images":["<img src=\"grf/ds.gif\" width=\"150\" height=\"75\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Dark Sun\" title=\"Dark Sun\" align=\"right\">","<img src=\"img/aarakath.gif\" alt=\"Aarakocra (Athas)\" title=\"Aarakocra (Athas)\" border=\"0\" width=\"300\" height=\"360\" style=\"text-align:right;\" align=\"right\">","<img src=\"grf/add2_01.gif\" width=\"200\" height=\"56\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Advanced Dungeons & Dragons 2nd Edition\">"],"setting":"Dark Sun","statblock":{"Aarakocra (Athas)":{"Activity Cycle":"Day","Alignment":"Any","Armor Class":"7","Climate/Terrain":"Deep desert","Damage/Attack":"1d3/1d3 or by weapon","Diet":"Carnivore","Frequency":"Rare","Hit Dice":"2+2","Intelligence":"Average (8-10)","Magic Resistance":"Nil","Morale":"Steady (11)","Movement":"6, Fl 36 (C)","No. Appearing":"1d10","No. of Attacks":"2","Organization":"Tribal","Size":"M (20'+ wingspan)","Special Attacks":"Nil","Special Defenses":"Nil","THAC0":"17","Treasure":"Varies","XP Value":"65"}},"title":"Aarakocra (Athas)"},"sources":["2433"],"statblock_names":[],"title":"Aarakocra (Athas)","prev_key":"zygraat","next_key":"aarakocr","monster_path":"/appendix/aarakath"}}},"pageContext":{"monster_key":"oni","monster_data":{"TSR":["2116"],"fullBody":"  <table cellspacing=\"0\" cellpadding=\"0\"><tr class=\"bk\"><th> </th><th class=\"cn\">Common Oni</th><th class=\"cn\">Go-Zu-Oni</th><th class=\"cn\">Me-Zu-Oni</th></tr><tr><th>Climate/Terrain:</th><td>Temperate mountains, hills, plains, forests, and subterranean</td><td>Any land</td><td>Any land</td></tr><tr><th>Frequency:</th><td>Rare</td><td>Very rare</td><td>Very rare</td></tr><tr><th>Organization:</th><td>Solitary or band</td><td>Solitary or band</td><td>Solitary or band</td></tr><tr><th>Activity Cycle:</th><td>Any</td><td>Any</td><td>Any</td></tr><tr><th>Diet:</th><td>Carnivore</td><td>Carnivore</td><td>Carnivore</td></tr><tr><th>Intelligence:</th><td>Average (8-10)</td><td>High (13-14)</td><td>High (13-14)</td></tr><tr><th>Treasure:</th><td>A</td><td>S</td><td>S</td></tr><tr><th>Alignment:</th><td>Lawful evil</td><td>Lawful neutral</td><td>Lawful neutral</td></tr><tr><th>No. Appearing:</th><td>1-100</td><td>1-20</td><td>1-20</td></tr><tr><th>Armor Class:</th><td>4</td><td>0</td><td>2</td></tr><tr><th>Movement:</th><td>9</td><td>9</td><td>12</td></tr><tr><th>Hit Dice:</th><td>8</td><td>12+8</td><td>10+5</td></tr><tr><th>THAC0:</th><td>13</td><td>9</td><td>11</td></tr><tr><th>No. of Attacks:</th><td>2</td><td>3</td><td>2</td></tr><tr><th>Damage/Attack:</th><td>3-10/3-10</td><td>6-16/6-16/1-10</td><td>3-18/3-18</td></tr><tr><th>Special Attacks:</th><td>Spells</td><td>See below</td><td>See below</td></tr><tr><th>Special Defenses:</th><td>Nil</td><td>Regeneration</td><td>Regeneration</td></tr><tr><th>Magic Resistance:</th><td>Nil</td><td>20%</td><td>40%</td></tr><tr><th>Size:</th><td>L (7-8' tall)</td><td>L (8-9' tall)</td><td>L (9'+ tall)</td></tr><tr><th>Morale:</th><td>Elite (13)</td><td>Champion (15)</td><td>Elite (14)</td></tr><tr><th>XP Value:</th><td>1,400</td><td>11,000</td><td>10,000</td></tr></table><p class=\"f\">Oni are ferocious lesser spirits who use their awesome strength and magical abilities to dominate and terrorize the regions they inhabit.</p><p>The common oni stands 7 to 8 feet tall, resembling a thickly-muscled humanoid whose arms and legs are covered with coarse hair. Their hands end in dirty, thick talons, and hooked toenails grow from their wide feet. Their skin is normally red, but other colors have been noted, including green, black, orange, and purple. Blue-skinned oni also exist, but these are more commonly known as <a href=\"/appendix/ogre\">ogre magi</a>, because they have as much in common with the western <a href=\"/appendix/ogre\">ogre</a> as they do they with eastern oni.</p><p>The features of the common oni are fearsome to behold. They have from one to three bulging eyes and broad, pointed ears. One or two thick horns may sprout from their foreheads. Many oni wear shoulder-length hair - usually silver, black, or green - which sometimes is tied in long braids that drape down their backs. Long golden or ivory fangs line their mouths.</p><p>An oni's garb imitates the clothing of the local human population. If an oni band dwells near a military outpost, the lesser spirits usually wear armor pieces, including metallic arm and leg bands and even military insignia that have been taken from murdered soldiers. If an oni band lives near a poor farming community, they usually don peasant smocks and sandals. In any case, an oni's equipment and clothing is always more ragged and filthy than that of his human counterpart.</p><p>Common oni can speak the language of their kind, as well as the languages of <a href=\"/appendix/tengu\">tengu</a>, <a href=\"/appendix/bakemono\">bakemono</a>, <a href=\"/appendix/hengeyok\">hengeyokai</a>, and the local human population. Their voices are deep, resonant, and very loud. An oni's snore rumbles like thunder, while its laugh is powerful enough to shake the leaves from the trees.</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Combat:</b> Most common oni are bloodthirsty and cruel. Not only do they attack for food, but also for the sheer delight of hurting and bullying other creatures. The common oni usually fights with a pair of two-handed swords, one in each hand, but the creature will use other large weapons if available. It also can make slashing attacks with its powerful claws.</p><p>The common oni can <i>polymorph self</i> three times per day, <i>fly</i> three times per day, <i>become invisible</i> two times per day, use <i>cloud trapeze</i> (for themselves only) once per day, and <i>cause fear</i> at will. A few common oni (5%) can spew a column of molten copper at a target up to 10 feet away (make a normal attack roll), causing 4-24 (4d6) hit points of damage. The oni can make one copperspitting attack each day.</p><p>Common oni frequently command lesser creatures such as bakemono, <a href=\"/appendix/goblirat\">goblin rats</a>, and <a href=\"/appendix/gaki\">jiki-niku-gaki</a>. When common oni are encountered, there is a 10% chance that they are accompanied by 2-20 (2d10) of these creatures. (To randomly determine the type of creatures accompanying oni, roll 1d6; 1-3 = goblin rats, 4-5 = bakemono, 6 = jiki-niku-gaki.) In the oni lair, 4-40 (4d10) bakemono or goblin rats are always present (50% chance of each), attending the court of the more powerful oni.</p><p>A hungry or enraged oni typically attacks by charging its opponent, slashing with its weapons or claws like an uncontrollable beast. However, oni bands are capable of more subtle strategies, particularly when ambushing travelers or other unsuspecting prey. For instance, one oni may use <i>polymorph</i> to become a friendly-looking farmer, who engages a traveler in conversation. Meanwhile, other members of the oni band may <i>become invisible</i>, and attack the traveler from behind. If a battle turns against an oni band, one of the lesser spirits may use its <i>cloud trapeze</i> ability, escaping to rally goblin rats or other reinforcements.</p><p>Although oni have little concern for other creatures, they do have a sense of honor and pride, and resent being implicated in crimes they did not commit. For instance, the tale is told of a yakuza gang who convinced a village that an oni had committed certain crimes. In truth, the yakuza themselves were responsible. When the villagers began to hunt the oni, it became enraged, vowing to seek out and destroy the yakuza. (The oni enjoyed its notoriety as the scourge of the countryside, but it was not about to accept the blame for the yakuza gang's actions.) The oni made peace with a group of sympathetic humans, who helped the lesser spirit track down the yakuza. Following the yakuza's defeat, the oni honorably parted company with the humans. Then it resumed its evil ways.</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Habitat/Society:</b> Habitat/Society: The creation of the oni remains a matter of speculation. Most scholars believe that oni originate from the corrupted spirits of evil humans. Others believe the Celestial Bureaucracy created oni to test the diligence of Kara-Tur's more noble inhabitants, as well as to maintain the balance between good and evil. Regardless of their origin, oni persist throughout Kara-Tur, thriving in most of the world's temperate lands.</p><p>Oni usually dwell in desolate and forbidding places, such as rocky mountain regions, deserted ruins, and other sites commonly considered to be haunted. They also may take up residence along a lonely highway near a shrine or gate, harassing all who pass by. Occasionally, an oni may live within a city, hiding in vacant buildings or in the shadows of the city's most destitute streets.</p><p>In rare instances, one of these vicious spirits may rule a small village of humans, and live within the village. This powerful oni may use its <i>polymorph</i> ability to disguise itself as a human tyrant. If it is especially arrogant, it may operate openly.</p><p>An oni band may comprise up to 100 members. Decisions are made collectively by the largest and wisest oni. Females are as powerful as males, fighting with equal prowess and sharing in the command. Male oni have been known to take humans for brides.</p><p>Common oni enjoy music and dance. Occasionally they can be found playing red and blue flutes, singing and stomping for hours on end. Such celebrations often follow an oni victory in battle or the discovery of a luxurious treasure. Interrupting an oni musical performance is guaranteed to infuriate them.</p><p>Oni covet treasure of all types. Typically, they bury valuables in sturdy iron chests near their lairs. Some oni swallow their treasure items, keeping them safe inside their stomachs.</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Ecology:</b> Oni have vast appetites and eat all kinds of game and domestic animals. They're especially fond of cattle, deer, sheep, and large birds. Human or humanoid flesh also has been known to end up in their stomachs. According to legend, a thirsty oni once drank an entire lake in one sitting; when made to laugh, the oni coughed up the water and refilled the lake.</p><p>In addition to bakemono, goblin rats, and gaki, oni will associate with other evil creatures and humanoids, provided such associations promise to benefit the oni. Oni are fond of black animals such as ravens, black snakes, and black cats, and will often pause to admire and speak with them.</p><p>An island inhabited entirely by oni is rumored to exist somewhere in the middle of the Celestial Sea. No human explorer has ever visited the island - at least, none has returned from such a visit. The island is said to be the home of elderly oni who have grown weary and wish to live out their days in peace. Towering mountains of black diamond, rivers of molten silver, and beaches of crimson sand grace the isle. A high iron gate rings the place completely. Thousands of tiny black oni, each no more than a foot tall, guard the island against intruders. In spite of their size, these tiny oni are said to be as powerful as their larger counterparts.</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Go-Zu Oni</b></p>  <p class=\"ni\">Go-zu oni are the most powerful type of oni. Unlike common oni, who are masterless, the go-zu oni are soldiers of the Celestial Bureaucracy. They serve their commanders faithfully and loyally.</p><p>Go-zu oni resemble common oni, but they are larger, and their bodies are thicker. Their skin is usually dark orange, gray, or deep purple. They have the heads of bulls, with large snouts, small ears, and two long horns. Go-zu oni wear ornate robes and polished armor, which is appropriate to their position as servants of the Celestial Emperor. They speak all human languages, along with the languages of tengu, oni, bakemono, all animals, and the Celestial Court.</p><p>Go-zu oni fight with two-handed swords, spears, naginata, halberds, and tridents. In combat, they can make two attacks with a weapon or with their hands. They also can make a single goring attack with their horns. They can <i>polymorph self</i>, <i>cause fear</i>, <i>become invisible</i>, <i>fly</i>, and cast <i>fire shuriken</i> at will. Twice per day, they can use <i>cloud trapeze</i> (for themselves only). They automatically can detect invisible objects and creatures. Their strength equals that of a <a href=\"/appendix/gianhill\">hill giant</a>, and they regenerate 3 hit points per round.</p><p>Along with the me-zu oni, the go-zu oni form the bulk of the Celestial Emperor's army in times of trouble and insurrection. They also oversee the lands of the dead and serve as escorts to these lands for the reluctant departed. Go-zu oni have no permanent lairs in the Prime Material Plane; they make their homes in the Celestial Court.</p><p></p><p class=\"f\"><b>Me-Zu Oni</b></p>  <p class=\"ni\">Like the go-zu oni, me-zu oni are servants and soldiers of the Celestial Emperor. The me-zu oni hold higher positions in the army, however, and command the go-zu oni. When encountered, the me-zu oni are always on a specific mission assigned by the Celestial Bureaucracy. They will not tolerate interference from humans or other lesser creatures.</p><p>Me-zu oni resemble go-zu oni, but are larger, and have the heads of horses. They also lack horns. Me-zu oni can speak and understand any language.</p><p>In addition to the weapons used by the go-zu oni, me-zu oni may use whips and lassos to attack their opponents. They can <i>polymorph self</i>, <i>become invisible</i>, <i>cause fear</i>, and <i>fly</i> at will. They can become <i>ethereal</i> and <i>astral</i> three times per day each, and can use <i>cloud trapeze</i> (for themselves only) three times per day. They have the spell casting ability of 10th-level wu jen; their most common spells include <i>fiery eyes</i>, <i>melt</i>, <i>fire shuriken</i>, <i>whip</i>, <i>animate fire</i>, <i>fire ruin</i>, <i>hold person</i>, <i>dancing blade</i>, <i>polymorph other</i>, <i>wall of fire</i>, <i>creeping darkness</i>, and <i>fire breath</i>. They boast sight abilities equaling the <i>true seeing</i> spell, which are in effect at all times. Their Strength equals that of a <a href=\"/appendix/gianston\">stone giant</a>, and they can regenerate 3 hit points per round.</p>\n","images":["<img src=\"grf/kt.gif\" width=\"150\" height=\"75\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Kara-Tur (Forgotten Realms)\" title=\"Kara-Tur (Forgotten Realms)\" align=\"right\">","<img src=\"img/oni.gif\" alt=\"Oni\" title=\"Oni\" border=\"0\" width=\"300\" height=\"360\" style=\"text-align:right;\" align=\"right\">","<img src=\"grf/add2_01.gif\" width=\"200\" height=\"56\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Advanced Dungeons & Dragons 2nd Edition\">"],"setting":"Kara-Tur (Forgotten Realms)","statblock":{"Common Oni":{"Activity Cycle":"Any","Alignment":"Lawful evil","Armor Class":"4","Climate/Terrain":"Temperate mountains, hills, plains, forests, and subterranean","Damage/Attack":"3-10/3-10","Diet":"Carnivore","Frequency":"Rare","Hit Dice":"8","Intelligence":"Average (8-10)","Magic Resistance":"Nil","Morale":"Elite (13)","Movement":"9","No. Appearing":"1-100","No. of Attacks":"2","Organization":"Solitary or band","Size":"L (7-8' tall)","Special Attacks":"Spells","Special Defenses":"Nil","THAC0":"13","Treasure":"A","XP Value":"1,400"},"Go-Zu-Oni":{"Activity Cycle":"Any","Alignment":"Lawful neutral","Armor Class":"0","Climate/Terrain":"Any land","Damage/Attack":"6-16/6-16/1-10","Diet":"Carnivore","Frequency":"Very rare","Hit Dice":"12+8","Intelligence":"High (13-14)","Magic Resistance":"20%","Morale":"Champion (15)","Movement":"9","No. Appearing":"1-20","No. of Attacks":"3","Organization":"Solitary or band","Size":"L (8-9' tall)","Special Attacks":"See below","Special Defenses":"Regeneration","THAC0":"9","Treasure":"S","XP Value":"11,000"},"Me-Zu-Oni":{"Activity Cycle":"Any","Alignment":"Lawful neutral","Armor Class":"2","Climate/Terrain":"Any land","Damage/Attack":"3-18/3-18","Diet":"Carnivore","Frequency":"Very rare","Hit Dice":"10+5","Intelligence":"High (13-14)","Magic Resistance":"40%","Morale":"Elite (14)","Movement":"12","No. Appearing":"1-20","No. of Attacks":"2","Organization":"Solitary or band","Size":"L (9'+ tall)","Special Attacks":"See below","Special Defenses":"Regeneration","THAC0":"11","Treasure":"S","XP Value":"10,000"}},"title":"Oni"},"sources":["2116"],"statblock_names":[],"title":"Oni","prev_key":"onco","next_key":"oortling","monster_path":"/appendix/oni"}},"staticQueryHashes":[],"slicesMap":{}}
