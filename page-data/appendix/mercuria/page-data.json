While the powers listed above are the most common, some aarakocra have different or additional powers.</p><p class=\"f\">A race of intelligent, birdlike creatures living in the deepest deserts of Athas, the rare Athasian <a href=\"/appendix/aarakocr\">aarakocra</a> spends its time soaring on thermals in search of food.</p><p>The aarakocra is 7 to 8 feet tall with a wingspan of 20 feet or more. Because of its large wingspan, an aarakocra can carry as much as 75% of its own body weight and still fly easily. An aarakocra can fly a short distance carrying a burden equaling 125% of its own body weight. The average body weight of a full grown male is 100 pounds and a female is 85 pounds.</p><p>Each wing has a &ldquo;hand&rdquo; at its midpoint, consisting of three fingers and an opposable thumb. The fourth finger forms the rigid leading edge of the wing. In flight the hands cannot be used, but on the ground the aarakocra can use its hands almost as a human would. The aarakocra's body is protected by a thin bony plate on the chest, much like a solid rib cage. Talons on its legs can be used as claws and can be retracted to reveal a second set of hands, also with three fingers and an opposable thumb. Except for the chest plate, the entire skeleton is hollow and extremely fragile.</p><p>From a distance, the Athasian aarakocra resembles a huge <a href=\"/appendix/bird\">vulture</a>. Its black eyes, set in the front of the head, provide excellent vision over a long range. The plumage is generally black with a white collar for adult males and black or brown with a smaller white collar for females. Adolescents are a mixture of brown and black. The beak is large and covers most of the head. Plumage begins at the crown of the head and is darker near the head, except for the collar. Athasian aarakocra speak their own language and the languages of vultures and other large birds. Some speak the common tongue (5% to 10% chance depending on how deep in the wastelands a tribe lives).</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Combat:</b> Aarakocra can fight in the air or on the ground. They prefer aerial combat since their bones are too fragile to withstand a solid blow from a human-sized opponent. In combat against creatures on the ground, they prefer to fly over their victim and drop weighted nets. Some aarakocra use darts to harass ground-based opponents.</p><p>If their opponents can fly, the aarakocra generally forgo the use of the net, although large groups sometimes use nets on flying creatures. Normally, aarakocra attack flying creatures with long spears, diving from above and allowing the momentum to carry the spear through the target. Such an attack doubles the damage if the aarakocra have been able to dive at least 50 feet. Only the very largest aarakocra can carry more than one of these spears, they can attack with both at once with no penalty, causing double damage on each strike. All diving attacks are made at +4 and should be treated as a charge attack. All other penalties and restrictions of charge attacks apply.</p><p>The effect of the aarakocra's nets depends on if the opponent is flying at the time it becomes entangled. Creatures on the ground that are hit by a net are entangled and unable to participate in any combat until they make a successful Strength check to get free of the net. Flying creatures hit by a net can no longer fly and immediately begin falling. If they cannot escape the net or use some magical means to arrest the fall, normal falling damage applies.</p><p>Unless victims are entangled in nets, aarakocra are cautious in ground combat. If the aarakocra outnumber their opponents they advance in a straight line and thrust with their spears. If outnumbered, or the opponents are particularly tough, the aarakocra withdraw. Victims entangled in nets are killed or incapacitated for use as food or ransom.</p><p>Athasian aarakocra are mindful of their physical limitations as well as their comparatively low psionic abilities. They do not normally initiate psionic combat. At the first sign of psionic powers from any of their victims, however, all aarakocra that have some ability will use whatever attack and defense modes they can in an attempt to destroy the threat. Large groups of is or more aarakocra may initiate psionic combat if their leaders feel they can win quickly and avoid physical combat.</p><p>In desperation, an aarakocra can attempt to bite an opponent in combat. Because of the unwieldiness of its beak, the aarakocra has a THAC0 of 18 if attacking with this appendage. Further, the birdman causes only 1d2 points of damage with the beak.</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Habitat/Society:</b> Athasian aarakocra live in tribes with 6-20 (2d8+4) members, depending on the prestige of the leader. The largest tribe ever recorded had 50 members. The tribal hunting territory depends on the size of the tribe, usually about 500 square miles for a tribe of 10 members. There are no rigid boundaries between tribes and border disputes are not uncommon.</p><p>Alignments of tribe members are similar to the alignment of the leader. A tribe that has a leader who is neutral good may have neutral good, chaotic good, lawful good, and true neutral members. A predominantly evil tribe does not recognize boundaries with other tribes and treats other tribes as inferior beings to be eliminated.</p><p>Athasian aarakocra aren't happy in enclosed spaces, but they they take refuge in a cave or building if necessary.</p><p>Nonevil tribes live in rocky aeries in the highest peaks they can find. Evil tribes are normally nomadic and use an aerie made by another tribe if they need to remain in an area for a long time, even if they have to evict the tribe that made the nest.</p><p>Aarakocra aren't friendly toward intruders in their territory, especially caravans. They try to extract a toll from the caravan for passage through the desert. Good-aligned tribes allow unhindered passage of caravans that pay a tribute. If someone refuses to pay the tribute, the aarakocra try to capture scouts or outriders from the party and hold them until an even larger tribute is paid. The payment may be either livestock or shiny objects. Aarakocra are smart enough not to be taken in by glass baubles instead of gems, although they cannot tell the difference between the more common gems and the rare ones.</p><p>Evil tribes ask for tribute and often attack a caravan whether it pays or not. Aarakocra always demand shiny objects such as stones. These tribes find humans and demihumans to be quite tasty and prefer them to other food.</p><p>Good-aligned tribes of aarakocra sometimes return a lost traveler to the edge of the desert after first removing any valuables the traveler may be carrying. On very rare occasions a tribe might return a lost group of travelers to the more frequently traveled parts of the desert, again after first taking any valuables as payment.</p><p>The oldest male is the leader of the tribal hunting party and has 4+4 Hit Dice. The oldest female is in charge of the tribal aerie and has 3+3 HD. In tribes that have more than 15 members, the next oldest aarakocra serves as shaman and has 3+3 HD; the shaman completes the triumvirate necessary for proper worship and the summoning of elementals. (Interestingly, no magic-using aarakocra has ever been recorded.) Tribes without a shaman cannot summon <a href=\"/appendix/element1\">air elementals</a>, which is an important part of aarakocra culture.</p><p>The shaman is the leader of the daily sun worship. Aarakocra worship the sun because it provides them with the thermals they need to soar in search of food. The shaman also leads the mystic rituals used to summon an air elemental. Summoning an air elemental is usually done only in preparation for the tribe's most sacred ceremony, the hunt. Small tribes must band together for this ceremony to allow the triumvirate to be formed.</p><p>The ceremony to summon an air elemental must be conducted at dawn and requires the oldest male and female to emit a highpitched keening whistle. The shaman conducts an intricate dance around them, simultaneously chanting an ancient summoning mantra.</p><p>The hunt is the final part of the initiation of adolescent aarakocra to adulthood and often takes the tribe far from their normal teritory. The target is always a <a href=\"/appendix/drakalsi\">silt drake</a>. The hunt is the only time the females leave the relative safety of the nest. Even an evil tribe will not interfere with a tribe on a hunt. An air elemental is often summoned to help find the drake, but never takes part in the actual combat. Although the adult members of the tribe take part in the initial phases of the combat, it is the initiates who deliver the final, killing blows to me drake. Scars from the hunt are considered a mark of pride among all aarakocra.</p><p>The females spend about eight months of the year incubating their eggs. Athasian aarakocra mate for life and a pair normally produces as many as 10 offspring. A female lays one egg a year. Constant incubation is not required because of the high daytime temperatures, so the females can maintain the nest and keep the tribe's treasure in order.</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Ecology:</b> Athasian aarakocra are high on the food chain and have no natural enemies other than <a href=\"/appendix/drakatha\">drakes</a>. Unless evil, aarakocra leave their own territory only to hunt the silt drake and return as soon as possible when the hunt is over. (Evil aarakocra attack others, as noted above.) Aarakocra eggs and hatchlings are sought after by wealthy land owners who wish to use the creatures as scouts and sentries. An egg can bring as much as 10 cp in Tyr's marketplace. Tribes that have had eggs or hatchlings stolen have long memories and sometimes take revenge against the thief at a later date. Captive aarakocra join any tribe they come in contact with.</p><p>Athasian aarakocra have a natural life span of 21-30 years.</p><p></p><br clear=\"all\" style=\"clear:both; height:0;\">\r\n","images":["<img src=\"grf/ds.gif\" width=\"150\" height=\"75\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Dark Sun\" title=\"Dark Sun\" align=\"right\">","<img src=\"img/aarakath.gif\" alt=\"Aarakocra (Athas)\" title=\"Aarakocra (Athas)\" border=\"0\" width=\"300\" height=\"360\" style=\"text-align:right;\" align=\"right\">","<img src=\"grf/add2_01.gif\" width=\"200\" height=\"56\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Advanced Dungeons & Dragons 2nd Edition\">"],"setting":"Dark Sun","statblock":{"Aarakocra (Athas)":{"Activity Cycle":"Day","Alignment":"Any","Armor Class":"7","Climate/Terrain":"Deep desert","Damage/Attack":"1d3/1d3 or by weapon","Diet":"Carnivore","Frequency":"Rare","Hit Dice":"2+2","Intelligence":"Average (8-10)","Magic Resistance":"Nil","Morale":"Steady (11)","Movement":"6, Fl 36 (C)","No. Appearing":"1d10","No. of Attacks":"2","Organization":"Tribal","Size":"M (20'+ wingspan)","Special Attacks":"Nil","Special Defenses":"Nil","THAC0":"17","Treasure":"Varies","XP Value":"65"}},"title":"Aarakocra (Athas)"},"sources":["2433"],"statblock_names":[],"title":"Aarakocra (Athas)","prev_key":"zygraat","next_key":"aarakocr","monster_path":"/appendix/aarakath"}}},"pageContext":{"monster_key":"mercuria","monster_data":{"TSR":["2173","2626"],"fullBody":"  <table cellspacing=\"0\" cellpadding=\"0\"><tr><th>Climate/Terrain:</th><td>Hyper-reality</td></tr><tr><th>Frequency:</th><td>Very rare</td></tr><tr><th>Organization:</th><td>Solitary (family)</td></tr><tr><th>Activity Cycle:</th><td>Any</td></tr><tr><th>Diet:</th><td>Special</td></tr><tr><th>Intelligence:</th><td>Supra-Genius (19-20)</td></tr><tr><th>Treasure:</th><td>None</td></tr><tr><th>Alignment:</th><td>Neutral</td></tr><tr><th>No. Appearing:</th><td>1 [1d6]</td></tr><tr><th>Armor Class:</th><td>-2 [0]</td></tr><tr><th>Movement:</th><td>15 [30]</td></tr><tr><th>Hit Dice:</th><td>14</td></tr><tr><th>THAC0:</th><td>7</td></tr><tr><th>No. of Attacks:</th><td>2</td></tr><tr><th>Damage/Attack:</th><td>1d8+1/1d8+1 [2d8+2/2d8+2]</td></tr><tr><th>Special Attacks:</th><td>Borrow form, mental blast [wish]</td></tr><tr><th>Special Defenses:</th><td>Nil [+1 magical weapon or better to hit, regeneration]</td></tr><tr><th>Magic Resistance:</th><td>20%</td></tr><tr><th>Size:</th><td>M (5-6'tall)</td></tr><tr><th>Morale:</th><td>Steady (11-12)</td></tr><tr><th>XP Value:</th><td>9,000 [26,000]</td></tr></table><p class=\"f\">[Items in brackets reflect hyper-reality. The XP award becomes 22,000 in hyper-reality if the mercurial is wearing the <i>manacles of lesser reality</i>.]</p><p class=\"f\">Some bloods know that the reality every berk is used to isn't the only reality. There're realities that have less substance, and there're realities that're more intense, <i>more real</i>, than the multiverse most bodies are familiar with. These different levels of reality have their own rules, characteristics, and inhabitants, though these rarely have any affect on the multiverse at large.</p><p> One of these higher realities (called <i>hyper-realities</i> by bloods who know the music) occupies a corner of Mount Celestia, where the realm of Beldaari shines with an intensity that's blinding to the lesser beings of the multiverse. In this realm, an unnamed power of pure thought contemplates ideas and concepts that are unfathomable to even the greatest sages of normal reality. This power is served by mercurials, an intelligent race of human-like beings attuned to the rules of hyper-reality.</p><p>In his natural form, a mercurial is indistinguishable from a normal human. He's of normal human height and build, has flesh tones in the normal range, and even his hair color falls within hues that are natural on a hundred different Prime worlds. In fact, the only difference that marks a mercurial from a human is his eyes, which are orbs of liquid metal, either fiery gold, scintillating silver, or shifting bronze.</p><p>Where a mercurial truly differs from a human is in his ability to shed his skin and bones; his inner flesh and organs can exist apart from the rest of his body. In Beldaari, the mercurial steps out of his skin to physically and symbolically leave behind his corporeal anchor and commune with his god. It's their physiological attempt at leaving behind the things of the flesh to get closer to pure, unencumbered thought.</p><p>Mercurials can vocalize any language (their mental abilities allowing them to learn a new language by plucking it right out of someone's mind), but they prefer to simply project and receive thoughts.</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Combat:</b> Most mercurials are pacifists, refusing to fight even to defend themselves. If threatened, a mercurial can <i>wish</i> himself to safety and avoid the fight. When forced into battle, a mercurial can strike with both fists in a single round, delivering damage with each one. If a mercurial has shed his skin and bones, each his inner flesh and outer flesh have the creature's total hit points. Whiie the inner flesh can be damaged, it continues to regenerate (see below) until the outer flesh and bones are destroyed (which completely kills the mercurial).</p><p><i>Borrow Form</i> - Not only can a mercurial shed his skin and bones, he can then merge his inner flesh and organs with another being. Most mercurials &ldquo;borrow&rdquo; another's form to experience life through that being's senses. They never borrow a form without permission, and they never stay long enough to cause serious harm. A host gets a saving throw vs. petrification to resist the merge. If the merge is successful, the host loses Id4 points of Constitution per turn and must make a saving throw vs. petrification when the mercurial sheds the host's form. A successful saving throw indicates that the host will recover the lost Constitution points at a rate of one point per day. A failure indicates that the reduction in Constitution is permanent (unless restored through magical means). Any host reduced to zero Constitution points dies.</p><p><i>Mental Blast</i> - If necessary, a mercurial can project a powerful blast of pure thought at an enemy. This mental blast inflicts 1d12+2 points of damage on a target (who can save vs. rod for half damage).</p><p><i>Wish</i> - In hyper-reality, a mercurial's every thought can become real. This is reflected in their ability to mentally &ldquo;cast&rdquo; a <i>wish</i> spell once per turn.</p><p><i>Immunity to Normal Weapons</i> - In hyper-reality, a mercurial can be damaged only by weapons with a +1 enchantment or better. Normal weapons inflict no damage.</p><p><i>Regeneration</i> - A mercurial's inner flesh and organs regenerate damage at a rate of 3 hit points per round. If merged with his skin and bones, the entire mercurial heals in this manner. If the skin and bones (or the merged mercurial) are reduced to 0 hit points, the mercurial dies.</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Habitat/Society:</b> Mercurials live in the fourth level of reality, a state of existence called hyper-reality. In hyper-reality, everything has more vitality: Colors are brighter, scents are stronger, sounds are more intense, and emotions are more stirring. To reflect this, all damage rolls and movement rates are doubled; range, duration, effect, and area of effect of all spells are doubled; and experience points are calculated at double the normal rate.</p><p>Beldaari, the realm of the mercurials, is a huge forest specifically designed by its power to be a refuge of peace and quiet where all its inhabitants can contemplate and reflect on pure thoughts. The mercurials contemplate separately, but come together in family units whenever they return to their skin and bones. In Beldaari, mercurials are usually encountered while they are contemplating some great thought or another, resting beside a river or beneath the shade of a tree.</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Ecology:</b> While mercurials can eat most vegetables and meats, they usually draw nourishment by shedding their bodies and communing with the mental force of their god.</p><p></p><br clear=\"all\" style=\"clear:both; height:0;\">\r\n","images":["<img src=\"grf/ps.gif\" width=\"150\" height=\"75\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Planescape\" title=\"Planescape\" align=\"right\">","<img src=\"img/mercuria.gif\" alt=\"Mercurial\" title=\"Mercurial\" border=\"0\" width=\"300\" height=\"360\" style=\"text-align:right;\" align=\"right\">","<img src=\"grf/add2_01.gif\" width=\"200\" height=\"56\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Advanced Dungeons & Dragons 2nd Edition\">"],"setting":"Planescape","statblock":{"Mercurial":{"Activity Cycle":"Any","Alignment":"Neutral","Armor Class":"-2 [0]","Climate/Terrain":"Hyper-reality","Damage/Attack":"1d8+1/1d8+1 [2d8+2/2d8+2]","Diet":"Special","Frequency":"Very rare","Hit Dice":"14","Intelligence":"Supra-Genius (19-20)","Magic Resistance":"20%","Morale":"Steady (11-12)","Movement":"15 [30]","No. Appearing":"1 [1d6]","No. of Attacks":"2","Organization":"Solitary (family)","Size":"M (5-6'tall)","Special Attacks":"Borrow form, mental blast [wish]","Special Defenses":"Nil [+1 magical weapon or better to hit, regeneration]","THAC0":"7","Treasure":"None","XP Value":"9,000 [26,000]"}},"title":"Mercurial"},"sources":["2173","2626"],"statblock_names":[],"title":"Mercurial","prev_key":"mercslim","next_key":"merhorse","monster_path":"/appendix/mercuria"}},"staticQueryHashes":[],"slicesMap":{}}
