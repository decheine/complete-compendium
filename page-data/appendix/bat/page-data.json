While the powers listed above are the most common, some aarakocra have different or additional powers.</p><p class=\"f\">A race of intelligent, birdlike creatures living in the deepest deserts of Athas, the rare Athasian <a href=\"/appendix/aarakocr\">aarakocra</a> spends its time soaring on thermals in search of food.</p><p>The aarakocra is 7 to 8 feet tall with a wingspan of 20 feet or more. Because of its large wingspan, an aarakocra can carry as much as 75% of its own body weight and still fly easily. An aarakocra can fly a short distance carrying a burden equaling 125% of its own body weight. The average body weight of a full grown male is 100 pounds and a female is 85 pounds.</p><p>Each wing has a &ldquo;hand&rdquo; at its midpoint, consisting of three fingers and an opposable thumb. The fourth finger forms the rigid leading edge of the wing. In flight the hands cannot be used, but on the ground the aarakocra can use its hands almost as a human would. The aarakocra's body is protected by a thin bony plate on the chest, much like a solid rib cage. Talons on its legs can be used as claws and can be retracted to reveal a second set of hands, also with three fingers and an opposable thumb. Except for the chest plate, the entire skeleton is hollow and extremely fragile.</p><p>From a distance, the Athasian aarakocra resembles a huge <a href=\"/appendix/bird\">vulture</a>. Its black eyes, set in the front of the head, provide excellent vision over a long range. The plumage is generally black with a white collar for adult males and black or brown with a smaller white collar for females. Adolescents are a mixture of brown and black. The beak is large and covers most of the head. Plumage begins at the crown of the head and is darker near the head, except for the collar. Athasian aarakocra speak their own language and the languages of vultures and other large birds. Some speak the common tongue (5% to 10% chance depending on how deep in the wastelands a tribe lives).</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Combat:</b> Aarakocra can fight in the air or on the ground. They prefer aerial combat since their bones are too fragile to withstand a solid blow from a human-sized opponent. In combat against creatures on the ground, they prefer to fly over their victim and drop weighted nets. Some aarakocra use darts to harass ground-based opponents.</p><p>If their opponents can fly, the aarakocra generally forgo the use of the net, although large groups sometimes use nets on flying creatures. Normally, aarakocra attack flying creatures with long spears, diving from above and allowing the momentum to carry the spear through the target. Such an attack doubles the damage if the aarakocra have been able to dive at least 50 feet. Only the very largest aarakocra can carry more than one of these spears, they can attack with both at once with no penalty, causing double damage on each strike. All diving attacks are made at +4 and should be treated as a charge attack. All other penalties and restrictions of charge attacks apply.</p><p>The effect of the aarakocra's nets depends on if the opponent is flying at the time it becomes entangled. Creatures on the ground that are hit by a net are entangled and unable to participate in any combat until they make a successful Strength check to get free of the net. Flying creatures hit by a net can no longer fly and immediately begin falling. If they cannot escape the net or use some magical means to arrest the fall, normal falling damage applies.</p><p>Unless victims are entangled in nets, aarakocra are cautious in ground combat. If the aarakocra outnumber their opponents they advance in a straight line and thrust with their spears. If outnumbered, or the opponents are particularly tough, the aarakocra withdraw. Victims entangled in nets are killed or incapacitated for use as food or ransom.</p><p>Athasian aarakocra are mindful of their physical limitations as well as their comparatively low psionic abilities. They do not normally initiate psionic combat. At the first sign of psionic powers from any of their victims, however, all aarakocra that have some ability will use whatever attack and defense modes they can in an attempt to destroy the threat. Large groups of is or more aarakocra may initiate psionic combat if their leaders feel they can win quickly and avoid physical combat.</p><p>In desperation, an aarakocra can attempt to bite an opponent in combat. Because of the unwieldiness of its beak, the aarakocra has a THAC0 of 18 if attacking with this appendage. Further, the birdman causes only 1d2 points of damage with the beak.</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Habitat/Society:</b> Athasian aarakocra live in tribes with 6-20 (2d8+4) members, depending on the prestige of the leader. The largest tribe ever recorded had 50 members. The tribal hunting territory depends on the size of the tribe, usually about 500 square miles for a tribe of 10 members. There are no rigid boundaries between tribes and border disputes are not uncommon.</p><p>Alignments of tribe members are similar to the alignment of the leader. A tribe that has a leader who is neutral good may have neutral good, chaotic good, lawful good, and true neutral members. A predominantly evil tribe does not recognize boundaries with other tribes and treats other tribes as inferior beings to be eliminated.</p><p>Athasian aarakocra aren't happy in enclosed spaces, but they they take refuge in a cave or building if necessary.</p><p>Nonevil tribes live in rocky aeries in the highest peaks they can find. Evil tribes are normally nomadic and use an aerie made by another tribe if they need to remain in an area for a long time, even if they have to evict the tribe that made the nest.</p><p>Aarakocra aren't friendly toward intruders in their territory, especially caravans. They try to extract a toll from the caravan for passage through the desert. Good-aligned tribes allow unhindered passage of caravans that pay a tribute. If someone refuses to pay the tribute, the aarakocra try to capture scouts or outriders from the party and hold them until an even larger tribute is paid. The payment may be either livestock or shiny objects. Aarakocra are smart enough not to be taken in by glass baubles instead of gems, although they cannot tell the difference between the more common gems and the rare ones.</p><p>Evil tribes ask for tribute and often attack a caravan whether it pays or not. Aarakocra always demand shiny objects such as stones. These tribes find humans and demihumans to be quite tasty and prefer them to other food.</p><p>Good-aligned tribes of aarakocra sometimes return a lost traveler to the edge of the desert after first removing any valuables the traveler may be carrying. On very rare occasions a tribe might return a lost group of travelers to the more frequently traveled parts of the desert, again after first taking any valuables as payment.</p><p>The oldest male is the leader of the tribal hunting party and has 4+4 Hit Dice. The oldest female is in charge of the tribal aerie and has 3+3 HD. In tribes that have more than 15 members, the next oldest aarakocra serves as shaman and has 3+3 HD; the shaman completes the triumvirate necessary for proper worship and the summoning of elementals. (Interestingly, no magic-using aarakocra has ever been recorded.) Tribes without a shaman cannot summon <a href=\"/appendix/element1\">air elementals</a>, which is an important part of aarakocra culture.</p><p>The shaman is the leader of the daily sun worship. Aarakocra worship the sun because it provides them with the thermals they need to soar in search of food. The shaman also leads the mystic rituals used to summon an air elemental. Summoning an air elemental is usually done only in preparation for the tribe's most sacred ceremony, the hunt. Small tribes must band together for this ceremony to allow the triumvirate to be formed.</p><p>The ceremony to summon an air elemental must be conducted at dawn and requires the oldest male and female to emit a highpitched keening whistle. The shaman conducts an intricate dance around them, simultaneously chanting an ancient summoning mantra.</p><p>The hunt is the final part of the initiation of adolescent aarakocra to adulthood and often takes the tribe far from their normal teritory. The target is always a <a href=\"/appendix/drakalsi\">silt drake</a>. The hunt is the only time the females leave the relative safety of the nest. Even an evil tribe will not interfere with a tribe on a hunt. An air elemental is often summoned to help find the drake, but never takes part in the actual combat. Although the adult members of the tribe take part in the initial phases of the combat, it is the initiates who deliver the final, killing blows to me drake. Scars from the hunt are considered a mark of pride among all aarakocra.</p><p>The females spend about eight months of the year incubating their eggs. Athasian aarakocra mate for life and a pair normally produces as many as 10 offspring. A female lays one egg a year. Constant incubation is not required because of the high daytime temperatures, so the females can maintain the nest and keep the tribe's treasure in order.</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Ecology:</b> Athasian aarakocra are high on the food chain and have no natural enemies other than <a href=\"/appendix/drakatha\">drakes</a>. Unless evil, aarakocra leave their own territory only to hunt the silt drake and return as soon as possible when the hunt is over. (Evil aarakocra attack others, as noted above.) Aarakocra eggs and hatchlings are sought after by wealthy land owners who wish to use the creatures as scouts and sentries. An egg can bring as much as 10 cp in Tyr's marketplace. Tribes that have had eggs or hatchlings stolen have long memories and sometimes take revenge against the thief at a later date. Captive aarakocra join any tribe they come in contact with.</p><p>Athasian aarakocra have a natural life span of 21-30 years.</p><p></p><br clear=\"all\" style=\"clear:both; height:0;\">\r\n","images":["<img src=\"grf/ds.gif\" width=\"150\" height=\"75\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Dark Sun\" title=\"Dark Sun\" align=\"right\">","<img src=\"img/aarakath.gif\" alt=\"Aarakocra (Athas)\" title=\"Aarakocra (Athas)\" border=\"0\" width=\"300\" height=\"360\" style=\"text-align:right;\" align=\"right\">","<img src=\"grf/add2_01.gif\" width=\"200\" height=\"56\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Advanced Dungeons & Dragons 2nd Edition\">"],"setting":"Dark Sun","statblock":{"Aarakocra (Athas)":{"Activity Cycle":"Day","Alignment":"Any","Armor Class":"7","Climate/Terrain":"Deep desert","Damage/Attack":"1d3/1d3 or by weapon","Diet":"Carnivore","Frequency":"Rare","Hit Dice":"2+2","Intelligence":"Average (8-10)","Magic Resistance":"Nil","Morale":"Steady (11)","Movement":"6, Fl 36 (C)","No. Appearing":"1d10","No. of Attacks":"2","Organization":"Tribal","Size":"M (20'+ wingspan)","Special Attacks":"Nil","Special Defenses":"Nil","THAC0":"17","Treasure":"Varies","XP Value":"65"}},"title":"Aarakocra (Athas)"},"sources":["2433"],"statblock_names":[],"title":"Aarakocra (Athas)","prev_key":"zygraat","next_key":"aarakocr","monster_path":"/appendix/aarakath"}}},"pageContext":{"monster_key":"bat","monster_data":{"TSR":["2140","2102"],"fullBody":"  <table cellspacing=\"0\" cellpadding=\"0\"><tr class=\"bk\"><th> </th><th class=\"cn\">Common</th><th class=\"cn\">Large</th><th class=\"cn\">Huge</th><th class=\"cn\">Azmyth</th><th class=\"cn\">Night Hunter</th><th class=\"cn\">Sinister</th></tr><tr><th>Climate/Terrain:</th><td>Any land</td><td>Any land</td><td>Warm caves</td><td>Any land</td><td>Any land</td><td>Any land</td></tr><tr><th>Frequency:</th><td>Common</td><td>Uncommon</td><td>Rare</td><td>Rare</td><td>Uncommon</td><td>Rare</td></tr><tr><th>Organization:</th><td>Swarm</td><td>Flock</td><td>Flock</td><td>Solitary</td><td>Pack</td><td>Band</td></tr><tr><th>Activity Cycle:</th><td>Night</td><td>Night</td><td>Night</td><td>Any</td><td>Night/any</td><td>Any</td></tr><tr><th>Diet:</th><td>Omnivore</td><td>Omnivore</td><td>Omnivore</td><td>Omnivore</td><td>Carnivore</td><td>Omnivore</td></tr><tr><th>Intelligence:</th><td>Animal (1)</td><td>Animal (1)</td><td>Low (5-7)</td><td>High (13-14)</td><td>Average to High (8-14)</td><td>Average to Except.

While ordinary bats are annoying but harmless, larger varieties can be quite deadly.</p><p>With almost 2,000 different species of bats known, one can find wingspans from less than two inches across to 15 feet or more. The small body of the ordinary bat resembles a mouse, while the wings are formed from extra skin stretched across its fore limbs. The larger bats are scaled up but otherwise similar in appearance.</p><p>Despite the common belief that bats are blind, nearly all known species have rather good eyesight. In the dark, however, they do not rely on their visual acuity, but navigate instead by echo-location. By emitting a high-pitched squeal and listening for it to bounce back to them, they can <q>see</q> their surroundings by this natural form of sonar.</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Combat:</b> Ordinary bats attack only if cornered and left with no other option. If startled, bats tend to become frightened and confused. This causes them to swarm around and often fly into things. The typical bat swarm ends up putting out torches (1% chance per bat encountered per round), confusing spell casting (Wisdom roll required to cast spells), inhibiting combatants' ability to wield weapons (by a -2 THAC0 penalty), and otherwise getting in the way. Under ideal flying conditions, a bat's Armor Class rating rises from 8 to 4.</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Habitat/Society:</b> While bats are found almost anywhere, they prefer warm and humid climes. Some species hibernate during the cold season and a few are know to migrate. Bats live in caves, dark buildings, or damp crevices, hanging by their toes during the day, and leaving at dusk to feed during the night. In large, isolated caverns there may be thousands of bats.</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Ecology:</b> Most bats eat fruit or insects, though some include small animals or fish in their diets. The rare vampire bat travels at night to drink the warm blood of living mammals, but its victims are rarely humans or demihumans. Care must be taken not to confuse the vampire bat with the true <a href=\"/appendix/vampire\">vampire</a> in this regard. <a href=\"/appendix/rotgrub\">Rot grubs</a> and <a href=\"/appendix/carrcraw\">carrion crawlers</a> are among the few creatures known to live in the guano on the floor of large bat-infested caverns, making any expeditions into such caves dangerous indeed. If the noxious odor from the guano is not enough to subdue the hardiest of adventurers (a single Constitution check to stay conscious), these crawling denizens are.</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Large Bat</b></p>  <p class=\"ni\">These creatures are large versions of the carnivorous variety of the ordinary bat with 3-foot-long bodies and 5- to 6-foot-long wingspans. They dwell in dark caverns, usually underground, and depend on their sonar in flight to compensate for their poor eyesight. Only 10% of giant bats are of the more powerful 1 Hit Die variety.</p><p>Extremely maneuverable in flight, large bats gain an Armor Class bonus of +3 when an opponent with a Dexterity of 13 or less fires a missile weapon at it. The creature must land (usually on its victim) to attack with its bite. The typical example of this species inflicts 1d2 points of damage with its teeth while the larger does 1d4 points of damage. Anyone bitten by a large bat has a 1% chance per point of damage done to contract rabies.</p><p>When rabies is contracted, there is a 1d4+6 day incubation period. Once this period has ended, the victim has 10 days to live. The victim cannot drink or eat anything and is overly irritable. Anything from loud noises to being awakened at night can set the victim off (the DM determines the temper triggers). If temper flares, the victim must roll a Wisdom check. If the check fails, the rabid person attacks until he is killed or knocked unconscious. When a character contracts rabies, he or she dies from the infliction, unless cured by a <i>wish</i>, <i>alter reality</i>, <i>limited wish</i>, <i>cure disease</i>, or similar spell.</p><p></p><p class=\"f\"><b>Huge Bat (Mobat)</b></p>  <p class=\"ni\">Mobats prefer warm-blooded prey that they bite to death with their fangs. They have a dim and evil intelligence that gives them a desire for shiny objects. Because the typical mobat has a wingspan of 12 to 16 feet, they must have large areas to serve as flight runways.</p><p>Because Mobats' flight is so rapid and silent, their victims suffer a -3 penalty to their surprise rolls. They can also give a piercing screech that causes such great pain that victims seek to cover their ears rather than fight, unless a saving throw versus paralyzation is successful. This screech is always used if the prey resists and it is effective in a 20-foot radius about the mobat. Note that mobile mobats have an Armor Class of 2. Under crowded flying conditions, their Armor Class suffers and raises to 7. When not in flight, mobats have an Armor Class of 10.</p><p></p><p class=\"f\"><b>Azmyth</b></p>  <p class=\"ni\">Azmyths live on flowers, small plants, and insects. They are solitary wanderers, though they do have <q>favorite haunts</q> to which they return. They often form partnerships with humanoids for mutual benefit, sometimes forming loyal friendships in the process. Azmyths have been known to accompany creatures for their entire lives, and then accompany the creatures' offspring. The life span of azmyths are presently unknown but is believed to be over 100 years. They are not familiars as wizards understand the term; no direct control can be exercised over one, except by spells.</p><p>Azmyths have crested heads and bearded chins, white, pupil-less eyes, and leathery gray, mauve, or emerald green skin. They emit shrill squeaks of alarm or rage, and endearing, liquid chuckles of delight or amusement. They communicate by <i>telepathy</i> that has a range of 60 feet, and have infravision to 90 feet. They can <i>know alignment</i> three times per day, <i>become invisible</i> (self only for six rounds or less, ending when the azmyth makes a successful attack) once per day, and <i>create silence 15' radius</i>, centered on themselves, once per day.</p><p>In combat, the azmyth bites for 1 point of damage and stabs with its powerful needle-sharp tails for 1d2 points. Twice per day, an azmyth can unleash a shocking grasp attack, transmitting 1d8+6 points of electrical damage through any direct physical contact with another creature. This attack can be combined with a physical attack for cumulative damage.</p><p></p><p class=\"f\"><b>Night Hunter</b></p>  <p class=\"ni\">This species, know as dragazhar, is named after the adventurer who first domesticated one, long ago.</p><p>Nocturnal on the surface, it is active anytime in the gloom of the underworld. It eats carrion if it must, but usually hunts small beasts. Desperate dragazhar are known to attack livestock, drow, or humans.</p><p>Night hunters swoop down to bite prey (1d4), rake with their wing claws (1d2 each), and slash (1d6) or stab (3d4) with their dexterous, triangular-shaped, razor sharp tails. They stalk their prey, flying low and dodging behind hillocks, ridges, trees, or stalactites, to attack from ambush. They have infravision to a distance of 120 feet, but rarely surprise opponents, since they emit echoing, loon-like screams when excited.</p><p>Night hunter lairs usually contain over 30 creatures. They typically live in double-ended caves, or above ground in tall, dense woods. Night hunters do not tarry to eat where they feel endangered, so their lairs often contain treasure fallen from prey carried there. Night hunters roost head-down when sleeping. They are velvet in hue, even to their claws, and have violet, orange, or red eyes.</p><p></p><p class=\"f\"><b>Sinister</b></p>  <p class=\"ni\">These mysterious jet-black creatures most closely resemble <a href=\"/appendix/ray\">manta rays</a>. They have no distinct heads and necks, and their powerfully-muscled wings do not show the prominent finger bones common to most bats. A natural ability of <i>levitation</i> allows them to hang motionless in midair. This unnerving appearance and behavior has earned them their dark name, but sinisters are not evil. Above ground, they prefer to hunt at night, when their 160'-range infravision is most effective. They eat carrion if no other food is available, and regularly devour flowers and seed pods of all sorts.</p><p>Sinisters are both resistant to magic and adept in its use. In addition to their pinpoint, precision <i>levitation</i>, they are surrounded at all times by a naturally-generated 5-foot-deep energy field akin to a <i>wall of force</i>. This field affords no protection against spells or melee attacks, but missile attacks are stopped utterly; normal missiles are turned away, and such effects as <i>magic missile</i> and <i>Melf's acid arrow</i> are absorbed harmlessly. In addition, all sinisters can cast one <i>hold monster</i> (as the spell) once per day. They usually save this for escaping from creatures more powerful than themselves, but may use it when hunting, if ravenous.</p><p>Curiously, though they are always silent (communicating only with others of its kind via 20-foot-range limited telepathy), sinisters love music - both vocal and instrumental. Many a bard making music at a wilderness campfire has found him or herself surrounded by a silent circle of floating sinisters. Unless they are directly attacked, the sinisters will not molest the bard in any way, but may follow the source of the music, gathering night after night to form a rather daunting audience.</p><p>Sinisters are usually encountered in small groups and are thought to have a long life span. Their social habits and mating rituals are unknown.</p><p></p><br clear=\"all\" style=\"clear:both; height:0;\">\r\n","images":["<img src=\"grf/xx.gif\" width=\"150\" height=\"75\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Advanced Dungeons & Dragons 2nd Edition\" title=\"Advanced Dungeons & Dragons 2nd Edition\" align=\"right\">","<img src=\"/img/spc/bat.gif\" width=\"300\" height=\"360\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Bat\" style=\"float:right;\">","<img src=\"grf/tsr_sm.png\" width=\"56\" height=\"59\" border=\"0\" alt=\"TSR\">"],"setting":"Advanced Dungeons & Dragons 2nd Edition","statblock":{"Azmyth":{"Activity Cycle":"Any","Alignment":"Chaotic neutral","Armor Class":"2","Climate/Terrain":"Any land","Damage/Attack":"1/1-2","Diet":"Omnivore","Frequency":"Rare","Hit Dice":"2","Intelligence":"High (13-14)","Magic Resistance":"40%","Morale":"Elite (14)","Movement":"3, Fl 24 (A)","No. Appearing":"1","No. of Attacks":"2","Organization":"Solitary","Size":"S (3')","Special Attacks":"Magic use","Special Defenses":"Magic use","THAC0":"19","Treasure":"Nil","XP Value":"650"},"Common":{"Activity Cycle":"Night","Alignment":"Neutral","Armor Class":"8 (see below)","Climate/Terrain":"Any land","Damage/Attack":"1","Diet":"Omnivore","Frequency":"Common","Hit Dice":"1-2 hp","Intelligence":"Animal (1)","Magic Resistance":"Nil","Morale":"Unsteady (5-7)","Movement":"1, Fl 24 (B)","No. Appearing":"1-100","No. of Attacks":"1","Organization":"Swarm","Size":"T (1')","Special Attacks":"See below","Special Defenses":"Nil","THAC0":"20","Treasure":"Nil","XP Value":"15"},"Huge":{"Activity Cycle":"Night","Alignment":"Neutral evil","Armor Class":"7 (see below)","Climate/Terrain":"Warm caves","Damage/Attack":"2d4","Diet":"Omnivore","Frequency":"Rare","Hit Dice":"4-6","Intelligence":"Low (5-7)","Magic Resistance":"Nil","Morale":"Steady (11-12)","Movement":"3, Fl 15 (C)","No. Appearing":"1-8","No. of Attacks":"1","Organization":"Flock","Size":"H (12-16')","Special Attacks":"See below","Special Defenses":"See below","THAC0":"17 (4 HD)<br>15 (5-6 HD)","Treasure":"C","XP Value":"4 HD: 420<br>5 HD: 650<br>6 HD: 975"},"Large":{"Activity Cycle":"Night","Alignment":"Neutral","Armor Class":"8","Climate/Terrain":"Any land","Damage/Attack":"1d2 or 1d4","Diet":"Omnivore","Frequency":"Uncommon","Hit Dice":"1d4 hp or 1","Intelligence":"Animal (1)","Magic Resistance":"Nil","Morale":"Unsteady (5-7)","Movement":"3, Fl 18 (C)","No. Appearing":"3-18","No. of Attacks":"1","Organization":"Flock","Size":"M (5-6')","Special Attacks":"Nil","Special Defenses":"See below","THAC0":"19 or 20","Treasure":"Nil","XP Value":"35"},"Night Hunter":{"Activity Cycle":"Night/any","Alignment":"Neutral evil","Armor Class":"6","Climate/Terrain":"Any land","Damage/Attack":"1-4/1-2/1-2/1-6 or 3-12","Diet":"Carnivore","Frequency":"Uncommon","Hit Dice":"2+2","Intelligence":"Average to High (8-14)","Magic Resistance":"Nil","Morale":"Steady (11)","Movement":"2, Fl 18 (A)","No. Appearing":"1-12 (1-30 in lair)","No. of Attacks":"4","Organization":"Pack","Size":"M (7')","Special Attacks":"Nil","Special Defenses":"Nil","THAC0":"19","Treasure":"M,O,Z (in lair)","XP Value":"175"},"Sinister":{"Activity Cycle":"Any","Alignment":"Lawful evil","Armor Class":"3","Climate/Terrain":"Any land","Damage/Attack":"2-5","Diet":"Omnivore","Frequency":"Rare","Hit Dice":"4+4","Intelligence":"Average to Except.
