While the powers listed above are the most common, some aarakocra have different or additional powers.</p><p class=\"f\">A race of intelligent, birdlike creatures living in the deepest deserts of Athas, the rare Athasian <a href=\"/appendix/aarakocr\">aarakocra</a> spends its time soaring on thermals in search of food.</p><p>The aarakocra is 7 to 8 feet tall with a wingspan of 20 feet or more. Because of its large wingspan, an aarakocra can carry as much as 75% of its own body weight and still fly easily. An aarakocra can fly a short distance carrying a burden equaling 125% of its own body weight. The average body weight of a full grown male is 100 pounds and a female is 85 pounds.</p><p>Each wing has a &ldquo;hand&rdquo; at its midpoint, consisting of three fingers and an opposable thumb. The fourth finger forms the rigid leading edge of the wing. In flight the hands cannot be used, but on the ground the aarakocra can use its hands almost as a human would. The aarakocra's body is protected by a thin bony plate on the chest, much like a solid rib cage. Talons on its legs can be used as claws and can be retracted to reveal a second set of hands, also with three fingers and an opposable thumb. Except for the chest plate, the entire skeleton is hollow and extremely fragile.</p><p>From a distance, the Athasian aarakocra resembles a huge <a href=\"/appendix/bird\">vulture</a>. Its black eyes, set in the front of the head, provide excellent vision over a long range. The plumage is generally black with a white collar for adult males and black or brown with a smaller white collar for females. Adolescents are a mixture of brown and black. The beak is large and covers most of the head. Plumage begins at the crown of the head and is darker near the head, except for the collar. Athasian aarakocra speak their own language and the languages of vultures and other large birds. Some speak the common tongue (5% to 10% chance depending on how deep in the wastelands a tribe lives).</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Combat:</b> Aarakocra can fight in the air or on the ground. They prefer aerial combat since their bones are too fragile to withstand a solid blow from a human-sized opponent. In combat against creatures on the ground, they prefer to fly over their victim and drop weighted nets. Some aarakocra use darts to harass ground-based opponents.</p><p>If their opponents can fly, the aarakocra generally forgo the use of the net, although large groups sometimes use nets on flying creatures. Normally, aarakocra attack flying creatures with long spears, diving from above and allowing the momentum to carry the spear through the target. Such an attack doubles the damage if the aarakocra have been able to dive at least 50 feet. Only the very largest aarakocra can carry more than one of these spears, they can attack with both at once with no penalty, causing double damage on each strike. All diving attacks are made at +4 and should be treated as a charge attack. All other penalties and restrictions of charge attacks apply.</p><p>The effect of the aarakocra's nets depends on if the opponent is flying at the time it becomes entangled. Creatures on the ground that are hit by a net are entangled and unable to participate in any combat until they make a successful Strength check to get free of the net. Flying creatures hit by a net can no longer fly and immediately begin falling. If they cannot escape the net or use some magical means to arrest the fall, normal falling damage applies.</p><p>Unless victims are entangled in nets, aarakocra are cautious in ground combat. If the aarakocra outnumber their opponents they advance in a straight line and thrust with their spears. If outnumbered, or the opponents are particularly tough, the aarakocra withdraw. Victims entangled in nets are killed or incapacitated for use as food or ransom.</p><p>Athasian aarakocra are mindful of their physical limitations as well as their comparatively low psionic abilities. They do not normally initiate psionic combat. At the first sign of psionic powers from any of their victims, however, all aarakocra that have some ability will use whatever attack and defense modes they can in an attempt to destroy the threat. Large groups of is or more aarakocra may initiate psionic combat if their leaders feel they can win quickly and avoid physical combat.</p><p>In desperation, an aarakocra can attempt to bite an opponent in combat. Because of the unwieldiness of its beak, the aarakocra has a THAC0 of 18 if attacking with this appendage. Further, the birdman causes only 1d2 points of damage with the beak.</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Habitat/Society:</b> Athasian aarakocra live in tribes with 6-20 (2d8+4) members, depending on the prestige of the leader. The largest tribe ever recorded had 50 members. The tribal hunting territory depends on the size of the tribe, usually about 500 square miles for a tribe of 10 members. There are no rigid boundaries between tribes and border disputes are not uncommon.</p><p>Alignments of tribe members are similar to the alignment of the leader. A tribe that has a leader who is neutral good may have neutral good, chaotic good, lawful good, and true neutral members. A predominantly evil tribe does not recognize boundaries with other tribes and treats other tribes as inferior beings to be eliminated.</p><p>Athasian aarakocra aren't happy in enclosed spaces, but they they take refuge in a cave or building if necessary.</p><p>Nonevil tribes live in rocky aeries in the highest peaks they can find. Evil tribes are normally nomadic and use an aerie made by another tribe if they need to remain in an area for a long time, even if they have to evict the tribe that made the nest.</p><p>Aarakocra aren't friendly toward intruders in their territory, especially caravans. They try to extract a toll from the caravan for passage through the desert. Good-aligned tribes allow unhindered passage of caravans that pay a tribute. If someone refuses to pay the tribute, the aarakocra try to capture scouts or outriders from the party and hold them until an even larger tribute is paid. The payment may be either livestock or shiny objects. Aarakocra are smart enough not to be taken in by glass baubles instead of gems, although they cannot tell the difference between the more common gems and the rare ones.</p><p>Evil tribes ask for tribute and often attack a caravan whether it pays or not. Aarakocra always demand shiny objects such as stones. These tribes find humans and demihumans to be quite tasty and prefer them to other food.</p><p>Good-aligned tribes of aarakocra sometimes return a lost traveler to the edge of the desert after first removing any valuables the traveler may be carrying. On very rare occasions a tribe might return a lost group of travelers to the more frequently traveled parts of the desert, again after first taking any valuables as payment.</p><p>The oldest male is the leader of the tribal hunting party and has 4+4 Hit Dice. The oldest female is in charge of the tribal aerie and has 3+3 HD. In tribes that have more than 15 members, the next oldest aarakocra serves as shaman and has 3+3 HD; the shaman completes the triumvirate necessary for proper worship and the summoning of elementals. (Interestingly, no magic-using aarakocra has ever been recorded.) Tribes without a shaman cannot summon <a href=\"/appendix/element1\">air elementals</a>, which is an important part of aarakocra culture.</p><p>The shaman is the leader of the daily sun worship. Aarakocra worship the sun because it provides them with the thermals they need to soar in search of food. The shaman also leads the mystic rituals used to summon an air elemental. Summoning an air elemental is usually done only in preparation for the tribe's most sacred ceremony, the hunt. Small tribes must band together for this ceremony to allow the triumvirate to be formed.</p><p>The ceremony to summon an air elemental must be conducted at dawn and requires the oldest male and female to emit a highpitched keening whistle. The shaman conducts an intricate dance around them, simultaneously chanting an ancient summoning mantra.</p><p>The hunt is the final part of the initiation of adolescent aarakocra to adulthood and often takes the tribe far from their normal teritory. The target is always a <a href=\"/appendix/drakalsi\">silt drake</a>. The hunt is the only time the females leave the relative safety of the nest. Even an evil tribe will not interfere with a tribe on a hunt. An air elemental is often summoned to help find the drake, but never takes part in the actual combat. Although the adult members of the tribe take part in the initial phases of the combat, it is the initiates who deliver the final, killing blows to me drake. Scars from the hunt are considered a mark of pride among all aarakocra.</p><p>The females spend about eight months of the year incubating their eggs. Athasian aarakocra mate for life and a pair normally produces as many as 10 offspring. A female lays one egg a year. Constant incubation is not required because of the high daytime temperatures, so the females can maintain the nest and keep the tribe's treasure in order.</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Ecology:</b> Athasian aarakocra are high on the food chain and have no natural enemies other than <a href=\"/appendix/drakatha\">drakes</a>. Unless evil, aarakocra leave their own territory only to hunt the silt drake and return as soon as possible when the hunt is over. (Evil aarakocra attack others, as noted above.) Aarakocra eggs and hatchlings are sought after by wealthy land owners who wish to use the creatures as scouts and sentries. An egg can bring as much as 10 cp in Tyr's marketplace. Tribes that have had eggs or hatchlings stolen have long memories and sometimes take revenge against the thief at a later date. Captive aarakocra join any tribe they come in contact with.</p><p>Athasian aarakocra have a natural life span of 21-30 years.</p><br clear=\"all\" style=\"clear:both; height:0;\">\r\n","images":["<img src=\"grf/ds.gif\" width=\"150\" height=\"75\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Dark Sun\" title=\"Dark Sun\" align=\"right\">","<img src=\"img/aarakath.gif\" alt=\"Aarakocra (Athas)\" title=\"Aarakocra (Athas)\" border=\"0\" width=\"300\" height=\"360\" style=\"text-align:right;\" align=\"right\">","<img src=\"grf/add2_01.gif\" width=\"200\" height=\"56\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Advanced Dungeons & Dragons 2nd Edition\">"],"setting":"Dark Sun","statblock":{"Aarakocra (Athas)":{"Activity Cycle":"Day","Alignment":"Any","Armor Class":"7","Climate/Terrain":"Deep desert","Damage/Attack":"1d3/1d3 or by weapon","Diet":"Carnivore","Frequency":"Rare","Hit Dice":"2+2","Intelligence":"Average (8-10)","Magic Resistance":"Nil","Morale":"Steady (11)","Movement":"6, Fl 36 (C)","No. Appearing":"1d10","No. of Attacks":"2","Organization":"Tribal","Size":"M (20'+ wingspan)","Special Attacks":"Nil","Special Defenses":"Nil","THAC0":"17","Treasure":"Varies","XP Value":"65"}},"title":"Aarakocra (Athas)"},"sources":["2433"],"statblock_names":[],"title":"Aarakocra (Athas)","prev_key":"zygraat","next_key":"aarakocr","monster_path":"/appendix/aarakath"}}},"pageContext":{"monster_key":"chososio","monster_data":{"TSR":["2635"],"fullBody":"  <table cellspacing=\"0\" cellpadding=\"0\"><tr><th>Climate/Terrain:</th><td>Inner Planes</td></tr><tr><th>Frequency:</th><td>Very rare</td></tr><tr><th>Organization:</th><td>Solitary</td></tr><tr><th>Activity Cycle:</th><td>Any</td></tr><tr><th>Diet:</th><td>Inner-planar nature</td></tr><tr><th>Intelligence:</th><td>High (13-14)</td></tr><tr><th>Treasure:</th><td>Nil</td></tr><tr><th>Alignment:</th><td>Neutral</td></tr><tr><th>No. Appearing:</th><td>1</td></tr><tr><th>Armor Class:</th><td>-5</td></tr><tr><th>Movement:</th><td>Fl 12 (A)</td></tr><tr><th>Hit Dice:</th><td>8</td></tr><tr><th>THAC0:</th><td>13</td></tr><tr><th>No. of Attacks:</th><td>2</td></tr><tr><th>Damage/Attack:</th><td>1d8/1d8</td></tr><tr><th>Special Attacks:</th><td>Discorporating poison</td></tr><tr><th>Special Defenses:</th><td>Struck only by +4 or better weapons, immunities</td></tr><tr><th>Magic Resistance:</th><td>95%</td></tr><tr><th>Size:</th><td>M (6' across)</td></tr><tr><th>Morale:</th><td>Elite (14)</td></tr><tr><th>XP Value:</th><td>8,000</td></tr></table><p class=\"f\">A creature found (or, at least, seen) only on the Ethereal and the Inner Planes. the chososion seeps mainly through the e1emental worlds. Most who've spied it, however, would say that it never really enters the space the rest of us inhabit. That is, it's always just out of touch. More than simply ethereal - like a <a href=\"/appendix/ghost\">ghost</a> on a prime-material world - the chososion is intangible on any plane. Even sorcery can barely affect it.</p><p>Despite this quality, the chososion appears substantial when a basher manages to lay eyes on one (they're extraordinarily rare). Its wide body, colored black or dark blue, is composed primarily of many winglike flaps of flesh. The entire creature seems to be in constant motion, as though the waving of its strange appendages keeps it within physical reality as it's understood. Chant is that if these flexible ridges stop their rippling motion, the chososion disappears. Beyond the ever-moving mass of the creature, a mouthlike opening lies buried in its fluttering fins.</p><p>First encountered by the <a href=\"/appendix/shad\">shad</a> of the Elemental Plane of earth, the chososion gets its name from that race's word for &ldquo;out of reach&rdquo;.</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Combat:</b> So how does a cutter harm a creature that's not really all there? A better question might be why he'd want to. Still, the chososion can become a threat to planewalkers and natives to the realms through which it seeps. If disturbed, the beast is likely to react with violence.</p><p>Graybeards don't wholly understand the chososion's means of attack. When the creature grows angry, two long, flexible pseudopods ending in flat grasping pads stretch out from its mouth. Unlike the rest of the beast's body, the pseudopods're fully corporeal and covered with thousands of tiny, razor-sharp hooks. They inflict terrible injuries on any sod they strike (1d8 points of damage each), but the real danger comes from the poison secreted into the wounds by the grasping pads.</p><p>A chososion's poison is, by most standards, magical. If the victim fails a saving throw versus poison, he becomes paralyzed in 1d6 rounds. Once paralyzed, the sod must make a saving throw versus death magic. If he makes that save, he merely remains paralyzed for 3d6 rounds. But if he fails the second saving throw, the poison completely discorporates him (treat the victim as if disintegrated). Some folks claim that the poor bark leaves our reality and enters the chososion's realm - beyond any known plane. But popular chant says the victim's just gone, period. See, most folks believe that there are no planes beyond those already known and named, and even if there were, why would the chososion bring a foe to its home, where presumably it's more vulnerable?</p><p>A body can accept whichever theory he likes. Either way, he'll never again see a friend lost to chososion poison.</p><p>Fighting back against the creature is sodding difficult. Fact is, a basher'd be much better off just running away. With a 95% resistance to magic, a chososion's affected by only a few choice spells. It's not bothered by the environmental hazards of the Inner Planes; truth is, it seems not even to notice them. What's more, the beast completely shrugs off all nonmagical attacks (poison, gas, heat, cold, acid, and so on).</p><p>Fighting it with a weapon is just as hard, if not harder - only those with an enchantment of +4 or greater can wound the beast. And as any planewalker knows, it's tricky enough to keep any enchantment to a blade when hopping around the multiverse, let alone as mighty a dweomer as that.</p><p>However, the chososion does have a weak spot: the corporeal pseudopods (tongues?) that protrude from its mouth. These are quite real and solid, capable of touching and being touched. Each pseudopod has 2 Hit Dice and an Armor Class of 4, and its hit points are separate from the creature's total. In fact, these strange extensions are more like organic tools than actual parts of the chososion's body, and the monster treats them as if they were completely expendable.</p><p>All chososions can grow new pseudopods to replace destroyed members. Most require 1d6 hours to do so. However, sometimes (25% of the time) a chososion already has 1d4 replacement limbs tucked away inside its body, ready to shoot out immediately when needed. But no chososion can operate more than two pseudopods at once.</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Habitat/Society:</b> If the theory that the chososion actually inhabits some unknown plane is true, then it may also be true that the creature can intersect the known multiverse only at its most primal, basic point - the Innter Planes. Supporters of this idea claim that the chososion is most likely fully tangible on its own plane, as is an ethereal creature on the Ethereal Plane.</p><p>In fact, a graybeard named Vivan who holds to this theory speculates that the creature's home plane intersects and permeates the multiverse only in the Inner Planes, similar to the way the Ethereal touches the Inner Planes and the Prime. Vivan also believes that this unknown plane, which he calls the Macrocosm, could act as a bridge to an entirely different multiverse. 'Course, Vivan now resides in the Madhouse with all the other barmies in Sigil.</p><p>Here's what's known for sure: The chososion haunts the Inner Planes looking for food. It never congregates in groups, nor does it have a perceivable society. Though the creature seems highly intelligent, no one's discovered any proof that it can (or will) communicate with others. Its method of reproduction is a mystery and will most likely remain dark. However, if Vivan is correct, the chososion may have a complex society and culture on its mysterious home plane, complete with young - but how would anyone ever know?</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Ecology:</b> The chososion interacts with the environment around it only by accident. It apparently feeds on the primal nature of the Inner Planes, but not the elements or beings within the planes themselves. It need never encounter another creature (native or otherwise), but sometimes bad luck brings a poor sod right into a chososion's path. Perhaps misunderstanding the newcomer's intentions, the chososion always reacts defensively and usually attacks on sight.</p><p>On the other hand, it's possible that a hostile chososion attacks only because it's confused by or fearful of a basher's very nature. See, Vivan claims that the chososion regards inhabitants of the known planes the same way most folks view environmental dangers of the Inner Planes (heat from the plane of Fire, fumes from the paraplane of Smoke, and so on) - as something to be avoided or conquered.</p><br clear=\"all\" style=\"clear:both; height:0;\">\r\n","images":["<img src=\"grf/ps.gif\" width=\"150\" height=\"75\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Planescape\" title=\"Planescape\" align=\"right\">","<img src=\"img/chososio.gif\" alt=\"Chososion\" title=\"Chososion\" border=\"0\" width=\"300\" height=\"360\" style=\"text-align:right;\" align=\"right\">","<img src=\"grf/add2_01.gif\" width=\"200\" height=\"56\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Advanced Dungeons & Dragons 2nd Edition\">"],"setting":"Planescape","statblock":{"Chososion":{"Activity Cycle":"Any","Alignment":"Neutral","Armor Class":"-5","Climate/Terrain":"Inner Planes","Damage/Attack":"1d8/1d8","Diet":"Inner-planar nature","Frequency":"Very rare","Hit Dice":"8","Intelligence":"High (13-14)","Magic Resistance":"95%","Morale":"Elite (14)","Movement":"Fl 12 (A)","No. Appearing":"1","No. of Attacks":"2","Organization":"Solitary","Size":"M (6' across)","Special Attacks":"Discorporating poison","Special Defenses":"Struck only by +4 or better weapons, immunities","THAC0":"13","Treasure":"Nil","XP Value":"8,000"}},"title":"Chososion"},"sources":["2635"],"statblock_names":[],"title":"Chososion","prev_key":"chosenon","next_key":"chraal","monster_path":"/appendix/chososio"}},"staticQueryHashes":[],"slicesMap":{}}
