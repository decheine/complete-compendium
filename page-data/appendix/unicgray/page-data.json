They emit a field from their bodies that reflects the exact amount of damage done to them in physical combat back upon their enemies. Because their enemies must be in physical contact with the gray unicorns to receive this backlash, the gray unicorns are only rarely attacked by carnivores, who learn to leave them alone after one attack; smarter beings use missile fire, but they might still be attacked if the gray unicorns teleport and charge them. Gray unicorns will usually not retaliate unless they are attacked more than once by the same being or are pursued by missile fire.</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Habitat/Society:</b> Gray unicorns (sometimes called &ldquo;graycorns&rdquo;) are usually found in herds, each consisting of one stallion and several mares. Gray unicorns can be ridden only by strictly neutral, passive druidic females, either humans or demihumans.</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Ecology:</b> Gray unicorns live on the grasslands in subtropical climates. Their horns can be carved and enchanted to produce <i>rings of spell turning</i> or can be used in the creation of <i>potions of invulnerability</i>.</p><br clear=\"all\" style=\"clear:both; height:0;\">\r\n","images":["<img src=\"grf/dr.gif\" width=\"150\" height=\"75\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Dragon Magazine\" title=\"Dragon Magazine\" align=\"right\">","<img src=\"grf/add2_01.gif\" width=\"200\" height=\"56\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Advanced Dungeons & Dragons 2nd Edition\">"],"setting":"Dragon Magazine","statblock":{"Unicorn, Gray":{"Activity Cycle":"Day","Alignment":"Neutral","Armor Class":"2","Climate/Terrain":"Subtropical/Grasslands","Damage/Attack":"1-6/1-6/1-10","Diet":"Herbivore","Frequency":"Rare","Hit Dice":"3+4","Intelligence":"Average (8-10)","Magic Resistance":"10%","Morale":"Elite (13-14)","Movement":"18","No. Appearing":"1-10","No. of Attacks":"3","Organization":"Herd","Size":"L","Special Attacks":"See below","Special Defenses":"See below","THAC0":"17","Treasure":"Nil","XP Value":"1,400"}},"title":"Unicorn, Gray"},"sources":["Dragon#190"],"statblock_names":[],"title":"Unicorn, Gray","prev_key":"unicfaer","next_key":"unicorn","monster_path":"/appendix/unicgray"}},"staticQueryHashes":[],"slicesMap":{}}
