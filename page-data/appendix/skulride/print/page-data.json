While the powers listed above are the most common, some aarakocra have different or additional powers.</p><p class=\"f\">A race of intelligent, birdlike creatures living in the deepest deserts of Athas, the rare Athasian <a href=\"/appendix/aarakocr\">aarakocra</a> spends its time soaring on thermals in search of food.</p><p>The aarakocra is 7 to 8 feet tall with a wingspan of 20 feet or more. Because of its large wingspan, an aarakocra can carry as much as 75% of its own body weight and still fly easily. An aarakocra can fly a short distance carrying a burden equaling 125% of its own body weight. The average body weight of a full grown male is 100 pounds and a female is 85 pounds.</p><p>Each wing has a &ldquo;hand&rdquo; at its midpoint, consisting of three fingers and an opposable thumb. The fourth finger forms the rigid leading edge of the wing. In flight the hands cannot be used, but on the ground the aarakocra can use its hands almost as a human would. The aarakocra's body is protected by a thin bony plate on the chest, much like a solid rib cage. Talons on its legs can be used as claws and can be retracted to reveal a second set of hands, also with three fingers and an opposable thumb. Except for the chest plate, the entire skeleton is hollow and extremely fragile.</p><p>From a distance, the Athasian aarakocra resembles a huge <a href=\"/appendix/bird\">vulture</a>. Its black eyes, set in the front of the head, provide excellent vision over a long range. The plumage is generally black with a white collar for adult males and black or brown with a smaller white collar for females. Adolescents are a mixture of brown and black. The beak is large and covers most of the head. Plumage begins at the crown of the head and is darker near the head, except for the collar. Athasian aarakocra speak their own language and the languages of vultures and other large birds. Some speak the common tongue (5% to 10% chance depending on how deep in the wastelands a tribe lives).</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Combat:</b> Aarakocra can fight in the air or on the ground. They prefer aerial combat since their bones are too fragile to withstand a solid blow from a human-sized opponent. In combat against creatures on the ground, they prefer to fly over their victim and drop weighted nets. Some aarakocra use darts to harass ground-based opponents.</p><p>If their opponents can fly, the aarakocra generally forgo the use of the net, although large groups sometimes use nets on flying creatures. Normally, aarakocra attack flying creatures with long spears, diving from above and allowing the momentum to carry the spear through the target. Such an attack doubles the damage if the aarakocra have been able to dive at least 50 feet. Only the very largest aarakocra can carry more than one of these spears, they can attack with both at once with no penalty, causing double damage on each strike. All diving attacks are made at +4 and should be treated as a charge attack. All other penalties and restrictions of charge attacks apply.</p><p>The effect of the aarakocra's nets depends on if the opponent is flying at the time it becomes entangled. Creatures on the ground that are hit by a net are entangled and unable to participate in any combat until they make a successful Strength check to get free of the net. Flying creatures hit by a net can no longer fly and immediately begin falling. If they cannot escape the net or use some magical means to arrest the fall, normal falling damage applies.</p><p>Unless victims are entangled in nets, aarakocra are cautious in ground combat. If the aarakocra outnumber their opponents they advance in a straight line and thrust with their spears. If outnumbered, or the opponents are particularly tough, the aarakocra withdraw. Victims entangled in nets are killed or incapacitated for use as food or ransom.</p><p>Athasian aarakocra are mindful of their physical limitations as well as their comparatively low psionic abilities. They do not normally initiate psionic combat. At the first sign of psionic powers from any of their victims, however, all aarakocra that have some ability will use whatever attack and defense modes they can in an attempt to destroy the threat. Large groups of is or more aarakocra may initiate psionic combat if their leaders feel they can win quickly and avoid physical combat.</p><p>In desperation, an aarakocra can attempt to bite an opponent in combat. Because of the unwieldiness of its beak, the aarakocra has a THAC0 of 18 if attacking with this appendage. Further, the birdman causes only 1d2 points of damage with the beak.</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Habitat/Society:</b> Athasian aarakocra live in tribes with 6-20 (2d8+4) members, depending on the prestige of the leader. The largest tribe ever recorded had 50 members. The tribal hunting territory depends on the size of the tribe, usually about 500 square miles for a tribe of 10 members. There are no rigid boundaries between tribes and border disputes are not uncommon.</p><p>Alignments of tribe members are similar to the alignment of the leader. A tribe that has a leader who is neutral good may have neutral good, chaotic good, lawful good, and true neutral members. A predominantly evil tribe does not recognize boundaries with other tribes and treats other tribes as inferior beings to be eliminated.</p><p>Athasian aarakocra aren't happy in enclosed spaces, but they they take refuge in a cave or building if necessary.</p><p>Nonevil tribes live in rocky aeries in the highest peaks they can find. Evil tribes are normally nomadic and use an aerie made by another tribe if they need to remain in an area for a long time, even if they have to evict the tribe that made the nest.</p><p>Aarakocra aren't friendly toward intruders in their territory, especially caravans. They try to extract a toll from the caravan for passage through the desert. Good-aligned tribes allow unhindered passage of caravans that pay a tribute. If someone refuses to pay the tribute, the aarakocra try to capture scouts or outriders from the party and hold them until an even larger tribute is paid. The payment may be either livestock or shiny objects. Aarakocra are smart enough not to be taken in by glass baubles instead of gems, although they cannot tell the difference between the more common gems and the rare ones.</p><p>Evil tribes ask for tribute and often attack a caravan whether it pays or not. Aarakocra always demand shiny objects such as stones. These tribes find humans and demihumans to be quite tasty and prefer them to other food.</p><p>Good-aligned tribes of aarakocra sometimes return a lost traveler to the edge of the desert after first removing any valuables the traveler may be carrying. On very rare occasions a tribe might return a lost group of travelers to the more frequently traveled parts of the desert, again after first taking any valuables as payment.</p><p>The oldest male is the leader of the tribal hunting party and has 4+4 Hit Dice. The oldest female is in charge of the tribal aerie and has 3+3 HD. In tribes that have more than 15 members, the next oldest aarakocra serves as shaman and has 3+3 HD; the shaman completes the triumvirate necessary for proper worship and the summoning of elementals. (Interestingly, no magic-using aarakocra has ever been recorded.) Tribes without a shaman cannot summon <a href=\"/appendix/element1\">air elementals</a>, which is an important part of aarakocra culture.</p><p>The shaman is the leader of the daily sun worship. Aarakocra worship the sun because it provides them with the thermals they need to soar in search of food. The shaman also leads the mystic rituals used to summon an air elemental. Summoning an air elemental is usually done only in preparation for the tribe's most sacred ceremony, the hunt. Small tribes must band together for this ceremony to allow the triumvirate to be formed.</p><p>The ceremony to summon an air elemental must be conducted at dawn and requires the oldest male and female to emit a highpitched keening whistle. The shaman conducts an intricate dance around them, simultaneously chanting an ancient summoning mantra.</p><p>The hunt is the final part of the initiation of adolescent aarakocra to adulthood and often takes the tribe far from their normal teritory. The target is always a <a href=\"/appendix/drakalsi\">silt drake</a>. The hunt is the only time the females leave the relative safety of the nest. Even an evil tribe will not interfere with a tribe on a hunt. An air elemental is often summoned to help find the drake, but never takes part in the actual combat. Although the adult members of the tribe take part in the initial phases of the combat, it is the initiates who deliver the final, killing blows to me drake. Scars from the hunt are considered a mark of pride among all aarakocra.</p><p>The females spend about eight months of the year incubating their eggs. Athasian aarakocra mate for life and a pair normally produces as many as 10 offspring. A female lays one egg a year. Constant incubation is not required because of the high daytime temperatures, so the females can maintain the nest and keep the tribe's treasure in order.</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Ecology:</b> Athasian aarakocra are high on the food chain and have no natural enemies other than <a href=\"/appendix/drakatha\">drakes</a>. Unless evil, aarakocra leave their own territory only to hunt the silt drake and return as soon as possible when the hunt is over. (Evil aarakocra attack others, as noted above.) Aarakocra eggs and hatchlings are sought after by wealthy land owners who wish to use the creatures as scouts and sentries. An egg can bring as much as 10 cp in Tyr's marketplace. Tribes that have had eggs or hatchlings stolen have long memories and sometimes take revenge against the thief at a later date. Captive aarakocra join any tribe they come in contact with.</p><p>Athasian aarakocra have a natural life span of 21-30 years.</p>\n","images":["<img src=\"grf/ds.gif\" width=\"150\" height=\"75\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Dark Sun\" title=\"Dark Sun\" align=\"right\">","<img src=\"img/aarakath.gif\" alt=\"Aarakocra (Athas)\" title=\"Aarakocra (Athas)\" border=\"0\" width=\"300\" height=\"360\" style=\"text-align:right;\" align=\"right\">","<img src=\"grf/add2_01.gif\" width=\"200\" height=\"56\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Advanced Dungeons & Dragons 2nd Edition\">"],"setting":"Dark Sun","statblock":{"Aarakocra (Athas)":{"Activity Cycle":"Day","Alignment":"Any","Armor Class":"7","Climate/Terrain":"Deep desert","Damage/Attack":"1d3/1d3 or by weapon","Diet":"Carnivore","Frequency":"Rare","Hit Dice":"2+2","Intelligence":"Average (8-10)","Magic Resistance":"Nil","Morale":"Steady (11)","Movement":"6, Fl 36 (C)","No. Appearing":"1d10","No. of Attacks":"2","Organization":"Tribal","Size":"M (20'+ wingspan)","Special Attacks":"Nil","Special Defenses":"Nil","THAC0":"17","Treasure":"Varies","XP Value":"65"}},"title":"Aarakocra (Athas)"},"sources":["2433"],"statblock_names":[],"title":"Aarakocra (Athas)","prev_key":"zygraat","next_key":"aarakocr","monster_path":"/appendix/aarakath"}}},"pageContext":{"monster_key":"skulride","monster_data":{"TSR":["Dragon198"],"fullBody":"  <table cellspacing=\"0\" cellpadding=\"0\"><tr><th>Climate/Terrain:</th>  <td>Any land</td></tr><tr><th>Frequency:</th>        <td>Very rare</td></tr><tr><th>Organization:</th>     <td>Solitary or small groups</td></tr><tr><th>Activity Cycle:</th>   <td>Any (usually nocturnal)</td></tr><tr><th>Diet:</th>             <td>Carnivore</td></tr><tr><th>Intelligence:</th>     <td>Average (8-10)</td></tr><tr><th>Treasure:</th>         <td>Q x 10 in lair, residual on host</td></tr><tr><th>Alignment:</th>        <td>Chaotic evil</td></tr><tr><th>No. Appearing:</th>    <td>1-8</td></tr><tr><th>Armor Class:</th>      <td>4 (host: 8)</td></tr><tr><th>Movement:</th>         <td>9 (12 on host)</td></tr><tr><th>Hit Dice:</th>         <td>1+4 (host: 2)</td></tr><tr><th>THAC0:</th>            <td>19</td></tr><tr><th>No. of Attacks:</th>   <td>1</td></tr><tr><th>Damage/Attack:</th>    <td>1-4 (or by weapon type)</td></tr><tr><th>Special Attacks:</th>  <td>Surprise, poison, control host</td></tr><tr><th>Special Defenses:</th> <td>Immune to sticky substances, disguise</td></tr><tr><th>Magic Resistance:</th> <td>Nil</td></tr><tr><th>Size:</th>             <td>S (1' tall)</td></tr><tr><th>Morale:</th>           <td>Steady 111-121</td></tr><tr><th>XP Value:</th>         <td>420</td></tr></table><p class=\"f\">A skullrider is a spiderlike creature whose eight segmented legs grow out of a body the size and shape of a human skull. Its shiny exoskeleton is the approximate color and texture of human bone, supporting the illusion. Vicious mandibles are hidden inside the \"jawbone\" of the skull; these mandibles are retractable, as are the creature's eight short legs. The bony exoskeleton prevents body heat from emanating, thus making the skullrider \"invisible\" to infravision. A skullrider with mandibles and legs retracted is thus 90% indistinguishable from a regular human skull.</p><p>Due to its spidery nature, a skullrider can climb sheer surfaces and move at normal speed through webs (magical and otherwise), although it cannot create webs of its own. It is immune to all sticky substances, magical or mundane, such as <i>web</i> spells or glue. When encountered in this form, the normal statistics above are used.</p><p>However, 75% of all skullrider encounters are with \"mounted\" skullriders. In this case, the statistics in parentheses are used. A skullrider has the ability to control a newly dead human, demihuman, or humanoid body (\"host\") with which it has bonded. The bonding process is as follows: A skullrider uses its mandibles and sharp, hollow tongue to pierce into a corpse's skull and devour selected parts of the brain. This permits the skullrider to mentally link with the corpse's nervous system, and this in turn allows the skullrider to animate the corpse at will, even when not in contact with the body. Only one host can be animated by a single skullrider at any one time. The bonding process takes two full rounds and must be started within one hour of the death of the host body.</p><p>Although a skullrider can move its animated host from any distance up to 60' (provided it maintains a line of sight), it is most common for the creature to consume the head of its host body and sit atop the severed neck with legs retracted underneath them. This gives the mounted skullrider the appearance of a skull-headed <a href=\"/appendix/zombie\">zombie</a>. A skullriders can control only a newly dead humanoid body; in no case can it animate a skeleton (which has no brains to ingest or central nervous system to link with) or true undead of any kind. A skullrider host is truly dead, animated by the skullriders' magical mental link instead of a link to the Negative Material plane common to undead creatures; therefore the host cannot be turned by priests or paladins.</p><p>A host body separated from its controlling skullrider remains animated only so long as the skullrider is paying full attention to that control, taking no actions other than moving at MV 6. Combat, full movement, unconsciousness, and so forth breaks the link, causing the corpse to fall. A <i>dispel magic</i> spell cast on the skullrider or host (against sixth-level spell-use) or any form of anti-magic field or spell will also break the link. Once a link has been magically broken between host and skullrider, it cannot be reestablished.</p><p>As a side note, any corpse whose head has been consumed by a skullrider cannot be restored to life by any means short of a <i>wish</i> spell. The corpse can, however, be <i>animated</i> into a zombie or (later) a <a href=\"/appendix/skeleton\">skeleton</a>.</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Combat:</b> Mounted skullriders usually attack with a weapon, if their host body has one. Any magical bonuses inherent in the weapons apply, but skullrider host bodies do not get any bonuses to hit or to damage based on their Strength or Dexterity scores, whatever they might have been. Skullriders are considered proficient in all melee weapons that can be wielded with one hand. Those weapons requiring two hands may be used at a nonproficiency penalty of -2 to hit. Missile weapons can not be used, as skullriders lack the coordination and finesse to properly employ them (but a mounted skullrider armed with a crossbow could swing it like a club). Skullriders can have their host bodies attack with weapons while they are not riding them, but suffer a penalty of -2 on attacks and damage due to problems of perspective and vantage points.</p><p>A mounted skullrider in combat takes no damage until its host has been destroyed (use the armor-class, movement, and hit-dice statistics above). At this point, the host body collapses (assumedly so badly damaged it cannot stand or fight) and the skullrider either scuttles away (if opposition is strong) or moves in close to bite.</p><p>Skullriders can bite in combat for 1-4 hp damage, and anyone bitten must save vs. poison or lose an additional 2d4 hp. Mounted skullriders can leap off their mounts onto opponents in order to bite with a surprise bonus of +2 to hit (the host body promptly collapses in a heap). This bonus applies only when the opponent is unaware of the skullrider's ability to do so.</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Habitat/Society:</b> Skullriders are primarily scavengers, preferring to attain their mounts from fresh battlefields rather than attack a healthy individual, but do not hesitate to do the latter if it appears that there's a good chance of success.</p><p>Skullrider host bodies continue to decay, but due to an enzyme secreted into the body at the time of bonding, the process is slowed down. Generally, a skullrider can use a corpse for about a month before its central nervous system deteriorates to the point where the body can no longer be animated. At this point, the body is used as a food source by the skullriders. Finally, the corpse is injected with 10-60 eggs and abandoned. In two to three weeks, the eggs will hatch into new skullriders, which spend most of their first six months feeding and growing. At the end of the six-month period of growth, the skullriders will have attained full size and acquired the ability to animate mounts.</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Ecology:</b> Skullriders have no concept of treasure, but understand the advantages of hand-held weapons They enjoy gemstones for their color and brilliance. The lair of a group of skullriders will often include the human skulls of their previous mounts. These are used primarily for camouflage purposes, so that the skullriders blend in with their surroundings if someone or something enters their lair. In this case, the skullrider can jump out and attack, with a +2 bonus for surprise.</p><p>Skullriders, as mentioned earlier, are generally scavengers that sometimes take live prey. Their rarity makes them of little consequence except to those who fall victim to them.</p>\n","images":["<img src=\"grf/dr.gif\" width=\"150\" height=\"75\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Dragon Magazine\" title=\"Dragon Magazine\" align=\"right\">","<img src=\"img/skulride.gif\" alt=\"Skullrider\" title=\"Skullrider\" border=\"0\" width=\"300\" height=\"360\" style=\"text-align:right;\" align=\"right\">","<img src=\"grf/tsr_sm.png\" width=\"56\" height=\"59\" border=\"0\" alt=\"TSR\">"],"setting":"Dragon Magazine","statblock":{"Skullrider":{"Activity Cycle":"Any (usually nocturnal)","Alignment":"Chaotic evil","Armor Class":"4 (host: 8)","Climate/Terrain":"Any land","Damage/Attack":"1-4 (or by weapon type)","Diet":"Carnivore","Frequency":"Very rare","Hit Dice":"1+4 (host: 2)","Intelligence":"Average (8-10)","Magic Resistance":"Nil","Morale":"Steady 111-121","Movement":"9 (12 on host)","No. Appearing":"1-8","No. of Attacks":"1","Organization":"Solitary or small groups","Size":"S (1' tall)","Special Attacks":"Surprise, poison, control host","Special Defenses":"Immune to sticky substances, disguise","THAC0":"19","Treasure":"Q x 10 in lair, residual on host","XP Value":"420"}},"title":"Skullrider"},"sources":["Dragon198"],"statblock_names":[],"title":"Skullrider","prev_key":"skullbir","next_key":"skum","monster_path":"/appendix/skulride"}},"staticQueryHashes":[],"slicesMap":{}}
