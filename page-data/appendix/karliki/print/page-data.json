While the powers listed above are the most common, some aarakocra have different or additional powers.</p><p class=\"f\">A race of intelligent, birdlike creatures living in the deepest deserts of Athas, the rare Athasian <a href=\"/appendix/aarakocr\">aarakocra</a> spends its time soaring on thermals in search of food.</p><p>The aarakocra is 7 to 8 feet tall with a wingspan of 20 feet or more. Because of its large wingspan, an aarakocra can carry as much as 75% of its own body weight and still fly easily. An aarakocra can fly a short distance carrying a burden equaling 125% of its own body weight. The average body weight of a full grown male is 100 pounds and a female is 85 pounds.</p><p>Each wing has a &ldquo;hand&rdquo; at its midpoint, consisting of three fingers and an opposable thumb. The fourth finger forms the rigid leading edge of the wing. In flight the hands cannot be used, but on the ground the aarakocra can use its hands almost as a human would. The aarakocra's body is protected by a thin bony plate on the chest, much like a solid rib cage. Talons on its legs can be used as claws and can be retracted to reveal a second set of hands, also with three fingers and an opposable thumb. Except for the chest plate, the entire skeleton is hollow and extremely fragile.</p><p>From a distance, the Athasian aarakocra resembles a huge <a href=\"/appendix/bird\">vulture</a>. Its black eyes, set in the front of the head, provide excellent vision over a long range. The plumage is generally black with a white collar for adult males and black or brown with a smaller white collar for females. Adolescents are a mixture of brown and black. The beak is large and covers most of the head. Plumage begins at the crown of the head and is darker near the head, except for the collar. Athasian aarakocra speak their own language and the languages of vultures and other large birds. Some speak the common tongue (5% to 10% chance depending on how deep in the wastelands a tribe lives).</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Combat:</b> Aarakocra can fight in the air or on the ground. They prefer aerial combat since their bones are too fragile to withstand a solid blow from a human-sized opponent. In combat against creatures on the ground, they prefer to fly over their victim and drop weighted nets. Some aarakocra use darts to harass ground-based opponents.</p><p>If their opponents can fly, the aarakocra generally forgo the use of the net, although large groups sometimes use nets on flying creatures. Normally, aarakocra attack flying creatures with long spears, diving from above and allowing the momentum to carry the spear through the target. Such an attack doubles the damage if the aarakocra have been able to dive at least 50 feet. Only the very largest aarakocra can carry more than one of these spears, they can attack with both at once with no penalty, causing double damage on each strike. All diving attacks are made at +4 and should be treated as a charge attack. All other penalties and restrictions of charge attacks apply.</p><p>The effect of the aarakocra's nets depends on if the opponent is flying at the time it becomes entangled. Creatures on the ground that are hit by a net are entangled and unable to participate in any combat until they make a successful Strength check to get free of the net. Flying creatures hit by a net can no longer fly and immediately begin falling. If they cannot escape the net or use some magical means to arrest the fall, normal falling damage applies.</p><p>Unless victims are entangled in nets, aarakocra are cautious in ground combat. If the aarakocra outnumber their opponents they advance in a straight line and thrust with their spears. If outnumbered, or the opponents are particularly tough, the aarakocra withdraw. Victims entangled in nets are killed or incapacitated for use as food or ransom.</p><p>Athasian aarakocra are mindful of their physical limitations as well as their comparatively low psionic abilities. They do not normally initiate psionic combat. At the first sign of psionic powers from any of their victims, however, all aarakocra that have some ability will use whatever attack and defense modes they can in an attempt to destroy the threat. Large groups of is or more aarakocra may initiate psionic combat if their leaders feel they can win quickly and avoid physical combat.</p><p>In desperation, an aarakocra can attempt to bite an opponent in combat. Because of the unwieldiness of its beak, the aarakocra has a THAC0 of 18 if attacking with this appendage. Further, the birdman causes only 1d2 points of damage with the beak.</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Habitat/Society:</b> Athasian aarakocra live in tribes with 6-20 (2d8+4) members, depending on the prestige of the leader. The largest tribe ever recorded had 50 members. The tribal hunting territory depends on the size of the tribe, usually about 500 square miles for a tribe of 10 members. There are no rigid boundaries between tribes and border disputes are not uncommon.</p><p>Alignments of tribe members are similar to the alignment of the leader. A tribe that has a leader who is neutral good may have neutral good, chaotic good, lawful good, and true neutral members. A predominantly evil tribe does not recognize boundaries with other tribes and treats other tribes as inferior beings to be eliminated.</p><p>Athasian aarakocra aren't happy in enclosed spaces, but they they take refuge in a cave or building if necessary.</p><p>Nonevil tribes live in rocky aeries in the highest peaks they can find. Evil tribes are normally nomadic and use an aerie made by another tribe if they need to remain in an area for a long time, even if they have to evict the tribe that made the nest.</p><p>Aarakocra aren't friendly toward intruders in their territory, especially caravans. They try to extract a toll from the caravan for passage through the desert. Good-aligned tribes allow unhindered passage of caravans that pay a tribute. If someone refuses to pay the tribute, the aarakocra try to capture scouts or outriders from the party and hold them until an even larger tribute is paid. The payment may be either livestock or shiny objects. Aarakocra are smart enough not to be taken in by glass baubles instead of gems, although they cannot tell the difference between the more common gems and the rare ones.</p><p>Evil tribes ask for tribute and often attack a caravan whether it pays or not. Aarakocra always demand shiny objects such as stones. These tribes find humans and demihumans to be quite tasty and prefer them to other food.</p><p>Good-aligned tribes of aarakocra sometimes return a lost traveler to the edge of the desert after first removing any valuables the traveler may be carrying. On very rare occasions a tribe might return a lost group of travelers to the more frequently traveled parts of the desert, again after first taking any valuables as payment.</p><p>The oldest male is the leader of the tribal hunting party and has 4+4 Hit Dice. The oldest female is in charge of the tribal aerie and has 3+3 HD. In tribes that have more than 15 members, the next oldest aarakocra serves as shaman and has 3+3 HD; the shaman completes the triumvirate necessary for proper worship and the summoning of elementals. (Interestingly, no magic-using aarakocra has ever been recorded.) Tribes without a shaman cannot summon <a href=\"/appendix/element1\">air elementals</a>, which is an important part of aarakocra culture.</p><p>The shaman is the leader of the daily sun worship. Aarakocra worship the sun because it provides them with the thermals they need to soar in search of food. The shaman also leads the mystic rituals used to summon an air elemental. Summoning an air elemental is usually done only in preparation for the tribe's most sacred ceremony, the hunt. Small tribes must band together for this ceremony to allow the triumvirate to be formed.</p><p>The ceremony to summon an air elemental must be conducted at dawn and requires the oldest male and female to emit a highpitched keening whistle. The shaman conducts an intricate dance around them, simultaneously chanting an ancient summoning mantra.</p><p>The hunt is the final part of the initiation of adolescent aarakocra to adulthood and often takes the tribe far from their normal teritory. The target is always a <a href=\"/appendix/drakalsi\">silt drake</a>. The hunt is the only time the females leave the relative safety of the nest. Even an evil tribe will not interfere with a tribe on a hunt. An air elemental is often summoned to help find the drake, but never takes part in the actual combat. Although the adult members of the tribe take part in the initial phases of the combat, it is the initiates who deliver the final, killing blows to me drake. Scars from the hunt are considered a mark of pride among all aarakocra.</p><p>The females spend about eight months of the year incubating their eggs. Athasian aarakocra mate for life and a pair normally produces as many as 10 offspring. A female lays one egg a year. Constant incubation is not required because of the high daytime temperatures, so the females can maintain the nest and keep the tribe's treasure in order.</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Ecology:</b> Athasian aarakocra are high on the food chain and have no natural enemies other than <a href=\"/appendix/drakatha\">drakes</a>. Unless evil, aarakocra leave their own territory only to hunt the silt drake and return as soon as possible when the hunt is over. (Evil aarakocra attack others, as noted above.) Aarakocra eggs and hatchlings are sought after by wealthy land owners who wish to use the creatures as scouts and sentries. An egg can bring as much as 10 cp in Tyr's marketplace. Tribes that have had eggs or hatchlings stolen have long memories and sometimes take revenge against the thief at a later date. Captive aarakocra join any tribe they come in contact with.</p><p>Athasian aarakocra have a natural life span of 21-30 years.</p><p></p><br clear=\"all\" style=\"clear:both; height:0;\">\r\n","images":["<img src=\"grf/ds.gif\" width=\"150\" height=\"75\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Dark Sun\" title=\"Dark Sun\" align=\"right\">","<img src=\"img/aarakath.gif\" alt=\"Aarakocra (Athas)\" title=\"Aarakocra (Athas)\" border=\"0\" width=\"300\" height=\"360\" style=\"text-align:right;\" align=\"right\">","<img src=\"grf/add2_01.gif\" width=\"200\" height=\"56\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Advanced Dungeons & Dragons 2nd Edition\">"],"setting":"Dark Sun","statblock":{"Aarakocra (Athas)":{"Activity Cycle":"Day","Alignment":"Any","Armor Class":"7","Climate/Terrain":"Deep desert","Damage/Attack":"1d3/1d3 or by weapon","Diet":"Carnivore","Frequency":"Rare","Hit Dice":"2+2","Intelligence":"Average (8-10)","Magic Resistance":"Nil","Morale":"Steady (11)","Movement":"6, Fl 36 (C)","No. Appearing":"1d10","No. of Attacks":"2","Organization":"Tribal","Size":"M (20'+ wingspan)","Special Attacks":"Nil","Special Defenses":"Nil","THAC0":"17","Treasure":"Varies","XP Value":"65"}},"title":"Aarakocra (Athas)"},"sources":["2433"],"statblock_names":[],"title":"Aarakocra (Athas)","prev_key":"zygraat","next_key":"aarakocr","monster_path":"/appendix/aarakath"}}},"pageContext":{"monster_key":"karliki","monster_data":{"TSR":["TheLonesomeRoad"],"fullBody":"  <table cellspacing=\"0\" cellpadding=\"0\"><tr><th>Climate/Terrain:</th><td>Temperate hills and mountains (Barovia)</td></tr><tr><th>Frequency:</th><td>Rare</td></tr><tr><th>Organization:</th><td>Band</td></tr><tr><th>Activity Cycle:</th><td>Night</td></tr><tr><th>Diet:</th><td>Omnivore</td></tr><tr><th>Intelligence:</th><td>High (13-14)</td></tr><tr><th>Treasure:</th><td>M, Q (F)</td></tr><tr><th>Alignment:</th><td>Chaotic evil</td></tr><tr><th>No. Appearing:</th><td>4-24 (4d6)</td></tr><tr><th>Armor Class:</th><td>8 (Varies)</td></tr><tr><th>Movement:</th><td>6</td></tr><tr><th>Hit Dice:</th><td>1+1 (Varies)</td></tr><tr><th>THAC0:</th><td>20 (Varies)</td></tr><tr><th>No. of Attacks:</th><td>1</td></tr><tr><th>Damage/Attack:</th><td>By weapon</td></tr><tr><th>Special Attacks:</th><td>Nil</td></tr><tr><th>Special Defenses:</th><td>Nil</td></tr><tr><th>Magic Resistance:</th><td>15%</td></tr><tr><th>Size:</th><td>S (3½' tall)</td></tr><tr><th>Morale:</th><td>Unsteady (5-7)</td></tr><tr><th>XP Value:</th><td>120 (Varies)</td></tr></table><p class=\"f\"><i>The earth hides secrets very well, a fact that is not lost on the gods.</i></p><p><i>Andrei Tiszanov</i></p><p><br></p><p class=\"ni\">Frequently and incorrectly dubbed Barovian <a href=\"/appendix/dwarf\">dwarves</a> by outsiders, the fell karliki are among the more dangerous threats to travelers in the wilds of Barovia. These small folk dwell beneath the Balinok Mountains and their foothills, only emerging to prey upon lost travelers. In many ways, the karliki are the antithesis of dwarven races from other worlds - craven, impulsive, and sadistic.</p><p>Karliki are squat humanoids standing approximately three and a half feet tall. Their rough, callused skin is deep brown tending toward reddish tones. Their hair is gray throughout life, though it slowly changes from deep charcoal to a dirty ash-white as they age. Their unnerving eyes are featureless black orbs without irises or pupils. Their flat, grinding teeth are the color and hardness of iron. Both males and females grow beards, though only males have mustaches. Both sexes braid their whiskers into thick, stiff braids. Karliki favor clothing of simple, rough construction. They rarely dye or color their clothes, so earth tones are common. When hunting human flesh aboveground, karliki wear strong metal armor, featuring beautiful but terrifying designs.</p><p>Most Karliki know a few rudimentary phrases in Balok or Luktar, but make little effort to learn more. They speak their own bizarre tongue, which has an utterly alien alphabet. The sound of karliki speech is said to actually cause physical discomfort to other intelligent beings, and no sane person is capable of learning it.</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Combat:</b> Karliki are aggressive and unpredictable, but they are cowardly. They haunt the wild regions of Barovia in search of human prey, but never attack unless they possess a strong advantage. Lone, lost travelers are their favorite targets, but they are not above ambushing adventurers for their treasure or magic. Karliki know nothing of fair play; they use any dirty trick or craven tactic they can muster to slay their opponents.</p><p>Karliki have no natural weapons, relying on their skill at arms to slay opponents. Most wield broadswords (2d4 damage) or two-handed axes (1d10 damage). All karliki are considered specialized in their weapon of choice, and strike with a +1 bonus to hit and a +2 bonus to damage. Unlike dwarves, they disdain crossbows and other missile weapons. Unarmored karliki have an Armor Class of 8 due to their agility and tough skin. When moving about on the surface world, most karliki wear plate mail armor, which raises their AC to 2. Those wielding broadswords also carry shields (AC 1). Karliki armor is made of a dark iron-like metal with an oily sheen to it. It is frequently etched with depictions of demonic creatures, and is highly resistant to long-term corrosion, abuse and wear. The secrets of how to forge such armor, however, have not yet been wrested from the karliki. Like dwarves, karliki possess infravision, enabling them to see up to 60' in darkness.</p><p>Karliki hunting parties usually include around ten to twenty 1st-level fighters with the attributes listed above, which are led by a 3rd-5th level fighter. Though they do possess magic resistance, karliki are fully capable of using arcane magic. Roughly 15% of karliki encountered are fighter/mages, favoring the schools of Enchantment/Charm and Invocation/Evocation. Priests, however, are unknown among them.</p><p>The only natural weakness of the karliki is the sun; sunlight literally transforms them to stone in minutes. Three rounds of continuous exposure to direct sunlight will turn a karliki into a stone statue at the end of the third round. The sun must be clear of the horizon and unobscured by even the slightest cloud, however. Sunlight causes the karliki no damage or other hindrances before turning them to stone, and they are free to seek shelter while exposed to the sun's rays. Karliki are not affected by other light sources, which cause them no discomfort. Even magical sunlight, such as that produced by <i>sunray</i>, will not petrify them. A petrified karliki can only be restored to normal through a <i>stone to flesh</i> or <i>wish</i> spell.</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Habitat/Society:</b> Karliki are a frightening and mysterious folk. They dwell beneath the mountains and hills of Barovia, where they lead a dreary existence mining, working stone and metal, and studying magical secrets. They frequently emerge from their cthonic realms, however, to hunt humans for their flesh, which the karliki find tasty. They may also have some kind of spiteful grudge against mankind, for they seem to take a sadistic pleasure in slaying humans in a bloody fashion. They are said to laugh maniacally with every blow that bites into human flesh, and smear their faces with spilt blood while their fallen victims are still warm.</p><p>Little is known of karliki society beneath the earth. They organize themselves into tight familial clans, one of which always dominates a single subterranean enclave of one to two hundred karliki. Karliki society is insular and hateful, and the creatures destroy any weaker beings that encroach on their underground territory. They hate surface dwellers and the undead, but they freely associate with <a href=\"/appendix/lycawebd\">werebadgers</a>, sometimes deliberately allowing lycanthropy to spread among their kind. Karliki lust after wealth much like the dwarves they resemble, but they also hoard magic. They are not known to worship any gods.</p><p>Compared to the undead and lycanthropes that haunt the Barovian wilderness, the karliki might seem to be a relatively minor threat. Barovians have a healthy fear of them, however. While silver, holy symbols, garlic, and similar accoutrements might keep other supernatural horrors at bay, nothing short of a strong blade will help a wanderer faced with a karliki hunting party. The karliki never harm <a href=\"/appendix/humavist\">Vistani</a>, though, for reasons that neither party seems ready to divulge. Barovian legend says that the first karliki were angels who betrayed their patron gods. Their crimes were so heinous, however, that mere destruction or banishment was not sufficient. They were instead exiled to the Land of Mists, where they were forced to dwell beneath the earth to hide forever from the face of the sun.</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Ecology:</b> Karliki steadily mine the earth for its ores, gems, and other mineral wealth, but they hide themselves well from human miners and underground explorers. Some say that the karliki are simply clever enough to avoid areas that humans might discover, while others insist that they mask their subterranean passages with magic. Regardless, their underground enclaves are always far from human villages, frequently being constructed directly beneath torturous mountain passes. Karliki detest most foodstuffs that can be procured underground, emerging on the surface at night to hunt game (including humans) and gather fruits, roots, and other vegetables. When a karliki dies, its flesh and bones fall apart like crumbly stone, and then blow away like so much dust. Its possessions, however, remain behind. A few lucky smiths have thus managed to study the odd, dark metal used in karliki armor, but none have been able to reproduce it or smelt it for other purposes.</p><p><br></p><p class=\"ni\"><a href=\"http://webspace.webring.com/people/du/um_8226/monsters//appendix/karliki\">The Lonesome Road</a></p><br clear=\"all\" style=\"clear:both; height:0;\">\r\n","images":["<img src=\"grf/rv.gif\" width=\"150\" height=\"75\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Ravenloft\" title=\"Ravenloft\" align=\"right\">","<img src=\"grf/add2_01.gif\" width=\"200\" height=\"56\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Advanced Dungeons & Dragons 2nd Edition\">"],"setting":"Ravenloft","statblock":{"Karliki":{"Activity Cycle":"Night","Alignment":"Chaotic evil","Armor Class":"8 (Varies)","Climate/Terrain":"Temperate hills and mountains (Barovia)","Damage/Attack":"By weapon","Diet":"Omnivore","Frequency":"Rare","Hit Dice":"1+1 (Varies)","Intelligence":"High (13-14)","Magic Resistance":"15%","Morale":"Unsteady (5-7)","Movement":"6","No. Appearing":"4-24 (4d6)","No. of Attacks":"1","Organization":"Band","Size":"S (3½' tall)","Special Attacks":"Nil","Special Defenses":"Nil","THAC0":"20 (Varies)","Treasure":"M, Q (F)","XP Value":"120 (Varies)"}},"title":"Karliki"},"sources":["TheLonesomeRoad"],"statblock_names":[],"title":"Karliki","prev_key":"kappa","next_key":"kashehot","monster_path":"/appendix/karliki"}},"staticQueryHashes":[],"slicesMap":{}}
