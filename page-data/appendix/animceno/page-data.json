While the powers listed above are the most common, some aarakocra have different or additional powers.</p><p class=\"f\">A race of intelligent, birdlike creatures living in the deepest deserts of Athas, the rare Athasian <a href=\"/appendix/aarakocr\">aarakocra</a> spends its time soaring on thermals in search of food.</p><p>The aarakocra is 7 to 8 feet tall with a wingspan of 20 feet or more. Because of its large wingspan, an aarakocra can carry as much as 75% of its own body weight and still fly easily. An aarakocra can fly a short distance carrying a burden equaling 125% of its own body weight. The average body weight of a full grown male is 100 pounds and a female is 85 pounds.</p><p>Each wing has a &ldquo;hand&rdquo; at its midpoint, consisting of three fingers and an opposable thumb. The fourth finger forms the rigid leading edge of the wing. In flight the hands cannot be used, but on the ground the aarakocra can use its hands almost as a human would. The aarakocra's body is protected by a thin bony plate on the chest, much like a solid rib cage. Talons on its legs can be used as claws and can be retracted to reveal a second set of hands, also with three fingers and an opposable thumb. Except for the chest plate, the entire skeleton is hollow and extremely fragile.</p><p>From a distance, the Athasian aarakocra resembles a huge <a href=\"/appendix/bird\">vulture</a>. Its black eyes, set in the front of the head, provide excellent vision over a long range. The plumage is generally black with a white collar for adult males and black or brown with a smaller white collar for females. Adolescents are a mixture of brown and black. The beak is large and covers most of the head. Plumage begins at the crown of the head and is darker near the head, except for the collar. Athasian aarakocra speak their own language and the languages of vultures and other large birds. Some speak the common tongue (5% to 10% chance depending on how deep in the wastelands a tribe lives).</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Combat:</b> Aarakocra can fight in the air or on the ground. They prefer aerial combat since their bones are too fragile to withstand a solid blow from a human-sized opponent. In combat against creatures on the ground, they prefer to fly over their victim and drop weighted nets. Some aarakocra use darts to harass ground-based opponents.</p><p>If their opponents can fly, the aarakocra generally forgo the use of the net, although large groups sometimes use nets on flying creatures. Normally, aarakocra attack flying creatures with long spears, diving from above and allowing the momentum to carry the spear through the target. Such an attack doubles the damage if the aarakocra have been able to dive at least 50 feet. Only the very largest aarakocra can carry more than one of these spears, they can attack with both at once with no penalty, causing double damage on each strike. All diving attacks are made at +4 and should be treated as a charge attack. All other penalties and restrictions of charge attacks apply.</p><p>The effect of the aarakocra's nets depends on if the opponent is flying at the time it becomes entangled. Creatures on the ground that are hit by a net are entangled and unable to participate in any combat until they make a successful Strength check to get free of the net. Flying creatures hit by a net can no longer fly and immediately begin falling. If they cannot escape the net or use some magical means to arrest the fall, normal falling damage applies.</p><p>Unless victims are entangled in nets, aarakocra are cautious in ground combat. If the aarakocra outnumber their opponents they advance in a straight line and thrust with their spears. If outnumbered, or the opponents are particularly tough, the aarakocra withdraw. Victims entangled in nets are killed or incapacitated for use as food or ransom.</p><p>Athasian aarakocra are mindful of their physical limitations as well as their comparatively low psionic abilities. They do not normally initiate psionic combat. At the first sign of psionic powers from any of their victims, however, all aarakocra that have some ability will use whatever attack and defense modes they can in an attempt to destroy the threat. Large groups of is or more aarakocra may initiate psionic combat if their leaders feel they can win quickly and avoid physical combat.</p><p>In desperation, an aarakocra can attempt to bite an opponent in combat. Because of the unwieldiness of its beak, the aarakocra has a THAC0 of 18 if attacking with this appendage. Further, the birdman causes only 1d2 points of damage with the beak.</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Habitat/Society:</b> Athasian aarakocra live in tribes with 6-20 (2d8+4) members, depending on the prestige of the leader. The largest tribe ever recorded had 50 members. The tribal hunting territory depends on the size of the tribe, usually about 500 square miles for a tribe of 10 members. There are no rigid boundaries between tribes and border disputes are not uncommon.</p><p>Alignments of tribe members are similar to the alignment of the leader. A tribe that has a leader who is neutral good may have neutral good, chaotic good, lawful good, and true neutral members. A predominantly evil tribe does not recognize boundaries with other tribes and treats other tribes as inferior beings to be eliminated.</p><p>Athasian aarakocra aren't happy in enclosed spaces, but they they take refuge in a cave or building if necessary.</p><p>Nonevil tribes live in rocky aeries in the highest peaks they can find. Evil tribes are normally nomadic and use an aerie made by another tribe if they need to remain in an area for a long time, even if they have to evict the tribe that made the nest.</p><p>Aarakocra aren't friendly toward intruders in their territory, especially caravans. They try to extract a toll from the caravan for passage through the desert. Good-aligned tribes allow unhindered passage of caravans that pay a tribute. If someone refuses to pay the tribute, the aarakocra try to capture scouts or outriders from the party and hold them until an even larger tribute is paid. The payment may be either livestock or shiny objects. Aarakocra are smart enough not to be taken in by glass baubles instead of gems, although they cannot tell the difference between the more common gems and the rare ones.</p><p>Evil tribes ask for tribute and often attack a caravan whether it pays or not. Aarakocra always demand shiny objects such as stones. These tribes find humans and demihumans to be quite tasty and prefer them to other food.</p><p>Good-aligned tribes of aarakocra sometimes return a lost traveler to the edge of the desert after first removing any valuables the traveler may be carrying. On very rare occasions a tribe might return a lost group of travelers to the more frequently traveled parts of the desert, again after first taking any valuables as payment.</p><p>The oldest male is the leader of the tribal hunting party and has 4+4 Hit Dice. The oldest female is in charge of the tribal aerie and has 3+3 HD. In tribes that have more than 15 members, the next oldest aarakocra serves as shaman and has 3+3 HD; the shaman completes the triumvirate necessary for proper worship and the summoning of elementals. (Interestingly, no magic-using aarakocra has ever been recorded.) Tribes without a shaman cannot summon <a href=\"/appendix/element1\">air elementals</a>, which is an important part of aarakocra culture.</p><p>The shaman is the leader of the daily sun worship. Aarakocra worship the sun because it provides them with the thermals they need to soar in search of food. The shaman also leads the mystic rituals used to summon an air elemental. Summoning an air elemental is usually done only in preparation for the tribe's most sacred ceremony, the hunt. Small tribes must band together for this ceremony to allow the triumvirate to be formed.</p><p>The ceremony to summon an air elemental must be conducted at dawn and requires the oldest male and female to emit a highpitched keening whistle. The shaman conducts an intricate dance around them, simultaneously chanting an ancient summoning mantra.</p><p>The hunt is the final part of the initiation of adolescent aarakocra to adulthood and often takes the tribe far from their normal teritory. The target is always a <a href=\"/appendix/drakalsi\">silt drake</a>. The hunt is the only time the females leave the relative safety of the nest. Even an evil tribe will not interfere with a tribe on a hunt. An air elemental is often summoned to help find the drake, but never takes part in the actual combat. Although the adult members of the tribe take part in the initial phases of the combat, it is the initiates who deliver the final, killing blows to me drake. Scars from the hunt are considered a mark of pride among all aarakocra.</p><p>The females spend about eight months of the year incubating their eggs. Athasian aarakocra mate for life and a pair normally produces as many as 10 offspring. A female lays one egg a year. Constant incubation is not required because of the high daytime temperatures, so the females can maintain the nest and keep the tribe's treasure in order.</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Ecology:</b> Athasian aarakocra are high on the food chain and have no natural enemies other than <a href=\"/appendix/drakatha\">drakes</a>. Unless evil, aarakocra leave their own territory only to hunt the silt drake and return as soon as possible when the hunt is over. (Evil aarakocra attack others, as noted above.) Aarakocra eggs and hatchlings are sought after by wealthy land owners who wish to use the creatures as scouts and sentries. An egg can bring as much as 10 cp in Tyr's marketplace. Tribes that have had eggs or hatchlings stolen have long memories and sometimes take revenge against the thief at a later date. Captive aarakocra join any tribe they come in contact with.</p><p>Athasian aarakocra have a natural life span of 21-30 years.</p>\n","images":["<img src=\"grf/ds.gif\" width=\"150\" height=\"75\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Dark Sun\" title=\"Dark Sun\" align=\"right\">","<img src=\"img/aarakath.gif\" alt=\"Aarakocra (Athas)\" title=\"Aarakocra (Athas)\" border=\"0\" width=\"300\" height=\"360\" style=\"text-align:right;\" align=\"right\">","<img src=\"grf/add2_01.gif\" width=\"200\" height=\"56\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Advanced Dungeons & Dragons 2nd Edition\">"],"setting":"Dark Sun","statblock":{"Aarakocra (Athas)":{"Activity Cycle":"Day","Alignment":"Any","Armor Class":"7","Climate/Terrain":"Deep desert","Damage/Attack":"1d3/1d3 or by weapon","Diet":"Carnivore","Frequency":"Rare","Hit Dice":"2+2","Intelligence":"Average (8-10)","Magic Resistance":"Nil","Morale":"Steady (11)","Movement":"6, Fl 36 (C)","No. Appearing":"1d10","No. of Attacks":"2","Organization":"Tribal","Size":"M (20'+ wingspan)","Special Attacks":"Nil","Special Defenses":"Nil","THAC0":"17","Treasure":"Varies","XP Value":"65"}},"title":"Aarakocra (Athas)"},"sources":["2433"],"statblock_names":[],"title":"Aarakocra (Athas)","prev_key":"zygraat","next_key":"aarakocr","monster_path":"/appendix/aarakath"}}},"pageContext":{"monster_key":"animceno","monster_data":{"TSR":["Dragon167"],"fullBody":"    <table cellspacing=\"0\" cellpadding=\"0\"><tr class=\"bk\"><th> </th><th class=\"cn\">Agriotherium</th><th class=\"cn\">Amphicyon</th><th class=\"cn\">Anancus</th><th class=\"cn\">Andrewsarchus</th><th class=\"cn\">Camel, Giant</th><th class=\"cn\">Hippopotamus, giant</th><th class=\"cn\">Megalania</th><th class=\"cn\">Metridiochoerus</th><th class=\"cn\">Pelorovis</th><th class=\"cn\">Sarkastodon</th></tr><tr><th>Climate/Terrain:</th><td>Savannah</td><td>Temperate plains</td><td>Temperate forest</td><td>Temperate plains</td><td>Temperate plains</td><td>Tropical lakes and rivers</td><td>Savannah</td><td>Tropical forests</td><td>Savannah</td><td>Temperate plains</td></tr><tr><th>Frequency:</th><td>Uncommon</td><td>Uncommon</td><td>Common</td><td>Rare</td><td>Common</td><td>Rare</td><td>Rare</td><td>Mythical</td><td>Common</td><td>Uncommon</td></tr><tr><th>Organization:</th><td>Solitary</td><td>Solitary</td><td>Herd</td><td>Solitary</td><td>Herd</td><td>Family group</td><td>Solitary</td><td>Clan</td><td>Herd</td><td>Solitary</td></tr><tr><th>Activity Cycle:</th><td>Day</td><td>Day</td><td>Day</td><td>Day</td><td>Day</td><td>Special</td><td>Night</td><td>Family group</td><td>Special</td><td></td></tr><tr><th>Diet:</th><td>Omnivore</td><td>Omnivore</td><td>Herbivore</td><td>Carnivore</td><td>Herbivore</td><td>Special</td><td>Special</td><td>Omnivore</td><td>Special</td><td>Special</td></tr><tr><th>Intelligence:</th><td>Animal (1)</td><td>Animal (1)</td><td>Animal (1)</td><td>Animal (1)</td><td>Animal (1)</td><td>Non- (0)</td><td>Non- (0)</td><td>Animal (1)</td><td>Non- (0)</td><td>Non- (0)</td></tr><tr><th>Treasure:</th><td>Nil</td><td>Nil</td><td>Nil</td><td>Nil</td><td>Nil</td><td>Nil</td><td>Nil</td><td>Nil</td><td>Nil</td><td>Nil</td></tr><tr><th>Alignment:</th><td>Neutral</td><td>Neutral</td><td>Neutral</td><td>Neutral</td><td>Neutral</td><td>Neutral</td><td>Neutral</td><td>Neutral</td><td>Neutral</td><td>Neutral</td></tr><tr><th>No. Appearing:</th><td>1-2</td><td>1-2</td><td>2-20</td><td>1-2</td><td>1-20</td><td>1-4</td><td>1-4</td><td>1-10</td><td>4-40</td><td>1-2</td></tr><tr><th>Armor Class:</th><td>6</td><td>6</td><td>6</td><td>6</td><td>6</td><td>4</td><td>0</td><td>6</td><td>6/3</td><td>6</td></tr><tr><th>Movement:</th><td>15</td><td>15</td><td>15</td><td>15</td><td>15</td><td>6;

As the reptiles vanished, mammals expanded rapidly to occupy the vacant niches in the ecology. Cattle, antelope, and <a href=\"/appendix/horse\">horses</a> replaced the herbivorous duckbills, sauropods, and horned dinosaurs. <a href=\"/appendix/bear\">Bears</a>, <a href=\"/appendix/cat\">cats</a>, and <a href=\"/appendix/dog\">dogs</a> preyed on the new herbivores, since the carnivorous dinosaurs had died out. <a href=\"/appendix/whale\">Whales</a>, seals, and <a href=\"/appendix/dolphin\">dolphins</a> took to the seas to replace the <a href=\"/appendix/dinoaqua\">mosasaurs</a> and <a href=\"/appendix/dinoaqua\">plesiosaurs</a>. Only in the air did the mammals lose out, as <a href=\"/appendix/bird\">birds</a> largely replaced the pterosaurs.</p><p>The mammals' greatest asset is their flexibility. In time, they went far beyond the reptiles' capabilities and entered new environments, such as the high mountains and polar regions. Compared to dinosaurs and related creatures, mammals developed a variety of new forms very quickly.</p><p>The Cenozoic era was also the age of mammalian giants. Almost every family of land mammals existing today had giant relatives in the past. There were huge versions of bears, <a href=\"/appendix/catgreat\">lions</a>, <a href=\"/appendix/wolf\">wolves</a>, <a href=\"/appendix/hyena\">hyenas</a>, kangaroos, <a href=\"/appendix/mammsmal\">beavers</a>, apes, horses, <a href=\"/appendix/mammher2\">hippos</a>, <a href=\"/appendix/mammher2\">rhinos</a>, tapirs, deer, swine, and even dormice. After the last Ice Age, these giants vanished suddenly and in huge numbers. The cause of this mass extinction is just as mysterious as that of the dinosaurs earlier, but the result was not as devastating; mammals are still on top today.</p><p>This article supplements an earlier one, &ldquo;Into the Age of Mammals&rdquo; (Dragon issue #137), with descriptions of ancient animals that can be used in AD&D games. The creatures from both articles can be used in a prehistoric campaign, time-traveling adventures, or the normal campaign world. Additional statistics for prehistoric mammals and birds appear under <a href=\"/appendix/boar\">Boar</a>, <a href=\"/appendix/catgreat\">Cats, Great</a>, <a href=\"/appendix/elephant\">Elephant</a>, <a href=\"/appendix/hyena\">Hyena</a>, <a href=\"/appendix/pleianim\">Pleistocene Animal</a>, and <a href=\"/appendix/wolf\">Wolf</a>.</p><p>Scientific names can be clumsy to pronounce or might sound too modern for use in AD&D games. Alternate names have been given to each creature herein, as laymen in fantasy worlds might name them due to their appearance.</p><p>The Cenozoic era began 65 million years ago. It is divided into seven periods or epochs. From earliest to latest, they are: Paleocene, Eocene, Oligocene, Miocene, Pliocene, Pleistocene, and Holocene (Recent). The Pleistocene is noted for its Ice Age and the rise of early man.</p><p>It is not totally farfetched to include Cenozoic creatures in a medieval world. Some of these creatures survived into the historical world, where we barely missed seeing them. The moas, a species of giant flightless birds, survived in New Zealand until the late 1700s. Another giant, the elephant bird, may have lived into the 1600s on Madagascar. Sivatherium (see &ldquo;Into the Age of Mammals&rdquo;) died out in the Middle East at the beginning of civilization. The giant hippopotamus died out in Egypt at the beginning of that culture. Cuvieronius, a spiral-tusked mastodont that was the last of the American elephants, vanished around A.D. 400 in Argentina. The huge cave lion, the largest feline ever, died out in the Balkans around 100 B.C. The dire wolf, cave bear, ground sloth, and Irish deer all survived the end of the Ice Age, but died out soon thereafter, some only a few thousand years ago.</p><h2>Agriotherium (Savannah Bear)</h2><p class=\"f\">Although bears do not now live in Africa, Agriotherium roamed the southern African plains of the Pleistocene. Paleontologists are not sure how it got there; no other bear fossils have been found elsewhere south of the Sahara. Agriotherium was a huge, primitive bear, slightly smaller than the cave bear, with a doglike head.</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Combat:</b> Like other bears, Agriotherium strikes with two paws and a bite. If either paw hits with an 18 or better, it also hugs for 3-18 hp damage. It fights for 2-5 rounds at 0 to -10 hp, but dies instantly from greater damage.</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Habitat/Society:</b> All bears are solitary, pairing briefly only to mate. The mother raises the cubs alone. Agriotherium does not hibernate, due to its warm climate. Being at the top of the food chain and having no natural enemies, this bear can bring down large game that is sick or wounded, but it usually feeds on plants and small animals.</p><h2>Amphicyon (Bear Dog)</h2><p class=\"f\"><img src=\"/img/spc/amphcyon.gif\" width=\"300\" height=\"360\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Amphicyon\" style=\"float:left;\">Amphicyon giganteus was the largest of an early group of carnivores. It looked like a bear with a wolfish muzzle and canine tail.</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Combat:</b> Amphicyon is much like a bear in combat, striking with two paws and a bite (but no hug).</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Habitat/Society:</b> The bear dog is solitary and lives much like a grizzly bear. It feeds heavily on roots, wild fruit, and small animals. Unlike bears, however, it regularly attacks larger game, striking from ambush. Its prey includes the <a href=\"/appendix/pleianim\">titanothere</a> and hornless rhinoceros. Amphicyon is at the top of the food chain, having no natural enemies.</p><h2>Anancus (Pike-tusked Elephant)</h2><p class=\"f\"><img src=\"/img/spc/anancus.gif\" width=\"300\" height=\"360\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Anancus\" style=\"float:right;\">Anancus was an elephant adapted to woodland life. It had small ears, a small trunk, and two tremendously long (10') and straight tusks, almost as long as the animals body, that extended straight out in front of its mouth. Each tusk is worth 200-800 gp.</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Combat:</b> Anancus attacks with two tusks and both front legs. However, an opponent can be attacked by one tusk or both legs, not both tusks and legs at once.</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Habitat/Society:</b> Anancus is adapted to temperate forests, much as modern elephants roam open tropical forests. It feeds on tree and shrub foliage. Adults have no natural enemies except disease and tree blight (which destroys its habitat). The young may fall prey to large predators.</p><h2>Andrewsarchus (Giant Long-jawed Hyena)</h2><p class=\"f\"><img src=\"/img/spc/andrsarc.gif\" width=\"300\" height=\"360\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Andrewsarchus\" style=\"float:left;\">Andrewsarchus was the largest known carnivorous land mammal. Unrelated to any modern or past carnivore, it was more closely related to the animals it fed upon than anything else. Andrewsarchus looked vaguely like a hyena but had a huge skull nearly 3? long. Its tail appeared feline.</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Combat:</b> Andrewsarchus can attack with its strong jaws, but prefers to feed on carrion.</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Habitat/Society:</b> Large carnivores are usually solitary, and Andrewsarchus is no exception, pairing only once a year to mate. It is mainly a scavenger but can attack large game, including Coryphodon and Uintatherium (see &ldquo;Into the Age of Mammals&rdquo; for details), as well as hornless rhinos and tapirs. This beast is at the top of the food chain, having no enemies.</p><h2>Bears</h2><p class=\"f\">Bears are successful carnivores of Pleistocene to Recent times. Several are described <a href=\"/appendix/bear\">here</a>, but there is one glaring error. The cave bear was the largest bear ever, while the polar bear is much smaller. Thus, the statistics for the cave bear and the polar bear should be switched. The Kodiak brown bear is roughly equal to the polar bear, averaging slightly larger. The black bear statistics are fine as is and can also represent several species of tropical bears. The short-faced bear (see &ldquo;Into the Age of Mammals&rdquo;) is an odd-looking relative from the Ice Age.</p><h2>Camel, giant</h2><p class=\"f\">The giant <a href=\"/appendix/camel\">camel</a> looked much like modern species, except that it did not have a fatty hump. It was a grazer on Pleistocene plains, standing taller than the mastodons around it. If domesticated, the giant camel can carry up to 800 lbs. at full speed or 1,600 lbs. at half speed.</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Combat:</b> The giant camel attacks with a bite or two hooves, but cannot use both in one round.</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Habitat/Society:</b> Giant camels live in herds on temperate prairies, with habits similar to other herd animals. They tend to flee predators who come too close, but otherwise ignore them. As large herbivores, giant camels occupy a middle niche in the food chain. The young are taken by many carnivores, but only large carnivores can bring down an adult.</p><h2>Elephant, dwarf</h2><p class=\"f\">While giant versions of many mammals lived in the Cenozoic, this elephant went the opposite route. Inhabiting only isolated wooded islands in the Mediterranean and Java, the dwarf elephant looked much like any other elephant, just smaller.</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Combat:</b> The dwarf elephant uses only its tusks in combat, as it is too small to use its feet or trunk.</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Habitat/Society:</b> Dwarf elephants live in herds and browse on tree and shrub foliage. In spite of their size, they are used to being the largest creatures on their isolated islands, and no large predators bother them. When confronted by men and other larger creatures, they prefer to run. If sold, the tusks are worth 10-100 gp each. This elephant is the ancestor of the <a href=\"/appendix/mammmini\">minimal elephants</a>.</p><h2>Eucladoceros</h2><p class=\"f\">This giant forest deer is equal to the <a href=\"/appendix/stag\">giant stag</a>. However, Eucladoceros has a huge antler array with numerous tines; its antler damage is 3-18 hp damage.</p><h2>Hippopotamus, giant</h2><p class=\"f\">This massive animal is the direct ancestor of the behemoth but has two differences, detailed below.</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Combat:</b> First, the giant hippo has smaller tusks than the behemoth, doing only 5-20 hp damage (4-16 for females). Second, the giant hippo has eyes that stick up above the skull like periscopes. Thus, it can hide its entire body below the water, with only its eyes above the surface. This gives it a -2 modifier to surprise rolls against swimmers and boats.</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Habitat/Society:</b> When a group is encountered, it will typically be one male (bull) and 1-3 females (cows). Only the young are subject to attack, and only by the largest predators.</p><h2>Marsupials</h2><p class=\"f\">Pouched mammals are primitive and relatively unsuccessful, usually being confined to isolated lands (except for the opossum). Before modern placental mammals took over the world, marsupials developed into a variety of forms, some very similar to other mammals, such as lions, bears, wolves, tapirs, and even sabertooth cats. Unique marsupials included 10'-tall kangaroos and rhino-sized wombats. The DM can create a Pleistocene version of Australia with these creatures and perhaps a human aboriginal culture. Whatever the final result, this land will be an odd and unique place.</p><h2>Megalania (Giant Plains Lizard)</h2><p class=\"f\">Megalania was not a mammal, but a giant lizard that hunted on the Pleistocene plains of Australia. It looked much like modern monitor lizards and the Komodo dragon, having long, serrated teeth.</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Combat:</b> The giant plains lizard attacks with its bite. Like other giant lizards, the bite does double damage on an attack roll of 20. Anyone behind the lizard can be attacked by a slash of its tail, doing 2-5 hp damage and being knocked down if a dexterity check on 4d6 is failed.</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Habitat/Society:</b> Megalania is a solitary hunter, inactive at night and during the hottest hours of the day. It ambushes its prey from concealing grass and shrubs. As with most reptiles, the young are left to fend for themselves, receiving no care from the parents. The giant plains lizard is at the top of the food chain, having no natural enemies.</p><h2>Metridiochoerus (Giant Warthog)</h2><p class=\"f\">Metridiochoerus was a giant warthog and a contemporary of the earliest humans. It had the same squat body and long head as the modern species. Its tusks were long and sharp.</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Combat:</b> The giant warthog fights with slashes from its two sets of tusks. Females are equal to males. This swine fights for 1-3 rounds at 0 to -8 hp, but greater damage kills it instantly. (Those who do not think pigs are dangerous should rent the video Razorback.)</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Habitat/Society:</b> Giant warthogs live in family groups. If more than one is encountered, the largest is the male, while the others are females (50%) and young (50%). Normally rooters and browsers, warthogs also eat carrion and small animals. Giant warthogs are in the middle of the food chain. The young fall prey to many predators, while lions can take the adults.</p><h2>Pelorovis (Long-horned Buffalo)</h2><p class=\"f\">This was a close relative of the modern African buffalo and looked much like it. However, Pelorovis had huge horns, curving out to the sides and down to form a half circle. The total horn span could reach 12'.</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Combat:</b> Pelorovis fights with its massive horns. If it can charge at least 40', it inflicts 5-20 hp damage, automatically knocking down any human-sized opponent, and tramples for an additional 2-5 hp damage.</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Habitat/Society:</b> Pelorovis lives in large herds like other African herbivores. It roams the open woodland scrub, not the jungle or bare plains. The females are smaller, equal to normal buffalo. Only lions can bring down an adult. Females and young fall to hyenas, leopards, and <a href=\"/appendix/crocodil\">crocodiles</a>.</p><h2>Sarkastodon (Long-tailed Bear)</h2><p class=\"f\">This carnivore was the largest of the creodonts, an early order of carnivores that included <a href=\"/appendix/hyena\">Hyaenodon</a>. Sarkastodon looked much like a bear with a long tail; it was larger than even the cave bear.</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Combat:</b> Sarkastodon fights with its paws and a bite.</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Habitat/Society:</b> Sarkastodon is a solitary predator, living much like a bear. Its prey includes titanotheres and rhinoceroses, but it also feeds on roots, wild fruit, and rodents. Sarkastodon is at the top of the food chain, having no natural enemies.</p>\n","images":["<img src=\"grf/dr.gif\" width=\"150\" height=\"75\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Dragon Magazine\" title=\"Dragon Magazine\" align=\"right\">","<img src=\"/img/spc/amphcyon.gif\" width=\"300\" height=\"360\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Amphicyon\" style=\"float:left;\">","<img src=\"/img/spc/anancus.gif\" width=\"300\" height=\"360\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Anancus\" style=\"float:right;\">","<img src=\"/img/spc/andrsarc.gif\" width=\"300\" height=\"360\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Andrewsarchus\" style=\"float:left;\">","<img src=\"grf/add2_01.gif\" width=\"200\" height=\"56\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Advanced Dungeons & Dragons 2nd Edition\">"],"setting":"Dragon Magazine","statblock":{"Agriotherium":{"Activity Cycle":"Day","Alignment":"Neutral","Armor Class":"6","Climate/Terrain":"Savannah","Damage/Attack":"1-10/1-10/1-10","Diet":"Omnivore","Frequency":"Uncommon","Hit Dice":"8","Intelligence":"Animal (1)","Magic Resistance":"Nil","Morale":"Average (8-10)","Movement":"15","No. Appearing":"1-2","No. of Attacks":"3","Organization":"Solitary","Size":"L (10' high)","Special Attacks":"Hug","Special Defenses":"Nil","THAC0":"13","Treasure":"Nil","XP Value":"2,000"},"Amphicyon":{"Activity Cycle":"Day","Alignment":"Neutral","Armor Class":"6","Climate/Terrain":"Temperate plains","Damage/Attack":"2-8/2-8/1-8","Diet":"Omnivore","Frequency":"Uncommon","Hit Dice":"7+7","Intelligence":"Animal (1)","Magic Resistance":"Nil","Morale":"Average (8-10)","Movement":"15","No. Appearing":"1-2","No. of Attacks":"3","Organization":"Solitary","Size":"M (6½' long)","Special Attacks":"Nil","Special Defenses":"Nil","THAC0":"13","Treasure":"Nil","XP Value":"650"},"Anancus":{"Activity Cycle":"Day","Alignment":"Neutral","Armor Class":"6","Climate/Terrain":"Temperate forest","Damage/Attack":"3-18/3-18/2-12/2-12","Diet":"Herbivore","Frequency":"Common","Hit Dice":"10+5","Intelligence":"Animal (1)","Magic Resistance":"Nil","Morale":"Unsteady (5-7)","Movement":"15","No. Appearing":"2-20","No. of Attacks":"4","Organization":"Herd","Size":"L (10' high)","Special Attacks":"Nil","Special Defenses":"Nil","THAC0":"9","Treasure":"Nil","XP Value":"2,000"},"Andrewsarchus":{"Activity Cycle":"Day","Alignment":"Neutral","Armor Class":"6","Climate/Terrain":"Temperate plains","Damage/Attack":"3-18","Diet":"Carnivore","Frequency":"Rare","Hit Dice":"9+9","Intelligence":"Animal (1)","Magic Resistance":"Nil","Morale":"Steady (11-12)","Movement":"15","No. Appearing":"1-2","No. of Attacks":"1","Organization":"Solitary","Size":"L (13' long)","Special Attacks":"Nil","Special Defenses":"Nil","THAC0":"11","Treasure":"Nil","XP Value":"1,400"},"Camel, Giant":{"Activity Cycle":"Day","Alignment":"Neutral","Armor Class":"6","Climate/Terrain":"Temperate plains","Damage/Attack":"1-6 or 2-8/2-8","Diet":"Herbivore","Frequency":"Common","Hit Dice":"7","Intelligence":"Animal (1)","Magic Resistance":"Nil","Morale":"Unreliable (3)","Movement":"15","No. Appearing":"1-20","No. of Attacks":"1 or 2","Organization":"Herd","Size":"L (11' tall)","Special Attacks":"Nil","Special Defenses":"Nil","THAC0":"13","Treasure":"Nil","XP Value":"420"},"Hippopotamus, giant":{"Activity Cycle":"Special","Alignment":"Neutral","Armor Class":"4","Climate/Terrain":"Tropical lakes and rivers","Damage/Attack":"5-20 or 4-16","Diet":"Special","Frequency":"Rare","Hit Dice":"10+5","Intelligence":"Non- (0)","Magic Resistance":"Nil","Morale":"Unsteady (7)","Movement":"6;
