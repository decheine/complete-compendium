While the powers listed above are the most common, some aarakocra have different or additional powers.</p><p class=\"f\">A race of intelligent, birdlike creatures living in the deepest deserts of Athas, the rare Athasian <a href=\"/appendix/aarakocr\">aarakocra</a> spends its time soaring on thermals in search of food.</p><p>The aarakocra is 7 to 8 feet tall with a wingspan of 20 feet or more. Because of its large wingspan, an aarakocra can carry as much as 75% of its own body weight and still fly easily. An aarakocra can fly a short distance carrying a burden equaling 125% of its own body weight. The average body weight of a full grown male is 100 pounds and a female is 85 pounds.</p><p>Each wing has a &ldquo;hand&rdquo; at its midpoint, consisting of three fingers and an opposable thumb. The fourth finger forms the rigid leading edge of the wing. In flight the hands cannot be used, but on the ground the aarakocra can use its hands almost as a human would. The aarakocra's body is protected by a thin bony plate on the chest, much like a solid rib cage. Talons on its legs can be used as claws and can be retracted to reveal a second set of hands, also with three fingers and an opposable thumb. Except for the chest plate, the entire skeleton is hollow and extremely fragile.</p><p>From a distance, the Athasian aarakocra resembles a huge <a href=\"/appendix/bird\">vulture</a>. Its black eyes, set in the front of the head, provide excellent vision over a long range. The plumage is generally black with a white collar for adult males and black or brown with a smaller white collar for females. Adolescents are a mixture of brown and black. The beak is large and covers most of the head. Plumage begins at the crown of the head and is darker near the head, except for the collar. Athasian aarakocra speak their own language and the languages of vultures and other large birds. Some speak the common tongue (5% to 10% chance depending on how deep in the wastelands a tribe lives).</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Combat:</b> Aarakocra can fight in the air or on the ground. They prefer aerial combat since their bones are too fragile to withstand a solid blow from a human-sized opponent. In combat against creatures on the ground, they prefer to fly over their victim and drop weighted nets. Some aarakocra use darts to harass ground-based opponents.</p><p>If their opponents can fly, the aarakocra generally forgo the use of the net, although large groups sometimes use nets on flying creatures. Normally, aarakocra attack flying creatures with long spears, diving from above and allowing the momentum to carry the spear through the target. Such an attack doubles the damage if the aarakocra have been able to dive at least 50 feet. Only the very largest aarakocra can carry more than one of these spears, they can attack with both at once with no penalty, causing double damage on each strike. All diving attacks are made at +4 and should be treated as a charge attack. All other penalties and restrictions of charge attacks apply.</p><p>The effect of the aarakocra's nets depends on if the opponent is flying at the time it becomes entangled. Creatures on the ground that are hit by a net are entangled and unable to participate in any combat until they make a successful Strength check to get free of the net. Flying creatures hit by a net can no longer fly and immediately begin falling. If they cannot escape the net or use some magical means to arrest the fall, normal falling damage applies.</p><p>Unless victims are entangled in nets, aarakocra are cautious in ground combat. If the aarakocra outnumber their opponents they advance in a straight line and thrust with their spears. If outnumbered, or the opponents are particularly tough, the aarakocra withdraw. Victims entangled in nets are killed or incapacitated for use as food or ransom.</p><p>Athasian aarakocra are mindful of their physical limitations as well as their comparatively low psionic abilities. They do not normally initiate psionic combat. At the first sign of psionic powers from any of their victims, however, all aarakocra that have some ability will use whatever attack and defense modes they can in an attempt to destroy the threat. Large groups of is or more aarakocra may initiate psionic combat if their leaders feel they can win quickly and avoid physical combat.</p><p>In desperation, an aarakocra can attempt to bite an opponent in combat. Because of the unwieldiness of its beak, the aarakocra has a THAC0 of 18 if attacking with this appendage. Further, the birdman causes only 1d2 points of damage with the beak.</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Habitat/Society:</b> Athasian aarakocra live in tribes with 6-20 (2d8+4) members, depending on the prestige of the leader. The largest tribe ever recorded had 50 members. The tribal hunting territory depends on the size of the tribe, usually about 500 square miles for a tribe of 10 members. There are no rigid boundaries between tribes and border disputes are not uncommon.</p><p>Alignments of tribe members are similar to the alignment of the leader. A tribe that has a leader who is neutral good may have neutral good, chaotic good, lawful good, and true neutral members. A predominantly evil tribe does not recognize boundaries with other tribes and treats other tribes as inferior beings to be eliminated.</p><p>Athasian aarakocra aren't happy in enclosed spaces, but they they take refuge in a cave or building if necessary.</p><p>Nonevil tribes live in rocky aeries in the highest peaks they can find. Evil tribes are normally nomadic and use an aerie made by another tribe if they need to remain in an area for a long time, even if they have to evict the tribe that made the nest.</p><p>Aarakocra aren't friendly toward intruders in their territory, especially caravans. They try to extract a toll from the caravan for passage through the desert. Good-aligned tribes allow unhindered passage of caravans that pay a tribute. If someone refuses to pay the tribute, the aarakocra try to capture scouts or outriders from the party and hold them until an even larger tribute is paid. The payment may be either livestock or shiny objects. Aarakocra are smart enough not to be taken in by glass baubles instead of gems, although they cannot tell the difference between the more common gems and the rare ones.</p><p>Evil tribes ask for tribute and often attack a caravan whether it pays or not. Aarakocra always demand shiny objects such as stones. These tribes find humans and demihumans to be quite tasty and prefer them to other food.</p><p>Good-aligned tribes of aarakocra sometimes return a lost traveler to the edge of the desert after first removing any valuables the traveler may be carrying. On very rare occasions a tribe might return a lost group of travelers to the more frequently traveled parts of the desert, again after first taking any valuables as payment.</p><p>The oldest male is the leader of the tribal hunting party and has 4+4 Hit Dice. The oldest female is in charge of the tribal aerie and has 3+3 HD. In tribes that have more than 15 members, the next oldest aarakocra serves as shaman and has 3+3 HD; the shaman completes the triumvirate necessary for proper worship and the summoning of elementals. (Interestingly, no magic-using aarakocra has ever been recorded.) Tribes without a shaman cannot summon <a href=\"/appendix/element1\">air elementals</a>, which is an important part of aarakocra culture.</p><p>The shaman is the leader of the daily sun worship. Aarakocra worship the sun because it provides them with the thermals they need to soar in search of food. The shaman also leads the mystic rituals used to summon an air elemental. Summoning an air elemental is usually done only in preparation for the tribe's most sacred ceremony, the hunt. Small tribes must band together for this ceremony to allow the triumvirate to be formed.</p><p>The ceremony to summon an air elemental must be conducted at dawn and requires the oldest male and female to emit a highpitched keening whistle. The shaman conducts an intricate dance around them, simultaneously chanting an ancient summoning mantra.</p><p>The hunt is the final part of the initiation of adolescent aarakocra to adulthood and often takes the tribe far from their normal teritory. The target is always a <a href=\"/appendix/drakalsi\">silt drake</a>. The hunt is the only time the females leave the relative safety of the nest. Even an evil tribe will not interfere with a tribe on a hunt. An air elemental is often summoned to help find the drake, but never takes part in the actual combat. Although the adult members of the tribe take part in the initial phases of the combat, it is the initiates who deliver the final, killing blows to me drake. Scars from the hunt are considered a mark of pride among all aarakocra.</p><p>The females spend about eight months of the year incubating their eggs. Athasian aarakocra mate for life and a pair normally produces as many as 10 offspring. A female lays one egg a year. Constant incubation is not required because of the high daytime temperatures, so the females can maintain the nest and keep the tribe's treasure in order.</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Ecology:</b> Athasian aarakocra are high on the food chain and have no natural enemies other than <a href=\"/appendix/drakatha\">drakes</a>. Unless evil, aarakocra leave their own territory only to hunt the silt drake and return as soon as possible when the hunt is over. (Evil aarakocra attack others, as noted above.) Aarakocra eggs and hatchlings are sought after by wealthy land owners who wish to use the creatures as scouts and sentries. An egg can bring as much as 10 cp in Tyr's marketplace. Tribes that have had eggs or hatchlings stolen have long memories and sometimes take revenge against the thief at a later date. Captive aarakocra join any tribe they come in contact with.</p><p>Athasian aarakocra have a natural life span of 21-30 years.</p><br clear=\"all\" style=\"clear:both; height:0;\">\r\n","images":["<img src=\"grf/ds.gif\" width=\"150\" height=\"75\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Dark Sun\" title=\"Dark Sun\" align=\"right\">","<img src=\"img/aarakath.gif\" alt=\"Aarakocra (Athas)\" title=\"Aarakocra (Athas)\" border=\"0\" width=\"300\" height=\"360\" style=\"text-align:right;\" align=\"right\">","<img src=\"grf/add2_01.gif\" width=\"200\" height=\"56\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Advanced Dungeons & Dragons 2nd Edition\">"],"setting":"Dark Sun","statblock":{"Aarakocra (Athas)":{"Activity Cycle":"Day","Alignment":"Any","Armor Class":"7","Climate/Terrain":"Deep desert","Damage/Attack":"1d3/1d3 or by weapon","Diet":"Carnivore","Frequency":"Rare","Hit Dice":"2+2","Intelligence":"Average (8-10)","Magic Resistance":"Nil","Morale":"Steady (11)","Movement":"6, Fl 36 (C)","No. Appearing":"1d10","No. of Attacks":"2","Organization":"Tribal","Size":"M (20'+ wingspan)","Special Attacks":"Nil","Special Defenses":"Nil","THAC0":"17","Treasure":"Varies","XP Value":"65"}},"title":"Aarakocra (Athas)"},"sources":["2433"],"statblock_names":[],"title":"Aarakocra (Athas)","prev_key":"zygraat","next_key":"aarakocr","monster_path":"/appendix/aarakath"}}},"pageContext":{"monster_key":"thrikree","monster_data":{"TSR":["2140","2433"],"fullBody":"  <table cellspacing=\"0\" cellpadding=\"0\"><tr><th>Climate/Terrain:</th><td>Any land (Temperate or tropical arid land)</td></tr><tr><th>Frequency:</th><td>Uncommon</td></tr><tr><th>Organization:</th><td>Clutch and pack</td></tr><tr><th>Activity Cycle:</th><td>Constant</td></tr><tr><th>Diet:</th><td>Carnivore</td></tr><tr><th>Intelligence:</th><td>Average to high (8-14)</td></tr><tr><th>Treasure:</th><td>Varies</td></tr><tr><th>Alignment:</th><td>Chaotic neutral</td></tr><tr><th>No. Appearing:</th><td>2d12</td></tr><tr><th>Armor Class:</th><td>5</td></tr><tr><th>Movement:</th><td>18</td></tr><tr><th>Hit Dice:</th><td>6+3</td></tr><tr><th>THAC0:</th><td>13</td></tr><tr><th>No. of Attacks:</th><td>5 or 2</td></tr><tr><th>Damage/Attack:</th><td>1d4 (&times;4)/1d4+1, or 1d4+1 and by weapon</td></tr><tr><th>Special Attacks:</th><td>Paralyzation</td></tr><tr><th>Special Defenses:</th><td>Missile dodge</td></tr><tr><th>Magic Resistance:</th><td>Nil</td></tr><tr><th>Size:</th><td>L (11' long)</td></tr><tr><th>Morale:</th><td>Fanatic (17-18)</td></tr><tr><th>XP Value:</th><td>1,400</td></tr></table><p class=\"f\"><img src=\"/img/spc/thrikre2.gif\" width=\"300\" height=\"360\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Thri-kreen\" title=\"Thri-kreen\" style=\"float:left; margin-right:.5em;\">The figures given above are for mature adult thri-kreen.

They are found in most areas of Athas and they prefer to roam the plains where they have hunting territorres. Thri-kreen have no need of sleep and can remain active through the day and night.</p><p>Mature adult thri-kreen are 7 feet tall at the shoulder and 11 feet long. Six limbs protrude from their midsection, two are used for walking and the other four end in hands. The tough, sandy-yellow exoskeleton is extremely hard. A thri-kreen has two compound eyes, usually black with highlighted eyespots, two antennae, and a complicated jaw structure that manipulates food as the thri-kreen chews. The antennae help the individual to maneuver through brush and grasslands in the darkness (they also lessen any melee combat penalty from darkness or blindness by 1; missile combat is not affected). Thri-kreen often wear harnesses and even some forms of clothing, but they never wear armor.</p><p>The two subspecies of thri-kreen found in the Tyr Region are the jeral and the to'ksa. Jeral have short necks and antennae. Their hands each have three fingers and the shells of their abdomens are segmented. To'ksa have four-fingered hands, long necks, and long antennae They also have a long, solid shell that covers the top of the abdomen, and a thin layer of skin that covers the rest of their chitin.</p><p>The thri-kreen native language uses several sounds found in humanoid languages, but also uses clicks and grinding sounds. While it is difficult for other creatures to speak this tongue, it is just as difficult for thri-kreen to imitate more standard speech patterns. Thri-kreen speak their own language, but some (perhaps 30%) understand common.</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Combat:</b> The majority of thri-kreen are hunters, concerned primarily with finding enough prey to support the pack. Thri-kreen hunters seldom attack other sentient beings for food, but will defend themselves if attacked. Some thri-kreen have strayed from hunting and have begun raiding, these thri-kreen are the scourge of all other creatures. Thri-kreen attack in a well-coordinated group, generally weakening their enemies with psionics and missile weapons before engaging in melee. They also stalk prey and are relentless in their pursuit. Because thri-kreen do not sleep, their ability in siege combat is superior. A raiding party can continue an assault long after their opponents have tired. Though thri-kreen can win most battles by force, they win some through attrition and endurance.</p><p>The thri-kreens' chitinous exoskeletons give them AC 5 naturally. Thri-kreen are immune to <i>charm person</i> and <i>hold person</i> spells. Unarmed, thri-kreen can attack with 4 claws and 1 bite attack per round. If using a weapon, thri-kreen can attack with weapon and bite. The gythka, a polearm with a blade at each end, can slash for 1-6 (1d6) points of damage against man-sized or smaller targets, or 1-10 (1d10) points of damage against larger targets. The gythka can be thrown as a spear to inflict 3.8 (1d6+2) points of damage. Thri-kreen also learn special combat maneuvers as they grow older, learning all by the time they are mature adults.</p><p><i>Leap:</i> This ability allows thri-kreen to leap 20 feet straight up or 50 feet forward. They cannot leap backward.</p><p><i>Chatkcha:</i> This is a crystalline throwing wedge. A thri-kreen can throw 2 chatkcha per round, as far as 270 feet. A chatkcha causes 3-8 (1d6+2) points of damage when it hits, and returns to the thrower when it misses. Generally, only adult thri-kreen use the chatkcha. The thri-kreen ceremony of adulthood is associated with the chatkcha.</p><p><i>Venom:</i> This venom is delivered through an older thri-kreen's bite. Anyone bitten must make a successful save vs. paralyzation or be paralyzed. Smaller than man-sized creatures are paralyzed for 2-20 (2d10) rounds, man-sized for 2-16 (2d8) rounds, large creatures for 1-8 (1d8) rounds, and huge and gargantuan creatures for only 1 round.</p><p><i>Dodge missiles:</i> A mature thri-kreen can dodge missiles fired at it with a roll of 9 or better on 1d20; they cannot dodge magical effects, only physical missiles. Magical physical missiles (arrows, thrown axes) modify this roll by their magical bonus.</p><p><i>Psionics:</i> Some thri-kreen have psionic wild talents. There is a 50% chance that any thri-kreen will have a psionic wild talent, described in <i>The Complete Psionics Handbook</i>.</p><p><i>Magical items:</i> Thri-kreen can use most magical items, though those designed for humanoid creatures cannot be worn properly, so do not function for a thri-kreen.</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Habitat/Society:</b> Thri-kreen hatch from eggs. Those who hatch from the same group of eggs are considered a clutch. The bond of a clutchmate goes beyond family or friendship. When thri-kreen enter humanoid society. they still feel compelled to belong to a clutch and often accept humanoids as clutchmates.</p><p>In their natural habitats thri-kreen organize into hunting packs. There are no permanent thri-kreen communities. Each pack consists of several clutches and ranges over a wide territory that the pack considers to be theirs for purposes of hunting. Small packs consist only of mature adults. Packs of more than eight thri-kreen are about two-thirds mature adults and one-third other age categories (in about equal numbers).</p><p>Thri-kreen clutches and packs are organized along a strict order of dominance. The toughest member is the leader, the second most powerful is the second in command, and so forth. A thri-kreen can challenge a superior for dominance, initiating a contest. The combatants fight until one surrenders or dies. Afterward, the matter is settled and there are no lingering resentments, because all thri-kreen agree that a strong leader makes a strong pack. The challenger is doing what is best for the pack, not seeking personal gain, and after a challenge, both individuals can go about their business, confident of their status within the group.</p><p>When thri-kreen are not engaged in hunting, they make and repair weapons, teach skills to their young, and create works of art, usually sculpture. Thri-kreen also decorate their chitin with etchings or sometimes paints. Thri-kreen also pride themselves in the quality of their weapons, especially the chatkcha. Many chatkcha are decorative as well as functional and have designs carved into them. Some chatkcha become heirlooms and are passed on from generation to generation within a pack. If an heirloom chatkcha is lost or stolen, thri-kreen consider it a point of honor to recover it.</p><p>Thri-kreen are monogamous and never betray the bond between mates. Mating usually takes place late in the year at the time of the ascending sun. From 10-30 eggs are laid approximately 30 days later. Eggs not eaten by predators hatch about 60 days later. Thri-kreen advance one age category per year until they become mature adults. A thrikreen seldom lives for more than 35 years.</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Ecology:</b> Thri-kreen are carnivores. They seldom hunt other intelligent creatures for food, but will do so in times of need. Mantis warriors have a well-known taste for <a href=\"/appendix/elfathas\">elves</a>, which keeps both races at an uneasy peace at best. When raiding instead of simply hunting, thri-kreen are rarely interested in items with monetary value, usually concentrating on those things they can eat. Thri-kreen packs carry little that could be considered treasure, though their weapons and tools are considered valuable by some. Thri-kreen chitin can also be used for armor by humanoids if care is taken.</p><br clear=\"all\" style=\"clear:both; height:0;\">\r\n","images":["<img src=\"grf/ds.gif\" width=\"150\" height=\"75\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Dark Sun\" title=\"Dark Sun\" align=\"right\">","<img src=\"img/thrikree.gif\" alt=\"Thri-kreen\" title=\"Thri-kreen\" border=\"0\" width=\"300\" height=\"360\" style=\"text-align:right;\" align=\"right\">","<img src=\"/img/spc/thrikre2.gif\" width=\"300\" height=\"360\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Thri-kreen\" title=\"Thri-kreen\" style=\"float:left; margin-right:.5em;\">","<img src=\"grf/add2_01.gif\" width=\"200\" height=\"56\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Advanced Dungeons & Dragons 2nd Edition\">"],"setting":"Dark Sun","statblock":{"Thri-kreen":{"Activity Cycle":"Constant","Alignment":"Chaotic neutral","Armor Class":"5","Climate/Terrain":"Any land (Temperate or tropical arid land)","Damage/Attack":"1d4 (&times;4)/1d4+1, or 1d4+1 and by weapon","Diet":"Carnivore","Frequency":"Uncommon","Hit Dice":"6+3","Intelligence":"Average to high (8-14)","Magic Resistance":"Nil","Morale":"Fanatic (17-18)","Movement":"18","No. Appearing":"2d12","No. of Attacks":"5 or 2","Organization":"Clutch and pack","Size":"L (11' long)","Special Attacks":"Paralyzation","Special Defenses":"Missile dodge","THAC0":"13","Treasure":"Varies","XP Value":"1,400"}},"title":"Thri-kreen"},"sources":["2140","2433"],"statblock_names":[],"title":"Thri-kreen","prev_key":"thrax","next_key":"thunchil","monster_path":"/appendix/thrikree"}},"staticQueryHashes":[],"slicesMap":{}}
