While the powers listed above are the most common, some aarakocra have different or additional powers.</p><p class=\"f\">A race of intelligent, birdlike creatures living in the deepest deserts of Athas, the rare Athasian <a href=\"/appendix/aarakocr\">aarakocra</a> spends its time soaring on thermals in search of food.</p><p>The aarakocra is 7 to 8 feet tall with a wingspan of 20 feet or more. Because of its large wingspan, an aarakocra can carry as much as 75% of its own body weight and still fly easily. An aarakocra can fly a short distance carrying a burden equaling 125% of its own body weight. The average body weight of a full grown male is 100 pounds and a female is 85 pounds.</p><p>Each wing has a &ldquo;hand&rdquo; at its midpoint, consisting of three fingers and an opposable thumb. The fourth finger forms the rigid leading edge of the wing. In flight the hands cannot be used, but on the ground the aarakocra can use its hands almost as a human would. The aarakocra's body is protected by a thin bony plate on the chest, much like a solid rib cage. Talons on its legs can be used as claws and can be retracted to reveal a second set of hands, also with three fingers and an opposable thumb. Except for the chest plate, the entire skeleton is hollow and extremely fragile.</p><p>From a distance, the Athasian aarakocra resembles a huge <a href=\"/appendix/bird\">vulture</a>. Its black eyes, set in the front of the head, provide excellent vision over a long range. The plumage is generally black with a white collar for adult males and black or brown with a smaller white collar for females. Adolescents are a mixture of brown and black. The beak is large and covers most of the head. Plumage begins at the crown of the head and is darker near the head, except for the collar. Athasian aarakocra speak their own language and the languages of vultures and other large birds. Some speak the common tongue (5% to 10% chance depending on how deep in the wastelands a tribe lives).</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Combat:</b> Aarakocra can fight in the air or on the ground. They prefer aerial combat since their bones are too fragile to withstand a solid blow from a human-sized opponent. In combat against creatures on the ground, they prefer to fly over their victim and drop weighted nets. Some aarakocra use darts to harass ground-based opponents.</p><p>If their opponents can fly, the aarakocra generally forgo the use of the net, although large groups sometimes use nets on flying creatures. Normally, aarakocra attack flying creatures with long spears, diving from above and allowing the momentum to carry the spear through the target. Such an attack doubles the damage if the aarakocra have been able to dive at least 50 feet. Only the very largest aarakocra can carry more than one of these spears, they can attack with both at once with no penalty, causing double damage on each strike. All diving attacks are made at +4 and should be treated as a charge attack. All other penalties and restrictions of charge attacks apply.</p><p>The effect of the aarakocra's nets depends on if the opponent is flying at the time it becomes entangled. Creatures on the ground that are hit by a net are entangled and unable to participate in any combat until they make a successful Strength check to get free of the net. Flying creatures hit by a net can no longer fly and immediately begin falling. If they cannot escape the net or use some magical means to arrest the fall, normal falling damage applies.</p><p>Unless victims are entangled in nets, aarakocra are cautious in ground combat. If the aarakocra outnumber their opponents they advance in a straight line and thrust with their spears. If outnumbered, or the opponents are particularly tough, the aarakocra withdraw. Victims entangled in nets are killed or incapacitated for use as food or ransom.</p><p>Athasian aarakocra are mindful of their physical limitations as well as their comparatively low psionic abilities. They do not normally initiate psionic combat. At the first sign of psionic powers from any of their victims, however, all aarakocra that have some ability will use whatever attack and defense modes they can in an attempt to destroy the threat. Large groups of is or more aarakocra may initiate psionic combat if their leaders feel they can win quickly and avoid physical combat.</p><p>In desperation, an aarakocra can attempt to bite an opponent in combat. Because of the unwieldiness of its beak, the aarakocra has a THAC0 of 18 if attacking with this appendage. Further, the birdman causes only 1d2 points of damage with the beak.</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Habitat/Society:</b> Athasian aarakocra live in tribes with 6-20 (2d8+4) members, depending on the prestige of the leader. The largest tribe ever recorded had 50 members. The tribal hunting territory depends on the size of the tribe, usually about 500 square miles for a tribe of 10 members. There are no rigid boundaries between tribes and border disputes are not uncommon.</p><p>Alignments of tribe members are similar to the alignment of the leader. A tribe that has a leader who is neutral good may have neutral good, chaotic good, lawful good, and true neutral members. A predominantly evil tribe does not recognize boundaries with other tribes and treats other tribes as inferior beings to be eliminated.</p><p>Athasian aarakocra aren't happy in enclosed spaces, but they they take refuge in a cave or building if necessary.</p><p>Nonevil tribes live in rocky aeries in the highest peaks they can find. Evil tribes are normally nomadic and use an aerie made by another tribe if they need to remain in an area for a long time, even if they have to evict the tribe that made the nest.</p><p>Aarakocra aren't friendly toward intruders in their territory, especially caravans. They try to extract a toll from the caravan for passage through the desert. Good-aligned tribes allow unhindered passage of caravans that pay a tribute. If someone refuses to pay the tribute, the aarakocra try to capture scouts or outriders from the party and hold them until an even larger tribute is paid. The payment may be either livestock or shiny objects. Aarakocra are smart enough not to be taken in by glass baubles instead of gems, although they cannot tell the difference between the more common gems and the rare ones.</p><p>Evil tribes ask for tribute and often attack a caravan whether it pays or not. Aarakocra always demand shiny objects such as stones. These tribes find humans and demihumans to be quite tasty and prefer them to other food.</p><p>Good-aligned tribes of aarakocra sometimes return a lost traveler to the edge of the desert after first removing any valuables the traveler may be carrying. On very rare occasions a tribe might return a lost group of travelers to the more frequently traveled parts of the desert, again after first taking any valuables as payment.</p><p>The oldest male is the leader of the tribal hunting party and has 4+4 Hit Dice. The oldest female is in charge of the tribal aerie and has 3+3 HD. In tribes that have more than 15 members, the next oldest aarakocra serves as shaman and has 3+3 HD; the shaman completes the triumvirate necessary for proper worship and the summoning of elementals. (Interestingly, no magic-using aarakocra has ever been recorded.) Tribes without a shaman cannot summon <a href=\"/appendix/element1\">air elementals</a>, which is an important part of aarakocra culture.</p><p>The shaman is the leader of the daily sun worship. Aarakocra worship the sun because it provides them with the thermals they need to soar in search of food. The shaman also leads the mystic rituals used to summon an air elemental. Summoning an air elemental is usually done only in preparation for the tribe's most sacred ceremony, the hunt. Small tribes must band together for this ceremony to allow the triumvirate to be formed.</p><p>The ceremony to summon an air elemental must be conducted at dawn and requires the oldest male and female to emit a highpitched keening whistle. The shaman conducts an intricate dance around them, simultaneously chanting an ancient summoning mantra.</p><p>The hunt is the final part of the initiation of adolescent aarakocra to adulthood and often takes the tribe far from their normal teritory. The target is always a <a href=\"/appendix/drakalsi\">silt drake</a>. The hunt is the only time the females leave the relative safety of the nest. Even an evil tribe will not interfere with a tribe on a hunt. An air elemental is often summoned to help find the drake, but never takes part in the actual combat. Although the adult members of the tribe take part in the initial phases of the combat, it is the initiates who deliver the final, killing blows to me drake. Scars from the hunt are considered a mark of pride among all aarakocra.</p><p>The females spend about eight months of the year incubating their eggs. Athasian aarakocra mate for life and a pair normally produces as many as 10 offspring. A female lays one egg a year. Constant incubation is not required because of the high daytime temperatures, so the females can maintain the nest and keep the tribe's treasure in order.</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Ecology:</b> Athasian aarakocra are high on the food chain and have no natural enemies other than <a href=\"/appendix/drakatha\">drakes</a>. Unless evil, aarakocra leave their own territory only to hunt the silt drake and return as soon as possible when the hunt is over. (Evil aarakocra attack others, as noted above.) Aarakocra eggs and hatchlings are sought after by wealthy land owners who wish to use the creatures as scouts and sentries. An egg can bring as much as 10 cp in Tyr's marketplace. Tribes that have had eggs or hatchlings stolen have long memories and sometimes take revenge against the thief at a later date. Captive aarakocra join any tribe they come in contact with.</p><p>Athasian aarakocra have a natural life span of 21-30 years.</p>\n","images":["<img src=\"grf/ds.gif\" width=\"150\" height=\"75\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Dark Sun\" title=\"Dark Sun\" align=\"right\">","<img src=\"img/aarakath.gif\" alt=\"Aarakocra (Athas)\" title=\"Aarakocra (Athas)\" border=\"0\" width=\"300\" height=\"360\" style=\"text-align:right;\" align=\"right\">","<img src=\"grf/add2_01.gif\" width=\"200\" height=\"56\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Advanced Dungeons & Dragons 2nd Edition\">"],"setting":"Dark Sun","statblock":{"Aarakocra (Athas)":{"Activity Cycle":"Day","Alignment":"Any","Armor Class":"7","Climate/Terrain":"Deep desert","Damage/Attack":"1d3/1d3 or by weapon","Diet":"Carnivore","Frequency":"Rare","Hit Dice":"2+2","Intelligence":"Average (8-10)","Magic Resistance":"Nil","Morale":"Steady (11)","Movement":"6, Fl 36 (C)","No. Appearing":"1d10","No. of Attacks":"2","Organization":"Tribal","Size":"M (20'+ wingspan)","Special Attacks":"Nil","Special Defenses":"Nil","THAC0":"17","Treasure":"Varies","XP Value":"65"}},"title":"Aarakocra (Athas)"},"sources":["2433"],"statblock_names":[],"title":"Aarakocra (Athas)","prev_key":"zygraat","next_key":"aarakocr","monster_path":"/appendix/aarakath"}}},"pageContext":{"monster_key":"ghostone","monster_data":{"TSR":["Dragon162"],"fullBody":"  <table cellspacing=\"0\" cellpadding=\"0\"><tr><th>Climate/Terrain:</th>  <td>Any, often subterranean</td></tr><tr><th>Frequency:</th>        <td>Very rare</td></tr><tr><th>Organization:</th>     <td>None</td></tr><tr><th>Activity Cycle:</th>   <td>Shadow activated</td></tr><tr><th>Diet:</th>             <td>Living beings</td></tr><tr><th>Intelligence:</th>     <td>Average</td></tr><tr><th>Treasure:</th>         <td>50% E</td></tr><tr><th>Alignment:</th>        <td>(Any) evil</td></tr><tr><th>No. Appearing:</th>    <td>1</td></tr><tr><th>Armor Class:</th>      <td>3</td></tr><tr><th>Movement:</th>         <td>None</td></tr><tr><th>Hit Dice:</th>         <td>20 (stone only)</td></tr><tr><th>THAC0:</th>            <td>Not applicable</td></tr><tr><th>No. of Attacks:</th>   <td>1</td></tr><tr><th>Damage/Attack:</th>    <td>1-20</td></tr><tr><th>Special Attacks:</th>  <td>Blood drain</td></tr><tr><th>Special Defenses:</th> <td>None</td></tr><tr><th>Magic Resistance:</th> <td>See below</td></tr><tr><th>Size:</th>             <td>L (10' tall)</td></tr><tr><th>Morale:</th>           <td>Fearless</td></tr><tr><th>XP Value:</th>         <td>4,000</td></tr></table><p class=\"f\">Ghost-stones are just that: stones inhabited by <a href=\"/appendix/ghost\">ghosts</a>. A powerful, evil individual may choose to send his malicious spirit into a specially prepared stone upon his death. The person prefers an undead existence to risking the punishments of the netherworld. The ghost-stone is often placed so that it guards the treasure the evil person hoarded in life; the treasure may actually be concealed within the stone itself</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Combat:</b> If the shadow of a character falls upon a ghost-stone, that person is trapped. The individual can still fight and cast spells, but is unable to move more than 10' away from the stone. The ghoststone uses the shadowy connection to drain the victim's blood, doing 1-20 hp damage per round automatically.</p><p>There are two ways to destroy a ghoststone. If the stone holding the evil ghost is completely hacked apart, the spirit is forced to depart and undertake its long delayed journey to the netherworld. An <i>exorcism</i> spell has the same effect.</p><p>The ghost in the stone can be pacified if its name is known. A simple command of: \"[Ghost's true name] be still, and at peace\" calms the angry spirit even if its treasure is taken. In a campaign, the DM has the option of revealing the ghost's name to the PCs, perhaps making the answer a puzzle or riddle.</p><p>Since ghost-stones look like any other stones, they normally attack with surprise. The first indication of trouble is when a character's shadow gets automatically trapped. If the characters have some reason to be suspicious of that particular stone, the DM should allow a saving throw vs. wands to the PC.</p><p>Any character who strikes the ghoststone physically, without first choosing an attack angle that guarantees that his shadow will not fall upon the stone, could end up trapped also. Each person in addition to the first gains a saving throw vs. wands to avoid entrapment. Only one person at a time will be drained of blood, however. Other trapped individuals are simply unable to move away. If the ghoststone survives attacks against it, it eventually drains all of its victims of blood.</p><p>A cleric has the same chance to turn away the spirit in a ghost-stone as he has to turn a ghost. If turning is successful, the ghost-stone releases all victims currently being held. It will not attack unless it is itself attacked, or if a character tries to steal the treasure the ghost-stone is guarding.</p><p>(Note that the \"Habitat/Society\" category is meaningless for the ghost-stone.)</p><p></p><p class=\"f\">In many cultures, a person's shadow is linked to that person with strong magical bonds. In <i>The Golden Bough</i>, a classic collection of folklore written in 1922, Sir James Frazer discussed shadows on pages 220-222. He wrote that \"the savage regards his shadow as his soul, or at least a vital part of himself. As such it can become a source of danger to him.\" If a primitive man's shadow was trampled, struck, or stabbed, he felt the injury as if it were done to himself; if the shadow was pulled away from him entirely, the man believed he would die. Magicians on the island of Wetar, said Frazer, could make a man ill by stabbing his shadow.</p><p>In the Banks Islands in the Canadian Arctic are remarkably long stones called \"eating ghosts.\" because dangerous ghosts were believed to live in them. If a man's shadow touched one of these stones, the ghost drew his soul out so that the man died. Such stones were therefore set in houses to guard them. A messenger sent to a house by an absent owner had to call out the name of the sender to keep the watchful ghost from attacking.</p><p>When the lid was about to be placed on the coffin at a funeral in China, the bystanders stepped back or even moved to another room, to avoid endangering their health by allowing their shadows to be enclosed in the coffin. When the coffin was about to be lowered into the grave, bystanders stepped away so their shadows did not fall into the pit. Grave-diggers and coffin-bearers avoided these dangers by tying strips of cloth tightly around their waists to keep their shadows attached.</p><p>Animals, too, were believed to be harmed or to bring harm by means of their shadows. A snail from the hills of Malaya was believed to suck the blood of cattle through their shadows; the cattle grew lean and sometimes died from blood loss. It was once believed in Arabia that if a hyena trod on a man's shadow, it deprived him of both speech and movement.</p><p>If a shadow is seen as so closely tied to the life of a man that its loss means injury or death, the shrinking of the shadow is logically regarded with fear. In Amboyna and Uliase, two islands pear the equator (where little or no shadow is cast at noon), local people did not to go out of their houses at midday to avoid risking the loss of their souls' shadows.</p><p>The Mangaians told of a mighty warrior whose strength waxed and waned with the length of his shadow. In the morning, when his shadow was longest, his strength was greatest; as his shadow shortened toward noon, his strength ebbed, till it reached its lowest point at noon. As his shadow lengthened in the afternoon, his strength came back. An enemy discovered the secret of this man's strength and killed him at noon.</p><p>Sir James Frazer also discussed customs practiced in his day (1922) in southeastern Europe. When the foundation of a new building was being laid in Greece, a cock, ram, or lamb was slain; its blood flowed on the foundation stone, under which the animal was then buried. The sacrifice was thought to give strength and stability to the building. Sometimes, instead of killing an animal, the builder led a man to the foundation stone, secretly measured his shadow, and buried the measure under the stone. The builder sometimes laid the foundation stone upon the man's shadow instead, which it was thought would cause the man to die within a year. Romanians in Transylvania thought that a man whose shadow was so entombed would die within 40 days; persons passing by a building under construction often hear a warning cry: \"Beware lest they take thy shadow!\"\\ There were even shadow traders whose business was to give architects the shadows necessary for securing walls. The measure of a shadow was seen as equivalent to the shadow itself; to bury a shadow's measure was to bury the soul of the man whose shadow was measured (thus dooming him). The custom was a substitute for an older practice of sealing a living person in the walls, or crushing him under the foundation stone of a new building; this caused his ghost to haunt the place and guard it against enemies.</p>\n","images":["<img src=\"grf/dr.gif\" width=\"150\" height=\"75\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Dragon Magazine\" title=\"Dragon Magazine\" align=\"right\">","<img src=\"grf/tsr_sm.png\" width=\"56\" height=\"59\" border=\"0\" alt=\"TSR\">"],"setting":"Dragon Magazine","statblock":{"Ghost-Stone":{"Activity Cycle":"Shadow activated","Alignment":"(Any) evil","Armor Class":"3","Climate/Terrain":"Any, often subterranean","Damage/Attack":"1-20","Diet":"Living beings","Frequency":"Very rare","Hit Dice":"20 (stone only)","Intelligence":"Average","Magic Resistance":"See below","Morale":"Fearless","Movement":"None","No. Appearing":"1","No. of Attacks":"1","Organization":"None","Size":"L (10' tall)","Special Attacks":"Blood drain","Special Defenses":"None","THAC0":"Not applicable","Treasure":"50% E","XP Value":"4,000"}},"title":"Ghost-Stone"},"sources":["Dragon162"],"statblock_names":[],"title":"Ghost-Stone","prev_key":"ghost","next_key":"ghoughjh","monster_path":"/appendix/ghostone"}},"staticQueryHashes":[],"slicesMap":{}}
