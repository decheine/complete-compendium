Once per day, the cunnequine can affect one creature as if he had donned a <i>helm of opposite alignment</i>. The victim must be touched by the cunnequine's horn without damage, and it is allowed a saving throw vs. spells at +2 to avoid this effect.</p><p>A cunnequine can also affect undead and conjured creatures as if it were a priest of 11th level turning undead. A turn effect causes conjured creatures to be dismissed to their home plane.</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Habitat/Society:</b> Cunnequines are identical in habitat and society to sylvan unicorns, except that they are more lawful in nature. Cunnequines are thus more likely to attack hunters and predators who harm living things native to the cunnequine's territory.</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Ecology:</b> Cunnequines are identical in ecology to sylvan unicorns.</p><br clear=\"all\" style=\"clear:both; height:0;\">\r\n","images":["<img src=\"grf/dr.gif\" width=\"150\" height=\"75\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Dragon Magazine\" title=\"Dragon Magazine\" align=\"right\">","<img src=\"grf/add2_01.gif\" width=\"200\" height=\"56\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Advanced Dungeons & Dragons 2nd Edition\">"],"setting":"Dragon Magazine","statblock":{"Unicorn, Cunnequine":{"Activity Cycle":"Day","Alignment":"Lawful good","Armor Class":"2","Climate/Terrain":"Temperate Woodlands","Damage/Attack":"1-6/1-6/1-12","Diet":"Herbivore","Frequency":"Rare","Hit Dice":"4+4","Intelligence":"Average (8-10)","Magic Resistance":"20%","Morale":"Elite (13-14)","Movement":"24","No. Appearing":"1-6","No. of Attacks":"3","Organization":"Family","Size":"L","Special Attacks":"See below","Special Defenses":"See below","THAC0":"17","Treasure":"X","XP Value":"1,400"}},"title":"Unicorn, Cunnequine"},"sources":["Dragon#190"],"statblock_names":[],"title":"Unicorn, Cunnequine","prev_key":"unicbrow","next_key":"unicfaer"}},"staticQueryHashes":[],"slicesMap":{}}
