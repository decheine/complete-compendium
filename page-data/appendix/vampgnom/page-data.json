While the powers listed above are the most common, some aarakocra have different or additional powers.</p><p class=\"f\">A race of intelligent, birdlike creatures living in the deepest deserts of Athas, the rare Athasian <a href=\"/appendix/aarakocr\">aarakocra</a> spends its time soaring on thermals in search of food.</p><p>The aarakocra is 7 to 8 feet tall with a wingspan of 20 feet or more. Because of its large wingspan, an aarakocra can carry as much as 75% of its own body weight and still fly easily. An aarakocra can fly a short distance carrying a burden equaling 125% of its own body weight. The average body weight of a full grown male is 100 pounds and a female is 85 pounds.</p><p>Each wing has a &ldquo;hand&rdquo; at its midpoint, consisting of three fingers and an opposable thumb. The fourth finger forms the rigid leading edge of the wing. In flight the hands cannot be used, but on the ground the aarakocra can use its hands almost as a human would. The aarakocra's body is protected by a thin bony plate on the chest, much like a solid rib cage. Talons on its legs can be used as claws and can be retracted to reveal a second set of hands, also with three fingers and an opposable thumb. Except for the chest plate, the entire skeleton is hollow and extremely fragile.</p><p>From a distance, the Athasian aarakocra resembles a huge <a href=\"/appendix/bird\">vulture</a>. Its black eyes, set in the front of the head, provide excellent vision over a long range. The plumage is generally black with a white collar for adult males and black or brown with a smaller white collar for females. Adolescents are a mixture of brown and black. The beak is large and covers most of the head. Plumage begins at the crown of the head and is darker near the head, except for the collar. Athasian aarakocra speak their own language and the languages of vultures and other large birds. Some speak the common tongue (5% to 10% chance depending on how deep in the wastelands a tribe lives).</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Combat:</b> Aarakocra can fight in the air or on the ground. They prefer aerial combat since their bones are too fragile to withstand a solid blow from a human-sized opponent. In combat against creatures on the ground, they prefer to fly over their victim and drop weighted nets. Some aarakocra use darts to harass ground-based opponents.</p><p>If their opponents can fly, the aarakocra generally forgo the use of the net, although large groups sometimes use nets on flying creatures. Normally, aarakocra attack flying creatures with long spears, diving from above and allowing the momentum to carry the spear through the target. Such an attack doubles the damage if the aarakocra have been able to dive at least 50 feet. Only the very largest aarakocra can carry more than one of these spears, they can attack with both at once with no penalty, causing double damage on each strike. All diving attacks are made at +4 and should be treated as a charge attack. All other penalties and restrictions of charge attacks apply.</p><p>The effect of the aarakocra's nets depends on if the opponent is flying at the time it becomes entangled. Creatures on the ground that are hit by a net are entangled and unable to participate in any combat until they make a successful Strength check to get free of the net. Flying creatures hit by a net can no longer fly and immediately begin falling. If they cannot escape the net or use some magical means to arrest the fall, normal falling damage applies.</p><p>Unless victims are entangled in nets, aarakocra are cautious in ground combat. If the aarakocra outnumber their opponents they advance in a straight line and thrust with their spears. If outnumbered, or the opponents are particularly tough, the aarakocra withdraw. Victims entangled in nets are killed or incapacitated for use as food or ransom.</p><p>Athasian aarakocra are mindful of their physical limitations as well as their comparatively low psionic abilities. They do not normally initiate psionic combat. At the first sign of psionic powers from any of their victims, however, all aarakocra that have some ability will use whatever attack and defense modes they can in an attempt to destroy the threat. Large groups of is or more aarakocra may initiate psionic combat if their leaders feel they can win quickly and avoid physical combat.</p><p>In desperation, an aarakocra can attempt to bite an opponent in combat. Because of the unwieldiness of its beak, the aarakocra has a THAC0 of 18 if attacking with this appendage. Further, the birdman causes only 1d2 points of damage with the beak.</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Habitat/Society:</b> Athasian aarakocra live in tribes with 6-20 (2d8+4) members, depending on the prestige of the leader. The largest tribe ever recorded had 50 members. The tribal hunting territory depends on the size of the tribe, usually about 500 square miles for a tribe of 10 members. There are no rigid boundaries between tribes and border disputes are not uncommon.</p><p>Alignments of tribe members are similar to the alignment of the leader. A tribe that has a leader who is neutral good may have neutral good, chaotic good, lawful good, and true neutral members. A predominantly evil tribe does not recognize boundaries with other tribes and treats other tribes as inferior beings to be eliminated.</p><p>Athasian aarakocra aren't happy in enclosed spaces, but they they take refuge in a cave or building if necessary.</p><p>Nonevil tribes live in rocky aeries in the highest peaks they can find. Evil tribes are normally nomadic and use an aerie made by another tribe if they need to remain in an area for a long time, even if they have to evict the tribe that made the nest.</p><p>Aarakocra aren't friendly toward intruders in their territory, especially caravans. They try to extract a toll from the caravan for passage through the desert. Good-aligned tribes allow unhindered passage of caravans that pay a tribute. If someone refuses to pay the tribute, the aarakocra try to capture scouts or outriders from the party and hold them until an even larger tribute is paid. The payment may be either livestock or shiny objects. Aarakocra are smart enough not to be taken in by glass baubles instead of gems, although they cannot tell the difference between the more common gems and the rare ones.</p><p>Evil tribes ask for tribute and often attack a caravan whether it pays or not. Aarakocra always demand shiny objects such as stones. These tribes find humans and demihumans to be quite tasty and prefer them to other food.</p><p>Good-aligned tribes of aarakocra sometimes return a lost traveler to the edge of the desert after first removing any valuables the traveler may be carrying. On very rare occasions a tribe might return a lost group of travelers to the more frequently traveled parts of the desert, again after first taking any valuables as payment.</p><p>The oldest male is the leader of the tribal hunting party and has 4+4 Hit Dice. The oldest female is in charge of the tribal aerie and has 3+3 HD. In tribes that have more than 15 members, the next oldest aarakocra serves as shaman and has 3+3 HD; the shaman completes the triumvirate necessary for proper worship and the summoning of elementals. (Interestingly, no magic-using aarakocra has ever been recorded.) Tribes without a shaman cannot summon <a href=\"/appendix/element1\">air elementals</a>, which is an important part of aarakocra culture.</p><p>The shaman is the leader of the daily sun worship. Aarakocra worship the sun because it provides them with the thermals they need to soar in search of food. The shaman also leads the mystic rituals used to summon an air elemental. Summoning an air elemental is usually done only in preparation for the tribe's most sacred ceremony, the hunt. Small tribes must band together for this ceremony to allow the triumvirate to be formed.</p><p>The ceremony to summon an air elemental must be conducted at dawn and requires the oldest male and female to emit a highpitched keening whistle. The shaman conducts an intricate dance around them, simultaneously chanting an ancient summoning mantra.</p><p>The hunt is the final part of the initiation of adolescent aarakocra to adulthood and often takes the tribe far from their normal teritory. The target is always a <a href=\"/appendix/drakalsi\">silt drake</a>. The hunt is the only time the females leave the relative safety of the nest. Even an evil tribe will not interfere with a tribe on a hunt. An air elemental is often summoned to help find the drake, but never takes part in the actual combat. Although the adult members of the tribe take part in the initial phases of the combat, it is the initiates who deliver the final, killing blows to me drake. Scars from the hunt are considered a mark of pride among all aarakocra.</p><p>The females spend about eight months of the year incubating their eggs. Athasian aarakocra mate for life and a pair normally produces as many as 10 offspring. A female lays one egg a year. Constant incubation is not required because of the high daytime temperatures, so the females can maintain the nest and keep the tribe's treasure in order.</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Ecology:</b> Athasian aarakocra are high on the food chain and have no natural enemies other than <a href=\"/appendix/drakatha\">drakes</a>. Unless evil, aarakocra leave their own territory only to hunt the silt drake and return as soon as possible when the hunt is over. (Evil aarakocra attack others, as noted above.) Aarakocra eggs and hatchlings are sought after by wealthy land owners who wish to use the creatures as scouts and sentries. An egg can bring as much as 10 cp in Tyr's marketplace. Tribes that have had eggs or hatchlings stolen have long memories and sometimes take revenge against the thief at a later date. Captive aarakocra join any tribe they come in contact with.</p><p>Athasian aarakocra have a natural life span of 21-30 years.</p><p></p><br clear=\"all\" style=\"clear:both; height:0;\">\r\n","images":["<img src=\"grf/ds.gif\" width=\"150\" height=\"75\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Dark Sun\" title=\"Dark Sun\" align=\"right\">","<img src=\"img/aarakath.gif\" alt=\"Aarakocra (Athas)\" title=\"Aarakocra (Athas)\" border=\"0\" width=\"300\" height=\"360\" style=\"text-align:right;\" align=\"right\">","<img src=\"grf/add2_01.gif\" width=\"200\" height=\"56\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Advanced Dungeons & Dragons 2nd Edition\">"],"setting":"Dark Sun","statblock":{"Aarakocra (Athas)":{"Activity Cycle":"Day","Alignment":"Any","Armor Class":"7","Climate/Terrain":"Deep desert","Damage/Attack":"1d3/1d3 or by weapon","Diet":"Carnivore","Frequency":"Rare","Hit Dice":"2+2","Intelligence":"Average (8-10)","Magic Resistance":"Nil","Morale":"Steady (11)","Movement":"6, Fl 36 (C)","No. Appearing":"1d10","No. of Attacks":"2","Organization":"Tribal","Size":"M (20'+ wingspan)","Special Attacks":"Nil","Special Defenses":"Nil","THAC0":"17","Treasure":"Varies","XP Value":"65"}},"title":"Aarakocra (Athas)"},"sources":["2433"],"statblock_names":[],"title":"Aarakocra (Athas)","prev_key":"zygraat","next_key":"aarakocr","monster_path":"/appendix/aarakath"}}},"pageContext":{"monster_key":"vampgnom","monster_data":{"TSR":["2122"],"fullBody":"  <table cellspacing=\"0\" cellpadding=\"0\"><tr><th>Climate/Terrain:</th><td>Any subterranean</td></tr><tr><th>Frequency:</th><td>Very rare</td></tr><tr><th>Organization:</th><td>Solitary</td></tr><tr><th>Activity Cycle:</th><td>Any</td></tr><tr><th>Diet:</th><td>Special</td></tr><tr><th>Intelligence:</th><td>Genius (17-18)</td></tr><tr><th>Treasure:</th><td>F</td></tr><tr><th>Alignment:</th><td>Chaotic evil</td></tr><tr><th>No. Appearing:</th><td>1</td></tr><tr><th>Armor Class:</th><td>0</td></tr><tr><th>Movement:</th><td>9</td></tr><tr><th>Hit Dice:</th><td>6+3</td></tr><tr><th>THAC0:</th><td>13</td></tr><tr><th>No. of Attacks:</th><td>1</td></tr><tr><th>Damage/Attack:</th><td>1d4</td></tr><tr><th>Special Attacks:</th><td>See below</td></tr><tr><th>Special Defenses:</th><td>See below</td></tr><tr><th>Magic Resistance:</th><td>Nil</td></tr><tr><th>Size:</th><td>S (3-4' tall)</td></tr><tr><th>Morale:</th><td>Elite (13-14)</td></tr><tr><th>XP Value:</th><td>3,000 (+1,000 per 100 years of age)</td></tr></table><p class=\"f\">While the race of <a href=\"/appendix/gnome\">gnomes</a> is little understood by many surface dwellers, the deadly breed of <a href=\"/appendix/vampire\">vampire</a> tat these creatures spawn are even more alien. Moving about far beneath the world's surface, they are seldom encountered by humans or other demi-humans. When they are found, however, they are terrible foes indeed.</p><p>Gnomish vampires are shorter and slighter of build than <a href=\"/appendix/vampdwar\">dwarvish vampires</a>. Unlike other undead, however, the passage of time is visible in the features of a gnomish vampire. Thus, their features are grooved and worn, showing the full burden of the years that have passed them by.</p><p>Gnomish vampires are still able to understand the languages they spoke in life, but are unable to speak themselves. There is no known reason for this curse of silence, save that it robs them of the ability to joke and sing that they so loved in life. Because of this, most communications with gnomish vampires require written messages.</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Combat:</b> Physical combat with any form of vampire is dangerous indeed. When the opponent is a gnomish vampire, however, the penalty for defeat may be a horrible life as a helpless cripple.</p><p>The gnomish vampire gains no bonus for strength in combat, for its ties to the negative material plane have not infused it with great physical power. Thus, an unarmed blow from the creature will inflict but 1d4 points of damage. Because their hand-to-hand attack is so ineffective, they will often employ flails or other weapons in combat.</p><p>While the hand-to-hand blows of gnomish vampires are weak, however, they are not without a powerful debilitating affect. Those struck by such attacks will begin to feel the painful arthritic attack of the creature instantly, for each successful attack drains 2 points of Dexterity from the victim. The result is a painful stiffness in the joints and muscles that can, if the victim suffers several attacks, be crippling or even fatal. Those reduced to a Dexterity score of 0 will be slain as the creeping paralysis spreads through their lungs and heart, making it impossible for them to survive. Gnomes who die in this fashion may themselves become undead (see &ldquo;Ecology&rdquo;) if steps are not taken to prevent this foul transformation.</p><p>The gnomish vampire is able to add a +1 bonus to its attack rolls against creatures such as <a href=\"/appendix/kobold\">kobolds</a> or <a href=\"/appendix/goblin\">goblins</a>. Similarly, creatures like <a href=\"/appendix/ogre\">ogres</a>, <a href=\"/appendix/troll\">trolls</a>, and <a href=\"/appendix/bugbear\">bugbears</a> are unable to effectively battle such an agile creature, suffering a -4 on their attack rolls.</p><p>The natural 60' infravision of living gnomes still exists in their vampiric form, but is augmented by their dark nature, Like dwarven vampires, they are able to see in even the dimmest of lighting as if it were full daylight.</p><p>Once per turn, the gnomish vampire may twist its features into a horrible smile. Those who look upon the gnome at this time must save versus spells or begin to laugh. The effects of this grin are the same as those of a <i>Tasha's incontrollable hideous laughter</i> spell, save that the duration is doubled and the character suffers 1d4 points of damage per round that they are laughing. As the vampire ages, this power becomes even more horrible, inflicting greater damage and becoming harder to save against.</p><p>Gnomish vampires can be hit only by metal weapons, and then only by those that are magical and have a +1 or better enchantment. Non-metal magical weapons are utterly useless against the creature. Gnomes also have the traditional vampiric immunity to such spells as <i>charm</i>, <i>sleep</i>, or <i>hold</i>, and cannot be harmed by poisons or disease. They are immune to the effects of all spells from the illusion/phantasm school and take only half damage from magical attacks that depend on lightning, cold, or fire.</p><p>Gnomish vampires that are driven to zero hit points by spells or weapons are not destroyed. Rather, they are driven into their <i>spectral form</i> (see below) and forced to flee from combat. While in this form they must fly as quickly as possible to the cavern that holds their sarcophagus. If they are unable to reach their final resting place within 12 rounds, they will break up and be utterly destroyed.</p><p>Gnomish vampires have the ability to assume a <i>spectral form</i>. In this guise, they appear to be nothing more than sphere of light - much like a <a href=\"/appendix/willowis\">will o'wisp</a>. While in this glowing shape, the creature can pass through solid stone wails or similar barricades. They cannot, however, pass through any living or once living material in this shape, so a wooden wall is impassable to them.</p><p>Gnomish vampires are unable to change their shapes as some other undead creatures can. Still, they are not unable to disguise themselves when the need arises, for they can cast a <i>change self</i> spell at will and may maintain the deception provided by this spell for an unlimited period of time.</p><p>When they wish to, gnomish vampires are able to command any animal they encounter. They cannot, however, summon such creatures to them and must rely on those that chance brings to them. Once they have commanded a specific creature to do their bidding, it will remain with them for 2d4 days before moving on.</p><p>Gnomish vampires can employ an ability similar to that of the <i>spider climb</i> spell. This power, however, only permits them to scale surfaces built of stone or earth and they are unable to cling to those surfaces made of wood or other substances. This power can be invoked at will.</p><p>The creature retains the special abilities that it had in life, just as all other types of vampires do. Thus, they are able to employ all of their class and magical abilities long after they have become undead.</p><p>Like dwarven vampires, these creatures are unusually resistant to magic. Any saving throw they are required to make versus spells, rods, wands, or staves is made at a +5 bonus. As the creature ages, it will become even more resistant to magic as described in &ldquo;Habitat/Society&rdquo; below. Because of this, gnomish vampires are greatly hindered when they attempt to employ magical devices. Whenever they seek to use such items, there is a 35% chance that the device will malfunction. This does not apply to weapons, armors, shields, or those items that duplicate the effects of illusionist spells. If the creature was a thief in life, it can also employ those devices used by such characters without penalty.</p><p>The natural familiarity of these creatures with the underground environment gives them many special abilities in life, and all of these are manifested in the creature after death. Thus, the gnome can determine approximate directions when underground 3 times in 6, and their approximate depth underground 4 times in 6, detect slopes or grades 5 times in 6, and detect unsafe walls or floors 7 times in 10.</p><p>Gnomish vampires can be held at bay in several ways. They cannot turn away from any <i>jewel</i> (see <i>Gems</i> in the <i>Dungeon Master's Guide</i>) that is presented to them for 2d4 rounds. If they are attacked during that time, they are freed of this enchantment and can act normally. Similarly, they can be turned aside by priests or paladins who present a holy symbol strongly to them. As they grow older, though, it becomes harder and harder to turn them in this fashion.</p><p>Gnomish vampires can be burned by holy water splashed upon them or contact with holy symbols, but suffer only 1d4 points of damage per vial or successful attack roll. They cannot approach someone who displays a holy symbol and has strong convictions about the validity of their beliefs, but neither are they driven away from such persons.</p><p>The surest way to destroy a gnomish vampire is to impale it on a spike made of purest silver and enchanted with a <i>bless</i> spell. As soon as the spike is driven into the body of the creature, its material form is destroyed and it will collapse dead. While the creature is truly lifeless at this point, it can be revived simply by removing the spike. In order to assure that they creature remains dead a number of things must be done. First, the hands must be cut from the corpse and boiled in a natural volcanic hot spring for 24 hours. Second, the body must be placed in a wooden casket that will be sealed at the end of the destruction process. Lastly, when the body lies in the coffin, its eyes must be removed and replaced with precious gems. Stones of higher quality may be used, but those of lesser value will allow the creature to be revived. Finally, the lid of the casket is hammered into place and the nightmare is ended.</p><p>Daylight is devastating to these creatures, destroying them utterly and instantly when it falls upon them. Magical spells that duplicate sunlight, even those that normally harm undead, do not affect these creatures however, for their natural magical resistance protects them from such things.</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Habitat/Society:</b> The gnomish vampire lives in the deepest of caverns, hiding like a hermit from all surface dwellers. Where they were charismatic and mischievous in life, now they are dour and reclusive. They only seek out others when they need to feed and will gladly prey on the energies of any human, demihuman, or humanoid they encounter.</p><p>As gnomish vampires age, they become more dangerous and more powerful. Very old vampires are, of course, among the most deadly beings found in Ravenloft or any other realm.</p><table class=\"ip\"><tr class=\"bk\"><th>Age</th><th>HD</th><th>Laughter</th><th>To Hit</th><th>Saves</th><th>Turn</th></tr><tr><td>0-99</td><td>6+3</td><td>0/1d4</td><td>+1</td><td>+5</td><td>Vampire</td></tr><tr><td>100-199</td><td>7+3</td><td>-1/1d6</td><td>+1</td><td>+5</td><td>Vampire</td></tr><tr><td>200-299</td><td>8+3</td><td>-2/1d8</td><td>+1</td><td>+6</td><td>Ghost</td></tr><tr><td>300-399</td><td>9+3</td><td>-3/1d8</td><td>+2</td><td>+6</td><td>Ghost</td></tr><tr><td>400-499</td><td>10+2</td><td>-4/1d10</td><td>+2</td><td>+7</td><td>Lich</td></tr><tr><td>500+</td><td>11+2</td><td>-5/1d10</td><td>+3</td><td>+8</td><td>Special</td></tr></table><p class=\"ni\"><i>HD</i> indicates the number of Hit Dice that the creature has at any given age.<br><i>Laughter</i> lists the saving throw modifiers and the damage inflicted by its deadly grin.<br><i>To Hit</i> is the minimum magical plus that must be associated with a metal weapon.

While this resembles the aging attack of a <a href=\"/appendix/ghost\">ghost</a>, it is not truly the same, for the person is not actually aged, their body is just robbed of its youthful vitality. While the difference is fine, it is important; many believe that the vampire's attack is far worse than that of the ghost.</p><p>Gnomish vampires seldom create others of their kind. When they opt to do so, however, the process is not without risk. The vampire must first slay a victim with its debilitating touch and then move the body to the sarcophagus in which the vampire itself sleeps. For the next three days, the body must lie in the coffin while the vampire rests atop it, allowing its essences to seep slowly into the evolving vampire. At the end of this time, the slain gnome rises as a fully functioning vampire, completely under the control of its creator. While the gnome vampire rests atop its coffin, it is unable to regenerate any lost hit points or employ any of its spell-like abilities. Thus, the creature is far more vulnerable to attack at this time than it normally might be. In addition, it cannot interrupt the creation process once it has begun or both the would-be vampire and its creator will die.</p><p></p><br clear=\"all\" style=\"clear:both; height:0;\">\r\n","images":["<img src=\"grf/rv.gif\" width=\"150\" height=\"75\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Ravenloft\" title=\"Ravenloft\" align=\"right\">","<img src=\"img/vampgnom.gif\" alt=\"Vampire, Gnome\" title=\"Vampire, Gnome\" border=\"0\" width=\"300\" height=\"360\" style=\"text-align:right;\" align=\"right\">","<img src=\"grf/add2_01.gif\" width=\"200\" height=\"56\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Advanced Dungeons & Dragons 2nd Edition\">"],"setting":"Ravenloft","statblock":{"Vampire, Gnome":{"Activity Cycle":"Any","Alignment":"Chaotic evil","Armor Class":"0","Climate/Terrain":"Any subterranean","Damage/Attack":"1d4","Diet":"Special","Frequency":"Very rare","Hit Dice":"6+3","Intelligence":"Genius (17-18)","Magic Resistance":"Nil","Morale":"Elite (13-14)","Movement":"9","No. Appearing":"1","No. of Attacks":"1","Organization":"Solitary","Size":"S (3-4' tall)","Special Attacks":"See below","Special Defenses":"See below","THAC0":"13","Treasure":"F","XP Value":"3,000 (+1,000 per 100 years of age)"}},"title":"Vampire, Gnome"},"sources":["2122"],"statblock_names":[],"title":"Vampire, Gnome","prev_key":"vampelf","next_key":"vampgobl","monster_path":"/appendix/vampgnom"}},"staticQueryHashes":[],"slicesMap":{}}
