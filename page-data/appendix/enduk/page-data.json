While the powers listed above are the most common, some aarakocra have different or additional powers.</p><p class=\"f\">A race of intelligent, birdlike creatures living in the deepest deserts of Athas, the rare Athasian <a href=\"/appendix/aarakocr\">aarakocra</a> spends its time soaring on thermals in search of food.</p><p>The aarakocra is 7 to 8 feet tall with a wingspan of 20 feet or more. Because of its large wingspan, an aarakocra can carry as much as 75% of its own body weight and still fly easily. An aarakocra can fly a short distance carrying a burden equaling 125% of its own body weight. The average body weight of a full grown male is 100 pounds and a female is 85 pounds.</p><p>Each wing has a &ldquo;hand&rdquo; at its midpoint, consisting of three fingers and an opposable thumb. The fourth finger forms the rigid leading edge of the wing. In flight the hands cannot be used, but on the ground the aarakocra can use its hands almost as a human would. The aarakocra's body is protected by a thin bony plate on the chest, much like a solid rib cage. Talons on its legs can be used as claws and can be retracted to reveal a second set of hands, also with three fingers and an opposable thumb. Except for the chest plate, the entire skeleton is hollow and extremely fragile.</p><p>From a distance, the Athasian aarakocra resembles a huge <a href=\"/appendix/bird\">vulture</a>. Its black eyes, set in the front of the head, provide excellent vision over a long range. The plumage is generally black with a white collar for adult males and black or brown with a smaller white collar for females. Adolescents are a mixture of brown and black. The beak is large and covers most of the head. Plumage begins at the crown of the head and is darker near the head, except for the collar. Athasian aarakocra speak their own language and the languages of vultures and other large birds. Some speak the common tongue (5% to 10% chance depending on how deep in the wastelands a tribe lives).</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Combat:</b> Aarakocra can fight in the air or on the ground. They prefer aerial combat since their bones are too fragile to withstand a solid blow from a human-sized opponent. In combat against creatures on the ground, they prefer to fly over their victim and drop weighted nets. Some aarakocra use darts to harass ground-based opponents.</p><p>If their opponents can fly, the aarakocra generally forgo the use of the net, although large groups sometimes use nets on flying creatures. Normally, aarakocra attack flying creatures with long spears, diving from above and allowing the momentum to carry the spear through the target. Such an attack doubles the damage if the aarakocra have been able to dive at least 50 feet. Only the very largest aarakocra can carry more than one of these spears, they can attack with both at once with no penalty, causing double damage on each strike. All diving attacks are made at +4 and should be treated as a charge attack. All other penalties and restrictions of charge attacks apply.</p><p>The effect of the aarakocra's nets depends on if the opponent is flying at the time it becomes entangled. Creatures on the ground that are hit by a net are entangled and unable to participate in any combat until they make a successful Strength check to get free of the net. Flying creatures hit by a net can no longer fly and immediately begin falling. If they cannot escape the net or use some magical means to arrest the fall, normal falling damage applies.</p><p>Unless victims are entangled in nets, aarakocra are cautious in ground combat. If the aarakocra outnumber their opponents they advance in a straight line and thrust with their spears. If outnumbered, or the opponents are particularly tough, the aarakocra withdraw. Victims entangled in nets are killed or incapacitated for use as food or ransom.</p><p>Athasian aarakocra are mindful of their physical limitations as well as their comparatively low psionic abilities. They do not normally initiate psionic combat. At the first sign of psionic powers from any of their victims, however, all aarakocra that have some ability will use whatever attack and defense modes they can in an attempt to destroy the threat. Large groups of is or more aarakocra may initiate psionic combat if their leaders feel they can win quickly and avoid physical combat.</p><p>In desperation, an aarakocra can attempt to bite an opponent in combat. Because of the unwieldiness of its beak, the aarakocra has a THAC0 of 18 if attacking with this appendage. Further, the birdman causes only 1d2 points of damage with the beak.</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Habitat/Society:</b> Athasian aarakocra live in tribes with 6-20 (2d8+4) members, depending on the prestige of the leader. The largest tribe ever recorded had 50 members. The tribal hunting territory depends on the size of the tribe, usually about 500 square miles for a tribe of 10 members. There are no rigid boundaries between tribes and border disputes are not uncommon.</p><p>Alignments of tribe members are similar to the alignment of the leader. A tribe that has a leader who is neutral good may have neutral good, chaotic good, lawful good, and true neutral members. A predominantly evil tribe does not recognize boundaries with other tribes and treats other tribes as inferior beings to be eliminated.</p><p>Athasian aarakocra aren't happy in enclosed spaces, but they they take refuge in a cave or building if necessary.</p><p>Nonevil tribes live in rocky aeries in the highest peaks they can find. Evil tribes are normally nomadic and use an aerie made by another tribe if they need to remain in an area for a long time, even if they have to evict the tribe that made the nest.</p><p>Aarakocra aren't friendly toward intruders in their territory, especially caravans. They try to extract a toll from the caravan for passage through the desert. Good-aligned tribes allow unhindered passage of caravans that pay a tribute. If someone refuses to pay the tribute, the aarakocra try to capture scouts or outriders from the party and hold them until an even larger tribute is paid. The payment may be either livestock or shiny objects. Aarakocra are smart enough not to be taken in by glass baubles instead of gems, although they cannot tell the difference between the more common gems and the rare ones.</p><p>Evil tribes ask for tribute and often attack a caravan whether it pays or not. Aarakocra always demand shiny objects such as stones. These tribes find humans and demihumans to be quite tasty and prefer them to other food.</p><p>Good-aligned tribes of aarakocra sometimes return a lost traveler to the edge of the desert after first removing any valuables the traveler may be carrying. On very rare occasions a tribe might return a lost group of travelers to the more frequently traveled parts of the desert, again after first taking any valuables as payment.</p><p>The oldest male is the leader of the tribal hunting party and has 4+4 Hit Dice. The oldest female is in charge of the tribal aerie and has 3+3 HD. In tribes that have more than 15 members, the next oldest aarakocra serves as shaman and has 3+3 HD; the shaman completes the triumvirate necessary for proper worship and the summoning of elementals. (Interestingly, no magic-using aarakocra has ever been recorded.) Tribes without a shaman cannot summon <a href=\"/appendix/element1\">air elementals</a>, which is an important part of aarakocra culture.</p><p>The shaman is the leader of the daily sun worship. Aarakocra worship the sun because it provides them with the thermals they need to soar in search of food. The shaman also leads the mystic rituals used to summon an air elemental. Summoning an air elemental is usually done only in preparation for the tribe's most sacred ceremony, the hunt. Small tribes must band together for this ceremony to allow the triumvirate to be formed.</p><p>The ceremony to summon an air elemental must be conducted at dawn and requires the oldest male and female to emit a highpitched keening whistle. The shaman conducts an intricate dance around them, simultaneously chanting an ancient summoning mantra.</p><p>The hunt is the final part of the initiation of adolescent aarakocra to adulthood and often takes the tribe far from their normal teritory. The target is always a <a href=\"/appendix/drakalsi\">silt drake</a>. The hunt is the only time the females leave the relative safety of the nest. Even an evil tribe will not interfere with a tribe on a hunt. An air elemental is often summoned to help find the drake, but never takes part in the actual combat. Although the adult members of the tribe take part in the initial phases of the combat, it is the initiates who deliver the final, killing blows to me drake. Scars from the hunt are considered a mark of pride among all aarakocra.</p><p>The females spend about eight months of the year incubating their eggs. Athasian aarakocra mate for life and a pair normally produces as many as 10 offspring. A female lays one egg a year. Constant incubation is not required because of the high daytime temperatures, so the females can maintain the nest and keep the tribe's treasure in order.</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Ecology:</b> Athasian aarakocra are high on the food chain and have no natural enemies other than <a href=\"/appendix/drakatha\">drakes</a>. Unless evil, aarakocra leave their own territory only to hunt the silt drake and return as soon as possible when the hunt is over. (Evil aarakocra attack others, as noted above.) Aarakocra eggs and hatchlings are sought after by wealthy land owners who wish to use the creatures as scouts and sentries. An egg can bring as much as 10 cp in Tyr's marketplace. Tribes that have had eggs or hatchlings stolen have long memories and sometimes take revenge against the thief at a later date. Captive aarakocra join any tribe they come in contact with.</p><p>Athasian aarakocra have a natural life span of 21-30 years.</p><p></p><br clear=\"all\" style=\"clear:both; height:0;\">\r\n","images":["<img src=\"grf/ds.gif\" width=\"150\" height=\"75\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Dark Sun\" title=\"Dark Sun\" align=\"right\">","<img src=\"img/aarakath.gif\" alt=\"Aarakocra (Athas)\" title=\"Aarakocra (Athas)\" border=\"0\" width=\"300\" height=\"360\" style=\"text-align:right;\" align=\"right\">","<img src=\"grf/add2_01.gif\" width=\"200\" height=\"56\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Advanced Dungeons & Dragons 2nd Edition\">"],"setting":"Dark Sun","statblock":{"Aarakocra (Athas)":{"Activity Cycle":"Day","Alignment":"Any","Armor Class":"7","Climate/Terrain":"Deep desert","Damage/Attack":"1d3/1d3 or by weapon","Diet":"Carnivore","Frequency":"Rare","Hit Dice":"2+2","Intelligence":"Average (8-10)","Magic Resistance":"Nil","Morale":"Steady (11)","Movement":"6, Fl 36 (C)","No. Appearing":"1d10","No. of Attacks":"2","Organization":"Tribal","Size":"M (20'+ wingspan)","Special Attacks":"Nil","Special Defenses":"Nil","THAC0":"17","Treasure":"Varies","XP Value":"65"}},"title":"Aarakocra (Athas)"},"sources":["2433"],"statblock_names":[],"title":"Aarakocra (Athas)","prev_key":"zygraat","next_key":"aarakocr","monster_path":"/appendix/aarakath"}}},"pageContext":{"monster_key":"enduk","monster_data":{"TSR":["2524"],"fullBody":"  <table cellspacing=\"0\" cellpadding=\"0\"><tr><th>Climate/Terrain:</th><td>Tropical forest and mountains</td></tr><tr><th>Frequency:</th><td>Rare</td></tr><tr><th>Organization:</th><td>Family</td></tr><tr><th>Activity Cycle:</th><td>Day</td></tr><tr><th>Diet:</th><td>Omnivore</td></tr><tr><th>Intelligence:</th><td>Average (8-10)</td></tr><tr><th>Treasure:</th><td>P,Q (I)</td></tr><tr><th>Alignment:</th><td>Lawful neutral</td></tr><tr><th>No. Appearing:</th><td>1d6</td></tr><tr><th>Armor Class:</th><td>6</td></tr><tr><th>Movement:</th><td>15, Fl 18 (C)</td></tr><tr><th>Hit Dice:</th><td>4+4</td></tr><tr><th>THAC0:</th><td>15 (leader 13)</td></tr><tr><th>No. of Attacks:</th><td>2</td></tr><tr><th>Damage/Attack:</th><td>1d4+1 (or by weapon)</td></tr><tr><th>Special Attacks:</th><td>Extra weapon</td></tr><tr><th>Special Defenses:</th><td>+1 bonus on surprise rolls</td></tr><tr><th>Magic Resistance:</th><td>Nil</td></tr><tr><th>Size:</th><td>L (6-7' tall)</td></tr><tr><th>Morale:</th><td>Champion (15-16)</td></tr><tr><th>XP Value:</th><td>650<br>Leader: 1,400</td></tr></table><p class=\"f\">Originally from the Savage Coast, these winged minotaurs were driven from their lands on the Orc's Head Peninsula and have only recently returned.</p><p>Standing six to seven feet tall, enduks are smaller and lighter than regular <a href=\"/appendix/minotaur\">minotaurs</a> though still very muscular. Their bodies are covered with short fur ranging from black to light brown. The head of an enduk resembles that of a bull - with horns, a square muzzle, large, heavily-lidded eyes, and a strong mouth filled with large teeth. Long, coarse hair tufts at the throat and shoulders, running in a mane the back. The head of an enduk is most often spotted and splotched with white and black, though features such as the eyes and muzzle are highlighted in brown.</p><p>Enduks also possess huge, powerful wings. A typical enduk wingspan measures from eight to ten feet, and when folded, the wings reach from the ground to one foot over the enduk's head. Feather color varies from white to black, including various shades of gray. The underside of an enduk's wings usually bears a design that they show off by spreading their wings when on the ground. These marks tend to be genetic and can convey information about an enduk's family.</p><p>The enduk have their own language, Nimmush (Homespeak). This guttural, heavy dialect requires a range that few outside their own race can command. Most enduks also know common and Aeshtyn, the language of the <a href=\"/appendix/eeaar\">ee'aar</a>. Though most rarely bother to learn any further languages, some enduks maintain their knowledge of the <a href=\"/appendix/manscorn\">manscorpion's</a> language (Nimmurian), in case it should prove useful in winning back their homeland.</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Combat:</b> The average enduk should be considered a 4th-level warrior, but an enduk leader is at least a 7th-level warrior or cleric (7+7 Hit Dice and THAC0 of 13). Enduks possess a natural AC of 6 and can wear armor if it is made for their winged bodies. Armor with an AC rating of 6 or worse does nothing to enhance an enduk's Armor Class. With armor of AC 5 or better, the armor AC should be used instead of the enduk's, but the armor AC is not added as a bonus. Enduk never use shields of any type.</p><p>While on foot, enduks can attack with any weapon allowed to their class. They prefer weapons of 12 pounds or less, as these can also be used while in the air. Because their size and strength allows them to wield it one-handed with full effect, the two-handed bastard sword is one of their favorite weapons. A few enduks can even wield two of these swords at once, making them fierce and dangerous warriors to contend with. Enduk gain a +2 damage bonus for all normal melee weapons because of their upper-body strength. Enduks do not use regular bows, but they sometimes use heavy crossbows, firing twice per round. In the same round as a melee attack, enduks may attempt to gore opponents with their horns; a successful attack causes 1d4+1 points of damage. An enduk that makes multiple melee attacks in one round cannot attempt to gore.</p><p>Enduks prefer fighting on the ground because they suffer a -2 penalty to all attack rolls while airborne. Weapons must weigh 12 pounds or less to be used in aerial combat, and while crossbows can be fired from the air, the enduk must land to reload. Enduks may not hover, and so they are restricted to passing attacks, sometimes gaining the advantage by gliding down on an unsuspecting enemy. They can land and quickly spring to the attack, gaining a +1 bonus on their surprise rolls.</p><p>A flying enduk can cover 180 feet per round at level flight; one half of their movement must always be committed in a forward direction. Ascending is a strenuous task because of the bulk they are trying to raise. The enduk can ascend only 30 feet for every 90 feet of forward movement. Descending, the enduk can glide their full movement both forward and downward, 180 feet each direction. If diving hard, they can double their movement rate to 360 feet forward and 360 feet downward, never diving at a steeper angle than 45 degrees. Armor does not restrict movement rate or maneuverability; however, armor does apply toward the maximum weight that can be carried in flight.</p><p>While enduks might be limited in their ascent, their strong wings can bear a great deal of extra weight without further penalty. Enduks can carry 200 pounds plus 10 pounds per point of Strength. If an enduk attempts to carry more than this, its movement rate gets cut by half, but maneuverability remains at C. The maximum weight an enduk may carry and still retain the power of flight is 200 pounds plus 20 pounds per point of Strength. However, they can carry up to 30 pounds per point of Strength and still glide (at a maneuverability of D).</p><p>Winged minotaurs must make a Constitution check after every turn of continuous flight. Failure indicates that the enduk must glide downward and land, resting one turn for each two turns previously spent flying. Constitution checks are subject to a penalty of -1 for every 100 pounds of weight carried above the initial 100 pounds. A further -1 penalty applies at heights above 5,000 feet. Enduks can never rise above 10,000 feet. Under favorable wind conditions, they gain a +2 bonus to their Constitution check.</p><p>Direct damage to the wings affects an enduk the same way it affects an ee'aar. For example, an enduk warrior with 40 hit points takes 23 points of direct damage to its wings and 8 more in general body damage. It has lost more than 50% of its total hit points in wing damage and more than 75% total, both of these losses keeping it from flying. Even if healing spells bring the enduk back to full hit points, ready to enter battle again, the damage to its wings still prevents flight. After one week, the enduk regains 4 hit points (10% of 40 total hp), bringing the wing damage down to 19 points, allowing the enduk to glide. However, as this total is still greater than 25% of the enduk's hit point total, actual flight is impossible. The enduk still requires two more weeks of healing before the feathers have grown in enough to allow full flight.</p><p>If the enduk possesses a Constitution of at least 17, it heals an additional 3 hit points per week for wing damage. In this situation, the enduk would be fully capable of flight exactly two weeks from the injury. A heal spell would both regrow feathers and heal damage, allowing immediate flight.</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Habitat/Society:</b> The enduks have always been a simple, trusting people with a system of deeply felt religious beliefs. When the manscorpions were originally driven from their lands, the enduk agreed to share Nimmur with them. When betrayed by these manscorpions, the enduks fled their homeland and relocated on the Arm of the Immortals with the assistance of their friends, the ee'aar. There they sought to both preserve their simple lifestyle and prepare to battle for claim to Nimmur.</p><p>The enduks put family ahead of other concerns. Enduks take a mate for life, rarely taking a second even if the first dies. A couple will average one child every few years - four to six young over their lifetime together. Normally one enduk represents the entire extended family for purposes of organized government, whether it is a local  organization or a temporary clan-council responsible for matters concerning all enduks. (The last clan-council to be held was over the matter of returning to Nimmur.) This leader is generally an enduk who has lost a mate, or never took one, and has embraced a more martial and possibly religious lifestyle. Sometimes, a mated pair will devote their lives to such pursuits, both becoming leaders for the family.</p><p>Enduk are typically stoic creatures unless enraged. They get along well with all other races except the manscorpions, who have possibly earned the eternal animosity of the enduks. Their philosophy demands an ascetic life of peasantry, which ties in with the enduk religion - worship of their patron Immortal, Ixion, and reverence of their greatest leader, Gildesh. Gildesh supposedly returns every 300 years to live among his people, constantly renewing their faith. In his latest reincarnation, Gildesh led his people back to the Savage Coast to reclaim their homeland. Not the fanatic killers the manscorpions can be, the enduks and their ee'aar allies were only able to gain a foothold. They now hold Um-Shedu and the surrounding land. Enduks in this area are more likely to be mistrusting and militant. Some of their people have returned to the land and become farmers, but the population of Um-Shedu is supported mainly by the enduks remaining on the Arm of the Immortals.</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Ecology:</b> The enduks would like nothing more than to live in peace with their neighbors, raising crops and hunting for meat as needed. However, that choice has been taken from them, and for the time being, the enduks are pursuing this war with vigor. Unless the manscorpions make amends for their actions, the violence is likely to continue until one race or the other is destroyed.</p><p>Besides the killing, this conflict has forced the enduks into a higher level of craftsmanship and commerce. The enduks are natural metalsmiths, making some of the best tools and weapons available. Mostly they work with regular steel, but with their return to the Savage Coast, they have begun crafting red steel weapons. Enduks do not make items specifically for trade with other races yet, so most weapons and tools are created for enduk physique. Still, these items are gaining a following in the surrounding lands as trade items.</p><p></p><br clear=\"all\" style=\"clear:both; height:0;\">\r\n","images":["<img src=\"grf/rs.gif\" width=\"150\" height=\"75\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Red Steel (Mystara)\" title=\"Red Steel (Mystara)\" align=\"right\">","<img src=\"img/enduk.gif\" alt=\"Enduk\" title=\"Enduk\" border=\"0\" width=\"300\" height=\"360\" style=\"text-align:right;\" align=\"right\">","<img src=\"grf/add2_01.gif\" width=\"200\" height=\"56\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Advanced Dungeons & Dragons 2nd Edition\">"],"setting":"Red Steel (Mystara)","statblock":{"Enduk":{"Activity Cycle":"Day","Alignment":"Lawful neutral","Armor Class":"6","Climate/Terrain":"Tropical forest and mountains","Damage/Attack":"1d4+1 (or by weapon)","Diet":"Omnivore","Frequency":"Rare","Hit Dice":"4+4","Intelligence":"Average (8-10)","Magic Resistance":"Nil","Morale":"Champion (15-16)","Movement":"15, Fl 18 (C)","No. Appearing":"1d6","No. of Attacks":"2","Organization":"Family","Size":"L (6-7' tall)","Special Attacks":"Extra weapon","Special Defenses":"+1 bonus on surprise rolls","THAC0":"15 (leader 13)","Treasure":"P,Q (I)","XP Value":"650<br>Leader: 1,400"}},"title":"Enduk"},"sources":["2524"],"statblock_names":[],"title":"Enduk","prev_key":"elmarin","next_key":"entrope","monster_path":"/appendix/enduk"}},"staticQueryHashes":[],"slicesMap":{}}
