While the powers listed above are the most common, some aarakocra have different or additional powers.</p><p class=\"f\">A race of intelligent, birdlike creatures living in the deepest deserts of Athas, the rare Athasian <a href=\"/appendix/aarakocr\">aarakocra</a> spends its time soaring on thermals in search of food.</p><p>The aarakocra is 7 to 8 feet tall with a wingspan of 20 feet or more. Because of its large wingspan, an aarakocra can carry as much as 75% of its own body weight and still fly easily. An aarakocra can fly a short distance carrying a burden equaling 125% of its own body weight. The average body weight of a full grown male is 100 pounds and a female is 85 pounds.</p><p>Each wing has a &ldquo;hand&rdquo; at its midpoint, consisting of three fingers and an opposable thumb. The fourth finger forms the rigid leading edge of the wing. In flight the hands cannot be used, but on the ground the aarakocra can use its hands almost as a human would. The aarakocra's body is protected by a thin bony plate on the chest, much like a solid rib cage. Talons on its legs can be used as claws and can be retracted to reveal a second set of hands, also with three fingers and an opposable thumb. Except for the chest plate, the entire skeleton is hollow and extremely fragile.</p><p>From a distance, the Athasian aarakocra resembles a huge <a href=\"/appendix/bird\">vulture</a>. Its black eyes, set in the front of the head, provide excellent vision over a long range. The plumage is generally black with a white collar for adult males and black or brown with a smaller white collar for females. Adolescents are a mixture of brown and black. The beak is large and covers most of the head. Plumage begins at the crown of the head and is darker near the head, except for the collar. Athasian aarakocra speak their own language and the languages of vultures and other large birds. Some speak the common tongue (5% to 10% chance depending on how deep in the wastelands a tribe lives).</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Combat:</b> Aarakocra can fight in the air or on the ground. They prefer aerial combat since their bones are too fragile to withstand a solid blow from a human-sized opponent. In combat against creatures on the ground, they prefer to fly over their victim and drop weighted nets. Some aarakocra use darts to harass ground-based opponents.</p><p>If their opponents can fly, the aarakocra generally forgo the use of the net, although large groups sometimes use nets on flying creatures. Normally, aarakocra attack flying creatures with long spears, diving from above and allowing the momentum to carry the spear through the target. Such an attack doubles the damage if the aarakocra have been able to dive at least 50 feet. Only the very largest aarakocra can carry more than one of these spears, they can attack with both at once with no penalty, causing double damage on each strike. All diving attacks are made at +4 and should be treated as a charge attack. All other penalties and restrictions of charge attacks apply.</p><p>The effect of the aarakocra's nets depends on if the opponent is flying at the time it becomes entangled. Creatures on the ground that are hit by a net are entangled and unable to participate in any combat until they make a successful Strength check to get free of the net. Flying creatures hit by a net can no longer fly and immediately begin falling. If they cannot escape the net or use some magical means to arrest the fall, normal falling damage applies.</p><p>Unless victims are entangled in nets, aarakocra are cautious in ground combat. If the aarakocra outnumber their opponents they advance in a straight line and thrust with their spears. If outnumbered, or the opponents are particularly tough, the aarakocra withdraw. Victims entangled in nets are killed or incapacitated for use as food or ransom.</p><p>Athasian aarakocra are mindful of their physical limitations as well as their comparatively low psionic abilities. They do not normally initiate psionic combat. At the first sign of psionic powers from any of their victims, however, all aarakocra that have some ability will use whatever attack and defense modes they can in an attempt to destroy the threat. Large groups of is or more aarakocra may initiate psionic combat if their leaders feel they can win quickly and avoid physical combat.</p><p>In desperation, an aarakocra can attempt to bite an opponent in combat. Because of the unwieldiness of its beak, the aarakocra has a THAC0 of 18 if attacking with this appendage. Further, the birdman causes only 1d2 points of damage with the beak.</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Habitat/Society:</b> Athasian aarakocra live in tribes with 6-20 (2d8+4) members, depending on the prestige of the leader. The largest tribe ever recorded had 50 members. The tribal hunting territory depends on the size of the tribe, usually about 500 square miles for a tribe of 10 members. There are no rigid boundaries between tribes and border disputes are not uncommon.</p><p>Alignments of tribe members are similar to the alignment of the leader. A tribe that has a leader who is neutral good may have neutral good, chaotic good, lawful good, and true neutral members. A predominantly evil tribe does not recognize boundaries with other tribes and treats other tribes as inferior beings to be eliminated.</p><p>Athasian aarakocra aren't happy in enclosed spaces, but they they take refuge in a cave or building if necessary.</p><p>Nonevil tribes live in rocky aeries in the highest peaks they can find. Evil tribes are normally nomadic and use an aerie made by another tribe if they need to remain in an area for a long time, even if they have to evict the tribe that made the nest.</p><p>Aarakocra aren't friendly toward intruders in their territory, especially caravans. They try to extract a toll from the caravan for passage through the desert. Good-aligned tribes allow unhindered passage of caravans that pay a tribute. If someone refuses to pay the tribute, the aarakocra try to capture scouts or outriders from the party and hold them until an even larger tribute is paid. The payment may be either livestock or shiny objects. Aarakocra are smart enough not to be taken in by glass baubles instead of gems, although they cannot tell the difference between the more common gems and the rare ones.</p><p>Evil tribes ask for tribute and often attack a caravan whether it pays or not. Aarakocra always demand shiny objects such as stones. These tribes find humans and demihumans to be quite tasty and prefer them to other food.</p><p>Good-aligned tribes of aarakocra sometimes return a lost traveler to the edge of the desert after first removing any valuables the traveler may be carrying. On very rare occasions a tribe might return a lost group of travelers to the more frequently traveled parts of the desert, again after first taking any valuables as payment.</p><p>The oldest male is the leader of the tribal hunting party and has 4+4 Hit Dice. The oldest female is in charge of the tribal aerie and has 3+3 HD. In tribes that have more than 15 members, the next oldest aarakocra serves as shaman and has 3+3 HD; the shaman completes the triumvirate necessary for proper worship and the summoning of elementals. (Interestingly, no magic-using aarakocra has ever been recorded.) Tribes without a shaman cannot summon <a href=\"/appendix/element1\">air elementals</a>, which is an important part of aarakocra culture.</p><p>The shaman is the leader of the daily sun worship. Aarakocra worship the sun because it provides them with the thermals they need to soar in search of food. The shaman also leads the mystic rituals used to summon an air elemental. Summoning an air elemental is usually done only in preparation for the tribe's most sacred ceremony, the hunt. Small tribes must band together for this ceremony to allow the triumvirate to be formed.</p><p>The ceremony to summon an air elemental must be conducted at dawn and requires the oldest male and female to emit a highpitched keening whistle. The shaman conducts an intricate dance around them, simultaneously chanting an ancient summoning mantra.</p><p>The hunt is the final part of the initiation of adolescent aarakocra to adulthood and often takes the tribe far from their normal teritory. The target is always a <a href=\"/appendix/drakalsi\">silt drake</a>. The hunt is the only time the females leave the relative safety of the nest. Even an evil tribe will not interfere with a tribe on a hunt. An air elemental is often summoned to help find the drake, but never takes part in the actual combat. Although the adult members of the tribe take part in the initial phases of the combat, it is the initiates who deliver the final, killing blows to me drake. Scars from the hunt are considered a mark of pride among all aarakocra.</p><p>The females spend about eight months of the year incubating their eggs. Athasian aarakocra mate for life and a pair normally produces as many as 10 offspring. A female lays one egg a year. Constant incubation is not required because of the high daytime temperatures, so the females can maintain the nest and keep the tribe's treasure in order.</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Ecology:</b> Athasian aarakocra are high on the food chain and have no natural enemies other than <a href=\"/appendix/drakatha\">drakes</a>. Unless evil, aarakocra leave their own territory only to hunt the silt drake and return as soon as possible when the hunt is over. (Evil aarakocra attack others, as noted above.) Aarakocra eggs and hatchlings are sought after by wealthy land owners who wish to use the creatures as scouts and sentries. An egg can bring as much as 10 cp in Tyr's marketplace. Tribes that have had eggs or hatchlings stolen have long memories and sometimes take revenge against the thief at a later date. Captive aarakocra join any tribe they come in contact with.</p><p>Athasian aarakocra have a natural life span of 21-30 years.</p><br clear=\"all\" style=\"clear:both; height:0;\">\r\n","images":["<img src=\"grf/ds.gif\" width=\"150\" height=\"75\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Dark Sun\" title=\"Dark Sun\" align=\"right\">","<img src=\"img/aarakath.gif\" alt=\"Aarakocra (Athas)\" title=\"Aarakocra (Athas)\" border=\"0\" width=\"300\" height=\"360\" style=\"text-align:right;\" align=\"right\">","<img src=\"grf/add2_01.gif\" width=\"200\" height=\"56\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Advanced Dungeons & Dragons 2nd Edition\">"],"setting":"Dark Sun","statblock":{"Aarakocra (Athas)":{"Activity Cycle":"Day","Alignment":"Any","Armor Class":"7","Climate/Terrain":"Deep desert","Damage/Attack":"1d3/1d3 or by weapon","Diet":"Carnivore","Frequency":"Rare","Hit Dice":"2+2","Intelligence":"Average (8-10)","Magic Resistance":"Nil","Morale":"Steady (11)","Movement":"6, Fl 36 (C)","No. Appearing":"1d10","No. of Attacks":"2","Organization":"Tribal","Size":"M (20'+ wingspan)","Special Attacks":"Nil","Special Defenses":"Nil","THAC0":"17","Treasure":"Varies","XP Value":"65"}},"title":"Aarakocra (Athas)"},"sources":["2433"],"statblock_names":[],"title":"Aarakocra (Athas)","prev_key":"zygraat","next_key":"aarakocr","monster_path":"/appendix/aarakath"}}},"pageContext":{"monster_key":"animhera","monster_data":{"TSR":["2405"],"fullBody":"  <table cellspacing=\"0\" cellpadding=\"0\"><tr class=\"bk\"><th> </th><th class=\"cn\">Kip</th><th class=\"cn\">Z'tal</th><th class=\"cn\">Jankz</th></tr><tr><th>Climate/Terrain:</th><td>Scrub Plains</td><td>Any</td><td>Sandy wastes, stony barrens</td></tr><tr><th>Frequency:</th><td>Common</td><td>Common</td><td>Common</td></tr><tr><th>Organization:</th><td>Herd</td><td>Leap</td><td>Community</td></tr><tr><th>Activity Cycle:</th><td>Night</td><td>Day</td><td>Night</td></tr><tr><th>Diet:</th><td>Omnivore</td><td>Omnivore</td><td>Herbivore</td></tr><tr><th>Intelligence:</th><td>Animal (1)</td><td>Non- (0)</td><td>Animal (1)</td></tr><tr><th>Treasure:</th><td>See below</td><td>See below</td><td>K,Q,U</td></tr><tr><th>Alignment:</th><td>Neutral</td><td>Neutral</td><td>Neutral</td></tr><tr><th>No. Appearing:</th><td>1-100</td><td>1-20</td><td>1-1000</td></tr><tr><th>Armor Class:</th><td>4</td><td>5</td><td>6</td></tr><tr><th>Movement:</th><td>6</td><td>12</td><td>12</td></tr><tr><th>Hit Dice:</th><td>1+2</td><td>2+2</td><td>1+1</td></tr><tr><th>THAC0:</th><td>19</td><td>19</td><td>19</td></tr><tr><th>No. of Attacks:</th><td>2</td><td>2</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><th>Damage/Attack:</th><td>1-3</td><td>1, 1-6</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><th>Special Attacks:</th><td>Pheromones</td><td>Sonics</td><td>Poison</td></tr><tr><th>Special Defenses:</th><td>Pheromones</td><td>Sonics</td><td>Nil</td></tr><tr><th>Magic Resistance:</th><td>Nil</td><td>Nil</td><td>Nil</td></tr><tr><th>Size:</th><td>S (2-4')</td><td>S (2-3')</td><td>T (1')</td></tr><tr><th>Morale:</th><td>Average (8)</td><td>Unsteady (5)</td><td>Steady (11)</td></tr><tr><th>XP Value:</th><td>65</td><td>120</td><td>35</td></tr></table><p class=\"f\">Many animals are used on Athas for food, clothing, or weapons. Some have been partially domesticated or are stupid enough to allow themselves to be captured and herded.</p><h2>Kip</h2><p class=\"f\">The kip is a shy, six-legged, armored creature that digs and eats roots of plants and trees. Their supple, armor-like covering makes excellent durable leather goods.</p><p>The leathered kip grows from 2'-4' in length. Kips are covered with a horny armor that is segmented into nine separate plates. They have elongated, pointed snouts and very small, beady eyes located on each side of their snouts. The eyes are protected by a glass-like covering that protects them while digging. The sharp, strong foreclaws enable the creature to dig. Their short, stubby, hind legs only allow them to amble around slowly.</p><p>Kips communicate via a series of low grunts. Although not a true language, <a href=\"/appendix/dwaratha\">dwarven</a> kip-herders have learned to mimic the sounds in order to better control the herd. Kip language can be learned at a cost of a single non-weapon proficiency slot. As with other languages, a simple check should be made against a character's Intelligence for successful communication. Failure means: 1) the kip doesn't understand and ignores the attempted communication; 2) the wrong information is conveyed.</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Combat:</b> Kips are generally non-combatant and prefer to amble away when approached. Thus, they are easily herded. They will only fight if cornered or to protect their young. Kips use pheromones to protect themselves. Pheromones are secreted chemicals that produce an emotional response in the victim. Once a day a kip can release an 8-cubic-foot cloud of invisible, gaseous chemicals. Creatures within the gas cloud must save versus poison or suffer apathy. If effected, the victim will cease caring about anything, including drinking water, for a period of 1d8 turns. Exposed creatures or individuals can be herded along or made to drink, but they really don't care if they live or die. Because of their high resistance to poison and the ability to focus, dwarves are +4 on their saving throws against the pheromone cloud.</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Habitat/Society:</b> Kips bear offspring twice a year. A litter will contain 2-6 leatherettes, which mature in 3-5 months. Until mobile, the young fasten themselves to folds in the mother's skin and ride along with her as she moves. Kip are one of the few creatures on Athas that eat brambleweed, as their armor temporarily protects them as they dig out and expose the sweet roots.</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Ecology:</b> Kip herds provide a staple of meat and leather goods in most dwarven communities. Roasted, an adult kip will feed two very hungry dwarves; made into a stew, the meat and broth will easily feed six. Kips and dwarves seem to be complementary in pace and temperament. Dwarven communities keep the kip herd in a slow, constant motion since kip tend to destroy roots of growing plants. Their elongated, pointy snouts and keen sense of smell aid them in their search for food. Kips will eat anything that doesn't put up a fight, including garbage.</p><p>Dwarves with animal husbandry skill can safely milk the pheromones from an adult, but the chemical will lose all potency within 48 hours. Only a small amount of pheromonal fluid can be milked from each animal. A turn spent milking a kip will produce enough fluid to create a small (one cubic foot) pheromone cloud.</p><h2>Z'tal</h2><p class=\"f\">Z'tal are small, upright <a href=\"/appendix/lizard\">lizards</a> that hop in shepherded leaps across Athas. They are very stupid and are known to stampede when panicked.</p><p>Z'tal jump wherever they go on powerful hind legs that end in sharp talons. Their small head is rounded in the back with a sharp, hard point on the end. Their long, thick tail is used for balance when they hop. The vestigial forearms and claws are seldom used. Varying in shades of tans and browns, z'tal are covered by sharp, feather-like scales.</p><p>Z'tal constantly make a series of chirps, squeaks, and squawks. These noises are intended predominantly to keep the herd within a single area. When threatened, z'tal scream and run.</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Combat:</b> Z'tal emit a piercing scream when frightened. The sonic intensity of the scream is so great that any being with normal hearing within a 100' range must save versus petrification or be overcome by vertigo. A successful save means that the victim is able to fight off the effects, but suffers a -2 to any rolls that require concentration (fighting, spellcasting, psionics, etc.). A failed save drops the victim to the ground unable to determine which direction is up. No combat, psionics, or spellcasting is possible until the creatures stop screaming or move out of range. Covering one's ears before the scream gives a +2 bonus to the saving throw. Filling the ears with wax, cotton, or some other substance adds a +4 bonus to the saving throw. Silence magics may negate the vertigo effects. The deaf are unaffected.</p><p>In desperate situations, the z'tal will defend itself by rapidly bouncing or rubbing against its adversary, scraping its razorsharp scales against its opponent and causing 1d6 damage per round. The peck of a z'tal only causes a single point of damage.</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Habitat/Society:</b> Z'tals are well suited for life in the desert. They require little water and can sustain themselves through foraging. Z'tal travel in groups called leaps and are acknowledged as perhaps the most stupid and timid of creatures on Athas. They sometimes accidentally die by running off cliffs or into the Sea of Silt if chased.</p><p>About once a month the female digs a small hole and lays a clutch of 1-3 eggs. The eggs are immediately forgotten and left to fend for themselves. The eggs are not edible by any known creature because z'tals' scales develop almost immediately after conception.</p><p>The rear talons of z'tal are used to dig out small insects and seedlings, which the z'tal crushes with its beak. Docile creatures except when frightened, one screaming z'tal will soon stampede the entire leap of lizards.</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Ecology:</b> Z'tal meat is dense and coarse, though the hind quarters (drumsticks) and tail of an adult z'tal make excellent eating (once the scales have been carefully removed). Roasted, the three pieces will feed six hungry individuals or one half-giant. Z'tal meat makes an excellent base for soup; a single z'tal cooked this way will easily feed a dozen hungry, man-sized creatures. The sharp, flexible feather-scales are frequently used as small knives and razors. The scales dull after a week of regular use and can not be resharpened.</p><h2>Jankx</h2><p class=\"f\">These furred mammals live in burrow communities in the desert. Although they represent a possible prime source of food or clothing, most people think they are too dangerous to bother.</p><p>Standing about 1' tall on their hind legs, jankx have a small, pointy head and internal cheek pouches that allow them to carry food or water when they run. Jankx have long, sleek bodies and four short, muscular legs. Golden in color, their pelts are highly prized for trade.</p><p>Jankx communicate in a series of ultrasonic squeaks and barks that are inaudible to humanoid ears.</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Combat:</b> Jankx have spurs and poison sacs located on the underside of each limb near the paw. In combat a jankx will attempt to hook its adversary with a spur. The spur attack inflicts 1d2 points of damage per hit. A successful hit also means that the poison has been injected (save vs. poison for no effect). If the victim fails to save, tremendous pain follows as the area injected with the poison begins to wither (limb, torso, head, etc.) Only the region in which the poison was injected will be effected; the thick poison does not travel throughout the entire body. The effected area will shrivel and become useless at a rate of 1' diameter per round. The poison can be negated by <i>neutralize poison</i>; <i>slow poison</i> will limit the effects to 1' per hour. The victim is capable of no other action except to scream in pain until the poison runs its course. If injected into the head, the poison will cause the unfortunate victim to lose one point of Intelligence per turn until their intelligence reaches zero. The victim then becomes comatose and will eventually die of starvation.</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Habitat/Society:</b> Jankx live in a complex community of underground passageways. Their burrows contain different living, storage, and sleeping areas. Food storage and deep water supplies are always closely guarded. Traditional family units' tunnels always interconnect with other jankx families. Jankx sleep through the day and emerge at dusk for a night of foraging. Their small paws are very well evolved for digging and handling small items.</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Ecology:</b> Those who consider themselves jankx &ldquo;herders&rdquo; are more trappers than anything. Jankx are usually snared when they are on their nightly forays. A herder hovel is always built either above ground or on solid stone to prevent jankx from burrowing underneath the hovel and killing the herder. Jankx meat is considered gamey but palatable. Due to the difficult position of the poison sacs, caution should be taken in preparing jankx meat. A general rule is one jankx for <a href=\"/appendix/elfathas\">elves</a> and humans, more for others. Caution must always be exercised when cooking jankx meat. When cooked, the burning flesh emits an odor that sends any nearby jankx into a rage. If cooked too close to a jankx community, a horde of jankx will invariably find the source of the odor and attack the diners.</p><br clear=\"all\" style=\"clear:both; height:0;\">\r\n","images":["<img src=\"grf/ds.gif\" width=\"150\" height=\"75\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Dark Sun\" title=\"Dark Sun\" align=\"right\">","<img src=\"img/animhera.gif\" alt=\"Animal, Herd (Athas)\" title=\"Animal, Herd (Athas)\" border=\"0\" width=\"300\" height=\"360\" style=\"text-align:right;\" align=\"right\">","<img src=\"grf/add2_01.gif\" width=\"200\" height=\"56\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Advanced Dungeons & Dragons 2nd Edition\">"],"setting":"Dark Sun","statblock":{"Jankz":{"Activity Cycle":"Night","Alignment":"Neutral","Armor Class":"6","Climate/Terrain":"Sandy wastes, stony barrens","Damage/Attack":"1","Diet":"Herbivore","Frequency":"Common","Hit Dice":"1+1","Intelligence":"Animal (1)","Magic Resistance":"Nil","Morale":"Steady (11)","Movement":"12","No. Appearing":"1-1000","No. of Attacks":"1","Organization":"Community","Size":"T (1')","Special Attacks":"Poison","Special Defenses":"Nil","THAC0":"19","Treasure":"K,Q,U","XP Value":"35"},"Kip":{"Activity Cycle":"Night","Alignment":"Neutral","Armor Class":"4","Climate/Terrain":"Scrub Plains","Damage/Attack":"1-3","Diet":"Omnivore","Frequency":"Common","Hit Dice":"1+2","Intelligence":"Animal (1)","Magic Resistance":"Nil","Morale":"Average (8)","Movement":"6","No. Appearing":"1-100","No. of Attacks":"2","Organization":"Herd","Size":"S (2-4')","Special Attacks":"Pheromones","Special Defenses":"Pheromones","THAC0":"19","Treasure":"See below","XP Value":"65"},"Z'tal":{"Activity Cycle":"Day","Alignment":"Neutral","Armor Class":"5","Climate/Terrain":"Any","Damage/Attack":"1, 1-6","Diet":"Omnivore","Frequency":"Common","Hit Dice":"2+2","Intelligence":"Non- (0)","Magic Resistance":"Nil","Morale":"Unsteady (5)","Movement":"12","No. Appearing":"1-20","No. of Attacks":"2","Organization":"Leap","Size":"S (2-3')","Special Attacks":"Sonics","Special Defenses":"Sonics","THAC0":"19","Treasure":"See below","XP Value":"120"}},"title":"Animal, Herd (Athas)"},"sources":["2405"],"statblock_names":[],"title":"Animal, Herd (Athas)","prev_key":"animenta","next_key":"animhoua","monster_path":"/appendix/animhera"}},"staticQueryHashes":[],"slicesMap":{}}
