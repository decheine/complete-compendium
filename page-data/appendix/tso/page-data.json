While the powers listed above are the most common, some aarakocra have different or additional powers.</p><p class=\"f\">A race of intelligent, birdlike creatures living in the deepest deserts of Athas, the rare Athasian <a href=\"/appendix/aarakocr\">aarakocra</a> spends its time soaring on thermals in search of food.</p><p>The aarakocra is 7 to 8 feet tall with a wingspan of 20 feet or more. Because of its large wingspan, an aarakocra can carry as much as 75% of its own body weight and still fly easily. An aarakocra can fly a short distance carrying a burden equaling 125% of its own body weight. The average body weight of a full grown male is 100 pounds and a female is 85 pounds.</p><p>Each wing has a &ldquo;hand&rdquo; at its midpoint, consisting of three fingers and an opposable thumb. The fourth finger forms the rigid leading edge of the wing. In flight the hands cannot be used, but on the ground the aarakocra can use its hands almost as a human would. The aarakocra's body is protected by a thin bony plate on the chest, much like a solid rib cage. Talons on its legs can be used as claws and can be retracted to reveal a second set of hands, also with three fingers and an opposable thumb. Except for the chest plate, the entire skeleton is hollow and extremely fragile.</p><p>From a distance, the Athasian aarakocra resembles a huge <a href=\"/appendix/bird\">vulture</a>. Its black eyes, set in the front of the head, provide excellent vision over a long range. The plumage is generally black with a white collar for adult males and black or brown with a smaller white collar for females. Adolescents are a mixture of brown and black. The beak is large and covers most of the head. Plumage begins at the crown of the head and is darker near the head, except for the collar. Athasian aarakocra speak their own language and the languages of vultures and other large birds. Some speak the common tongue (5% to 10% chance depending on how deep in the wastelands a tribe lives).</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Combat:</b> Aarakocra can fight in the air or on the ground. They prefer aerial combat since their bones are too fragile to withstand a solid blow from a human-sized opponent. In combat against creatures on the ground, they prefer to fly over their victim and drop weighted nets. Some aarakocra use darts to harass ground-based opponents.</p><p>If their opponents can fly, the aarakocra generally forgo the use of the net, although large groups sometimes use nets on flying creatures. Normally, aarakocra attack flying creatures with long spears, diving from above and allowing the momentum to carry the spear through the target. Such an attack doubles the damage if the aarakocra have been able to dive at least 50 feet. Only the very largest aarakocra can carry more than one of these spears, they can attack with both at once with no penalty, causing double damage on each strike. All diving attacks are made at +4 and should be treated as a charge attack. All other penalties and restrictions of charge attacks apply.</p><p>The effect of the aarakocra's nets depends on if the opponent is flying at the time it becomes entangled. Creatures on the ground that are hit by a net are entangled and unable to participate in any combat until they make a successful Strength check to get free of the net. Flying creatures hit by a net can no longer fly and immediately begin falling. If they cannot escape the net or use some magical means to arrest the fall, normal falling damage applies.</p><p>Unless victims are entangled in nets, aarakocra are cautious in ground combat. If the aarakocra outnumber their opponents they advance in a straight line and thrust with their spears. If outnumbered, or the opponents are particularly tough, the aarakocra withdraw. Victims entangled in nets are killed or incapacitated for use as food or ransom.</p><p>Athasian aarakocra are mindful of their physical limitations as well as their comparatively low psionic abilities. They do not normally initiate psionic combat. At the first sign of psionic powers from any of their victims, however, all aarakocra that have some ability will use whatever attack and defense modes they can in an attempt to destroy the threat. Large groups of is or more aarakocra may initiate psionic combat if their leaders feel they can win quickly and avoid physical combat.</p><p>In desperation, an aarakocra can attempt to bite an opponent in combat. Because of the unwieldiness of its beak, the aarakocra has a THAC0 of 18 if attacking with this appendage. Further, the birdman causes only 1d2 points of damage with the beak.</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Habitat/Society:</b> Athasian aarakocra live in tribes with 6-20 (2d8+4) members, depending on the prestige of the leader. The largest tribe ever recorded had 50 members. The tribal hunting territory depends on the size of the tribe, usually about 500 square miles for a tribe of 10 members. There are no rigid boundaries between tribes and border disputes are not uncommon.</p><p>Alignments of tribe members are similar to the alignment of the leader. A tribe that has a leader who is neutral good may have neutral good, chaotic good, lawful good, and true neutral members. A predominantly evil tribe does not recognize boundaries with other tribes and treats other tribes as inferior beings to be eliminated.</p><p>Athasian aarakocra aren't happy in enclosed spaces, but they they take refuge in a cave or building if necessary.</p><p>Nonevil tribes live in rocky aeries in the highest peaks they can find. Evil tribes are normally nomadic and use an aerie made by another tribe if they need to remain in an area for a long time, even if they have to evict the tribe that made the nest.</p><p>Aarakocra aren't friendly toward intruders in their territory, especially caravans. They try to extract a toll from the caravan for passage through the desert. Good-aligned tribes allow unhindered passage of caravans that pay a tribute. If someone refuses to pay the tribute, the aarakocra try to capture scouts or outriders from the party and hold them until an even larger tribute is paid. The payment may be either livestock or shiny objects. Aarakocra are smart enough not to be taken in by glass baubles instead of gems, although they cannot tell the difference between the more common gems and the rare ones.</p><p>Evil tribes ask for tribute and often attack a caravan whether it pays or not. Aarakocra always demand shiny objects such as stones. These tribes find humans and demihumans to be quite tasty and prefer them to other food.</p><p>Good-aligned tribes of aarakocra sometimes return a lost traveler to the edge of the desert after first removing any valuables the traveler may be carrying. On very rare occasions a tribe might return a lost group of travelers to the more frequently traveled parts of the desert, again after first taking any valuables as payment.</p><p>The oldest male is the leader of the tribal hunting party and has 4+4 Hit Dice. The oldest female is in charge of the tribal aerie and has 3+3 HD. In tribes that have more than 15 members, the next oldest aarakocra serves as shaman and has 3+3 HD; the shaman completes the triumvirate necessary for proper worship and the summoning of elementals. (Interestingly, no magic-using aarakocra has ever been recorded.) Tribes without a shaman cannot summon <a href=\"/appendix/element1\">air elementals</a>, which is an important part of aarakocra culture.</p><p>The shaman is the leader of the daily sun worship. Aarakocra worship the sun because it provides them with the thermals they need to soar in search of food. The shaman also leads the mystic rituals used to summon an air elemental. Summoning an air elemental is usually done only in preparation for the tribe's most sacred ceremony, the hunt. Small tribes must band together for this ceremony to allow the triumvirate to be formed.</p><p>The ceremony to summon an air elemental must be conducted at dawn and requires the oldest male and female to emit a highpitched keening whistle. The shaman conducts an intricate dance around them, simultaneously chanting an ancient summoning mantra.</p><p>The hunt is the final part of the initiation of adolescent aarakocra to adulthood and often takes the tribe far from their normal teritory. The target is always a <a href=\"/appendix/drakalsi\">silt drake</a>. The hunt is the only time the females leave the relative safety of the nest. Even an evil tribe will not interfere with a tribe on a hunt. An air elemental is often summoned to help find the drake, but never takes part in the actual combat. Although the adult members of the tribe take part in the initial phases of the combat, it is the initiates who deliver the final, killing blows to me drake. Scars from the hunt are considered a mark of pride among all aarakocra.</p><p>The females spend about eight months of the year incubating their eggs. Athasian aarakocra mate for life and a pair normally produces as many as 10 offspring. A female lays one egg a year. Constant incubation is not required because of the high daytime temperatures, so the females can maintain the nest and keep the tribe's treasure in order.</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Ecology:</b> Athasian aarakocra are high on the food chain and have no natural enemies other than <a href=\"/appendix/drakatha\">drakes</a>. Unless evil, aarakocra leave their own territory only to hunt the silt drake and return as soon as possible when the hunt is over. (Evil aarakocra attack others, as noted above.) Aarakocra eggs and hatchlings are sought after by wealthy land owners who wish to use the creatures as scouts and sentries. An egg can bring as much as 10 cp in Tyr's marketplace. Tribes that have had eggs or hatchlings stolen have long memories and sometimes take revenge against the thief at a later date. Captive aarakocra join any tribe they come in contact with.</p><p>Athasian aarakocra have a natural life span of 21-30 years.</p>\n","images":["<img src=\"grf/ds.gif\" width=\"150\" height=\"75\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Dark Sun\" title=\"Dark Sun\" align=\"right\">","<img src=\"img/aarakath.gif\" alt=\"Aarakocra (Athas)\" title=\"Aarakocra (Athas)\" border=\"0\" width=\"300\" height=\"360\" style=\"text-align:right;\" align=\"right\">","<img src=\"grf/add2_01.gif\" width=\"200\" height=\"56\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Advanced Dungeons & Dragons 2nd Edition\">"],"setting":"Dark Sun","statblock":{"Aarakocra (Athas)":{"Activity Cycle":"Day","Alignment":"Any","Armor Class":"7","Climate/Terrain":"Deep desert","Damage/Attack":"1d3/1d3 or by weapon","Diet":"Carnivore","Frequency":"Rare","Hit Dice":"2+2","Intelligence":"Average (8-10)","Magic Resistance":"Nil","Morale":"Steady (11)","Movement":"6, Fl 36 (C)","No. Appearing":"1d10","No. of Attacks":"2","Organization":"Tribal","Size":"M (20'+ wingspan)","Special Attacks":"Nil","Special Defenses":"Nil","THAC0":"17","Treasure":"Varies","XP Value":"65"}},"title":"Aarakocra (Athas)"},"sources":["2433"],"statblock_names":[],"title":"Aarakocra (Athas)","prev_key":"zygraat","next_key":"aarakocr","monster_path":"/appendix/aarakath"}}},"pageContext":{"monster_key":"tso","monster_data":{"TSR":["2613"],"fullBody":"  <table cellspacing=\"0\" cellpadding=\"0\"><tr><th>Climate/Terrain:</th><td>Outlands, any lawful plane</td></tr><tr><th>Frequency:</th><td>Rare</td></tr><tr><th>Organization:</th><td>Brood</td></tr><tr><th>Activity Cycle:</th><td>Any</td></tr><tr><th>Diet:</th><td>Omnivore</td></tr><tr><th>Intelligence:</th><td>High (13-14)</td></tr><tr><th>Treasure:</th><td>E (individuals J,K,M,Q)</td></tr><tr><th>Alignment:</th><td>Lawful evil</td></tr><tr><th>No. Appearing:</th><td>3-18</td></tr><tr><th>Armor Class:</th><td>1 (0)</td></tr><tr><th>Movement:</th><td>9, Cl 3</td></tr><tr><th>Hit Dice:</th><td>7</td></tr><tr><th>THAC0:</th><td>13</td></tr><tr><th>No. of Attacks:</th><td>3 and 1</td></tr><tr><th>Damage/Attack:</th><td>1d4/1d4/1d8 and by weapon</td></tr><tr><th>Special Attacks:</th><td>Poison, magic use</td></tr><tr><th>Special Defenses:</th><td>Nil</td></tr><tr><th>Magic Resistance:</th><td>Nil</td></tr><tr><th>Size:</th><td>M (5½' tall)</td></tr><tr><th>Morale:</th><td>Unsteady (5-7)</td></tr><tr><th>XP Value:</th><td>3,000</td></tr></table><p class=\"f\">The tso are a race of slavers, smugglers, and cross-traders who roam the lawful planes - at least until they reach Arcadia or Mount Celestia, where they're not at all welcome. Tso are arrangers and procurers, eagerly pursuing the accumulation of wealth no matter what it takes. Despite their absolute lack of scruples and uncontrollable avarice, they're trustworthy in one regard: They never do anything unless they've got an ironclad contract for it.</p><p>Tso are related to <a href=\"/appendix/neogi\">neogi</a>, a race of similar appearance and tastes found on the Prime Material Plane. They're larger and stronger than their clueless cousins, standing about as tall as an adult human. The tso's body is spiderlike, with eight insectile limbs and a bulging abdomen. A long, serpentine neck rises from the creature's thorax, and its head is eellike with a mouth full of needle-sharp teeth. Unlike neogi, tso generally use only the rearmost pairs of legs for walking; the forward limbs are smaller, manipulative members. Tso are completely hairless, and their bodies are covered with gleaming chitin and leathery black skin at the joints or along their neck and head.</p><p>There aren't many tso, and as a race they're highly social. It's unheard of to meet a lone tso without others of its kind nearby. Tso're capable of magically enslaving other creatures to be their guards and agents, and a tso brood's normally accompanied by 2 to 3 times their number of slaves and bodyguards. All tso're at least marginally competent as mages, and it's rumored that an entire brood acting together can weave spells of dreadful power and sinister purpose.</p><p>A brood of tso travels in a bizarre vessel shaped like a monstrous spider; the individual design and characteristics of the vessel are different for each brood, but all tso vessels are capable of flight by means of a secret enchantment. A tso ship's commonly known as an aracheon, aracheas, or arachantine.</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Combat:</b> Tso're capable fighters, but they're also a cowardly race and go to great lengths to stay out of harm's way, letting their slaves fight for them. As noted above, a brood of tso can have anywhere from 2 to 3 times their own number of <i>charmed</i> slaves and guards. About 75% of these'll be planar or prime humans, <a href=\"/appendix/githzera\">githzerai</a>, and <a href=\"/appendix/tiefling\">tieflings</a> or <a href=\"/appendix/aasimar\">aasimar</a>. The remainder're rarer creatures such as lesser fiends or <a href=\"/appendix/modron\">modrons</a>, <a href=\"/appendix/khaasta\">khaasta</a>, or <a href=\"/appendix/reave\">reaves</a>. These sods'll fight to the death if so ordered by the tso, but it's more common for a typical tso to be careful of its property and try not to get its slaves killed needlessly. That's just good business sense.</p><p>When a tso's desperate or backed into a corner, it can fight surprisingly well. It strikes with its two uppermost claws for 1d4 points of damage each, a vicious bite for 1d8 points of damage, and uses its second pair of limbs to wield either a two-handed weapon (a polearm or staff) or a one-handed weapon and shield, improving its AC to 0. The tso's bite is poisonous; anyone bitten by the creature must make a successful save versus poison or suffer 1d10 points of extra damage and be <i>paralyzed</i> for 1d4 turns.</p><p>Tso've got a powerful magical ability to <i>enslave</i> other creatures. This functions like an extremely powerful <i>charm</i>. The tso must be able to touch its victim and can make no other attack that round. The victim must make a successful saving throw versus spell at -2 or fall under the tso's thrall, serving willingly and without reservation. The victim's Intelligence score is considered to be halved for purposes of determining the time period between saving throws to escape the <i>charm</i>.</p><p>In addition to their <i>enslavement</i> ability, all tso are mages of levels 2 to 5 (d4+1), with appropriate spell capabilities. They favor nondestructive spells that provide information, deception, or the ability to capture an opponent. Tso perceive <i>phantasmal force</i> or <i>detect invisibility</i> to be far more useful than <i>burning hands</i> or <i>Melf's acid arrow</i>.</p><p>A group of tso can cast cooperative magic at the base level of the most skillful tso present, plus one for each additional tso - a 5th-level tso mage with 6 lesser tso aiding it casts spells as an 11th-level wizard. The leading tso can choose any spell available to its new level, regardless of whether or not it had memorized the spell to be cast, but the casting time increases tenfold; a spell with a casting time of 7 requires 7 rounds of cooperative spellcasting. Cooperative magic is a property of the tso approach to magic, which is alien and undecipherable to nontso wizards. The spell that empowers the aracheons with the ability to navigate the skies is jealously guarded and must be cast by a brood of at least 13 tso.</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Habitat/Society:</b> Tso are social creatures that don't like to be separated from others of their kind. Their social lives revolve around the rest of their brood and the conduct of business from the brood ship. From time to time, business arrangements might require a smaller group of tso to remain bebind, but it's almost inconceivable that fewer than three tso would be sent on such a mission. When a tso does have to leave the ship, it brings its personal servants along with it.</p><p>The second driving force behind the tso is pure avarice. A tso's greed is legendary. The tso constantly seek out ways to make money, either through service rendered or the acquisition of highly-desired goods. For example, a tso brood might learn that a Lord of the Nine in Baator's taken a fancy to gems of a certain type. They'll draw up a contract with the <a href=\"/appendix/baatezu\">baatezu</a> lord to seek out and bring back the objects in question, and then travel to where they can get what's called for. On the other end of the deal, the tso'll use any means necessary to get what they've promised to provide. (It's more profitable when a body doesn't pay to get the inventory he means to sell, after all.)</p><p>Tso broods'll take contracts on almost anything. They'll carry slaves, contraband, or even legitimate trade from time to time. They'll accept contracts for kidnaping, assassinations, or arson. If there's a profit in it somewhere, the tso're interested. A brood of tso's extremely devious and clever in the wordings of its contracts and bury all kinds of clauses and subcontracts in the body of the main draft. Tso figure if a sod don't read what he signs, he deserves to get peeled. Negotiations between tso and baatezu are something to see.</p><p>The brood ship's led by the oldest and most powerful tso. Usually, this's the most accomplished sorcerer of the brood, but it can also be the tso with the most powerful slave. Tso measure their station in the brood very carefully, factoring in personal wealth, power, and the number and quality of slaves each tso controls. Tso organization's simple: If a blood with a higher standing says jump, the lower ranks jump.</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Ecology:</b> Tso reproduce by selecting one of their older brood-members to become the parent of a new brood. This doesn't happen at any fixed interval - it just depends on when a tso reaches a suitable age. When this happens, the other members of the brood paralyze the parent-to-be, beginning a series of radical body changes. The brooding tso is immobilized, but eats constantly for 8 to 10 weeks before 3 to 5 young emerge from its body, killing the parent.</p><p>Unlike a neogi brood, the young tso emerge as sentient but smaller versions of their parent. There's a strong tie between siblings, and they're likely to spend their entire lives together. The older tso around the young raise them, and in less than a year the young're incorporated into the tso hierarchy as the low sods on the totem pole.</p><p>From time to time, a group of tso becomes too large for its aracheon. Trading parties'll be permanently dispatched from the ship to alleviate the problem for a while, but eventually the brood must split and a new ship'll have to be built. This is a dangerous and unpredictable time for the tso, and months of scheming, plots, and deals revolve around deciding which tso will remain with the original group and which'll strike off on their own.</p>\n","images":["<img src=\"grf/ps.gif\" width=\"150\" height=\"75\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Planescape\" title=\"Planescape\" align=\"right\">","<img src=\"img/tso.gif\" alt=\"Tso\" title=\"Tso\" border=\"0\" width=\"300\" height=\"360\" style=\"text-align:right;\" align=\"right\">","<img src=\"grf/add2_01.gif\" width=\"200\" height=\"56\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Advanced Dungeons & Dragons 2nd Edition\">"],"setting":"Planescape","statblock":{"Tso":{"Activity Cycle":"Any","Alignment":"Lawful evil","Armor Class":"1 (0)","Climate/Terrain":"Outlands, any lawful plane","Damage/Attack":"1d4/1d4/1d8 and by weapon","Diet":"Omnivore","Frequency":"Rare","Hit Dice":"7","Intelligence":"High (13-14)","Magic Resistance":"Nil","Morale":"Unsteady (5-7)","Movement":"9, Cl 3","No. Appearing":"3-18","No. of Attacks":"3 and 1","Organization":"Brood","Size":"M (5½' tall)","Special Attacks":"Poison, magic use","Special Defenses":"Nil","THAC0":"13","Treasure":"E (individuals J,K,M,Q)","XP Value":"3,000"}},"title":"Tso"},"sources":["2613"],"statblock_names":[],"title":"Tso","prev_key":"tsnng","next_key":"tualleia","monster_path":"/appendix/tso"}},"staticQueryHashes":[],"slicesMap":{}}
