While the powers listed above are the most common, some aarakocra have different or additional powers.</p><p class=\"f\">A race of intelligent, birdlike creatures living in the deepest deserts of Athas, the rare Athasian <a href=\"/appendix/aarakocr\">aarakocra</a> spends its time soaring on thermals in search of food.</p><p>The aarakocra is 7 to 8 feet tall with a wingspan of 20 feet or more. Because of its large wingspan, an aarakocra can carry as much as 75% of its own body weight and still fly easily. An aarakocra can fly a short distance carrying a burden equaling 125% of its own body weight. The average body weight of a full grown male is 100 pounds and a female is 85 pounds.</p><p>Each wing has a &ldquo;hand&rdquo; at its midpoint, consisting of three fingers and an opposable thumb. The fourth finger forms the rigid leading edge of the wing. In flight the hands cannot be used, but on the ground the aarakocra can use its hands almost as a human would. The aarakocra's body is protected by a thin bony plate on the chest, much like a solid rib cage. Talons on its legs can be used as claws and can be retracted to reveal a second set of hands, also with three fingers and an opposable thumb. Except for the chest plate, the entire skeleton is hollow and extremely fragile.</p><p>From a distance, the Athasian aarakocra resembles a huge <a href=\"/appendix/bird\">vulture</a>. Its black eyes, set in the front of the head, provide excellent vision over a long range. The plumage is generally black with a white collar for adult males and black or brown with a smaller white collar for females. Adolescents are a mixture of brown and black. The beak is large and covers most of the head. Plumage begins at the crown of the head and is darker near the head, except for the collar. Athasian aarakocra speak their own language and the languages of vultures and other large birds. Some speak the common tongue (5% to 10% chance depending on how deep in the wastelands a tribe lives).</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Combat:</b> Aarakocra can fight in the air or on the ground. They prefer aerial combat since their bones are too fragile to withstand a solid blow from a human-sized opponent. In combat against creatures on the ground, they prefer to fly over their victim and drop weighted nets. Some aarakocra use darts to harass ground-based opponents.</p><p>If their opponents can fly, the aarakocra generally forgo the use of the net, although large groups sometimes use nets on flying creatures. Normally, aarakocra attack flying creatures with long spears, diving from above and allowing the momentum to carry the spear through the target. Such an attack doubles the damage if the aarakocra have been able to dive at least 50 feet. Only the very largest aarakocra can carry more than one of these spears, they can attack with both at once with no penalty, causing double damage on each strike. All diving attacks are made at +4 and should be treated as a charge attack. All other penalties and restrictions of charge attacks apply.</p><p>The effect of the aarakocra's nets depends on if the opponent is flying at the time it becomes entangled. Creatures on the ground that are hit by a net are entangled and unable to participate in any combat until they make a successful Strength check to get free of the net. Flying creatures hit by a net can no longer fly and immediately begin falling. If they cannot escape the net or use some magical means to arrest the fall, normal falling damage applies.</p><p>Unless victims are entangled in nets, aarakocra are cautious in ground combat. If the aarakocra outnumber their opponents they advance in a straight line and thrust with their spears. If outnumbered, or the opponents are particularly tough, the aarakocra withdraw. Victims entangled in nets are killed or incapacitated for use as food or ransom.</p><p>Athasian aarakocra are mindful of their physical limitations as well as their comparatively low psionic abilities. They do not normally initiate psionic combat. At the first sign of psionic powers from any of their victims, however, all aarakocra that have some ability will use whatever attack and defense modes they can in an attempt to destroy the threat. Large groups of is or more aarakocra may initiate psionic combat if their leaders feel they can win quickly and avoid physical combat.</p><p>In desperation, an aarakocra can attempt to bite an opponent in combat. Because of the unwieldiness of its beak, the aarakocra has a THAC0 of 18 if attacking with this appendage. Further, the birdman causes only 1d2 points of damage with the beak.</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Habitat/Society:</b> Athasian aarakocra live in tribes with 6-20 (2d8+4) members, depending on the prestige of the leader. The largest tribe ever recorded had 50 members. The tribal hunting territory depends on the size of the tribe, usually about 500 square miles for a tribe of 10 members. There are no rigid boundaries between tribes and border disputes are not uncommon.</p><p>Alignments of tribe members are similar to the alignment of the leader. A tribe that has a leader who is neutral good may have neutral good, chaotic good, lawful good, and true neutral members. A predominantly evil tribe does not recognize boundaries with other tribes and treats other tribes as inferior beings to be eliminated.</p><p>Athasian aarakocra aren't happy in enclosed spaces, but they they take refuge in a cave or building if necessary.</p><p>Nonevil tribes live in rocky aeries in the highest peaks they can find. Evil tribes are normally nomadic and use an aerie made by another tribe if they need to remain in an area for a long time, even if they have to evict the tribe that made the nest.</p><p>Aarakocra aren't friendly toward intruders in their territory, especially caravans. They try to extract a toll from the caravan for passage through the desert. Good-aligned tribes allow unhindered passage of caravans that pay a tribute. If someone refuses to pay the tribute, the aarakocra try to capture scouts or outriders from the party and hold them until an even larger tribute is paid. The payment may be either livestock or shiny objects. Aarakocra are smart enough not to be taken in by glass baubles instead of gems, although they cannot tell the difference between the more common gems and the rare ones.</p><p>Evil tribes ask for tribute and often attack a caravan whether it pays or not. Aarakocra always demand shiny objects such as stones. These tribes find humans and demihumans to be quite tasty and prefer them to other food.</p><p>Good-aligned tribes of aarakocra sometimes return a lost traveler to the edge of the desert after first removing any valuables the traveler may be carrying. On very rare occasions a tribe might return a lost group of travelers to the more frequently traveled parts of the desert, again after first taking any valuables as payment.</p><p>The oldest male is the leader of the tribal hunting party and has 4+4 Hit Dice. The oldest female is in charge of the tribal aerie and has 3+3 HD. In tribes that have more than 15 members, the next oldest aarakocra serves as shaman and has 3+3 HD; the shaman completes the triumvirate necessary for proper worship and the summoning of elementals. (Interestingly, no magic-using aarakocra has ever been recorded.) Tribes without a shaman cannot summon <a href=\"/appendix/element1\">air elementals</a>, which is an important part of aarakocra culture.</p><p>The shaman is the leader of the daily sun worship. Aarakocra worship the sun because it provides them with the thermals they need to soar in search of food. The shaman also leads the mystic rituals used to summon an air elemental. Summoning an air elemental is usually done only in preparation for the tribe's most sacred ceremony, the hunt. Small tribes must band together for this ceremony to allow the triumvirate to be formed.</p><p>The ceremony to summon an air elemental must be conducted at dawn and requires the oldest male and female to emit a highpitched keening whistle. The shaman conducts an intricate dance around them, simultaneously chanting an ancient summoning mantra.</p><p>The hunt is the final part of the initiation of adolescent aarakocra to adulthood and often takes the tribe far from their normal teritory. The target is always a <a href=\"/appendix/drakalsi\">silt drake</a>. The hunt is the only time the females leave the relative safety of the nest. Even an evil tribe will not interfere with a tribe on a hunt. An air elemental is often summoned to help find the drake, but never takes part in the actual combat. Although the adult members of the tribe take part in the initial phases of the combat, it is the initiates who deliver the final, killing blows to me drake. Scars from the hunt are considered a mark of pride among all aarakocra.</p><p>The females spend about eight months of the year incubating their eggs. Athasian aarakocra mate for life and a pair normally produces as many as 10 offspring. A female lays one egg a year. Constant incubation is not required because of the high daytime temperatures, so the females can maintain the nest and keep the tribe's treasure in order.</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Ecology:</b> Athasian aarakocra are high on the food chain and have no natural enemies other than <a href=\"/appendix/drakatha\">drakes</a>. Unless evil, aarakocra leave their own territory only to hunt the silt drake and return as soon as possible when the hunt is over. (Evil aarakocra attack others, as noted above.) Aarakocra eggs and hatchlings are sought after by wealthy land owners who wish to use the creatures as scouts and sentries. An egg can bring as much as 10 cp in Tyr's marketplace. Tribes that have had eggs or hatchlings stolen have long memories and sometimes take revenge against the thief at a later date. Captive aarakocra join any tribe they come in contact with.</p><p>Athasian aarakocra have a natural life span of 21-30 years.</p>\n","images":["<img src=\"grf/ds.gif\" width=\"150\" height=\"75\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Dark Sun\" title=\"Dark Sun\" align=\"right\">","<img src=\"img/aarakath.gif\" alt=\"Aarakocra (Athas)\" title=\"Aarakocra (Athas)\" border=\"0\" width=\"300\" height=\"360\" style=\"text-align:right;\" align=\"right\">","<img src=\"grf/add2_01.gif\" width=\"200\" height=\"56\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Advanced Dungeons & Dragons 2nd Edition\">"],"setting":"Dark Sun","statblock":{"Aarakocra (Athas)":{"Activity Cycle":"Day","Alignment":"Any","Armor Class":"7","Climate/Terrain":"Deep desert","Damage/Attack":"1d3/1d3 or by weapon","Diet":"Carnivore","Frequency":"Rare","Hit Dice":"2+2","Intelligence":"Average (8-10)","Magic Resistance":"Nil","Morale":"Steady (11)","Movement":"6, Fl 36 (C)","No. Appearing":"1d10","No. of Attacks":"2","Organization":"Tribal","Size":"M (20'+ wingspan)","Special Attacks":"Nil","Special Defenses":"Nil","THAC0":"17","Treasure":"Varies","XP Value":"65"}},"title":"Aarakocra (Athas)"},"sources":["2433"],"statblock_names":[],"title":"Aarakocra (Athas)","prev_key":"zygraat","next_key":"aarakocr","monster_path":"/appendix/aarakath"}}},"pageContext":{"monster_key":"asuras","monster_data":{"TSR":["2129","2615"],"fullBody":"  <table cellspacing=\"0\" cellpadding=\"0\"><tr><th>Climate/Terrain:</th><td>Any/Upper Planes</td></tr><tr><th>Frequency:</th><td>Very rare (Rare on Upper Planes)</td></tr><tr><th>Organization:</th><td>Hierarchy</td></tr><tr><th>Activity Cycle:</th><td>Unsleeping</td></tr><tr><th>Diet:</th><td>Positive energy</td></tr><tr><th>Intelligence:</th><td>Genius (17-18)</td></tr><tr><th>Treasure:</th><td>Nil</td></tr><tr><th>Alignment:</th><td>Chaotic good</td></tr><tr><th>No. Appearing:</th><td>1 (2d20 on Upper Planes)</td></tr><tr><th>Armor Class:</th><td>-2</td></tr><tr><th>Movement:</th><td>12, Fl 33 (A)</td></tr><tr><th>Hit Dice:</th><td>8</td></tr><tr><th>THAC0:</th><td>13</td></tr><tr><th>No. of Attacks:</th><td>3</td></tr><tr><th>Damage/Attack:</th><td>1-10/1-10/by weapon type</td></tr><tr><th>Special Attacks:</th><td>Fiery eyes, trumpet blare, burning winds, spells</td></tr><tr><th>Special Defenses:</th><td>Spell immunities</td></tr><tr><th>Magic Resistance:</th><td>40%</td></tr><tr><th>Size:</th><td>M (6')</td></tr><tr><th>Morale:</th><td>Fearless (19)</td></tr><tr><th>XP Value:</th><td>7,000</td></tr></table><p class=\"f\">Asuras are found throughout the Upper Planes, serving various powers as messengers and heralds with a righteous zealotry. They may serve as the voices of knowledge, sharing wisdom that guides mortal oracles and mystics. More often, however, the asuras carry messages of revenge, punishment, and death, sent to those who have angered one of the powers.</p><p>Noble warriors, asuras have birdlike talons for feet and wings of brightly burning flame. Marble-white flesh of pleasing countenance covers their stately frame, and their eyes are piercing orbs of the purest fire. Males and females alike wear loose togas of sky blue or snow white. A long mane of red, gold, or copper locks crowns their pale heads. Male asuras adorn their heads in feather-crested helms of bronze. The unjust understandably find asuras terrifying to behold.</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Combat:</b> The claws of the asuras have been likened to rubies both for their color and their consistency. Very sharp and very hard, the talons tear into the flesh of the wicked with terrible force, dealing 1d10 points of damage each blow. Because of the potency of its claws, an asuras prefers to attack from the air, swooping and hovering above foes. Additionally, this righteous avenger can carry a scimitar or huge spear. Weapon attacks can be directed at a second enemy or at the victim being clawed. There is a 25% chance that an asuras carries a magical flaming weapon similar to a flame tongue sword.</p><p>Large groups of asuras blow mighty trumpets while entering battle, the sound of which chills a dark soul to its core. Evil beings of 3 Hit Dice or less must make a morale check upon hearing these horns, even if not yet engaged in conflict. The horns can be heard for miles.</p><p>Moreover, three or more asuras can create a burning wind with their wings. This mode of attack inflicts 2d10 hit points of damage upon evil beings, while not harming good or neutral creatures at all.</p><p>The renowned intuition of the asuras is spoken of throughout the planes. Asuras have a Wisdom score of 21, giving them an immunity to <i>charm</i>, <i>command</i>, <i>fear</i>, <i>forget</i>, <i>friends</i>, <i>hold person</i>, <i>hypnotism</i>, <i>ray of enfeeblement</i> and <i>scare</i> spells. They also can see the truth behind all illusions. The golden fires of their eyes dim in the presence of untrue words as a <i>detect lie</i> spell, and three times each day they can see through all deceptive or concealing veils, as the spell <i>true seeing</i>. All asuras cast priest spells as 9th-level casters, with full benefits gained from their remarkable Wisdom scores. Lastly, these beings can <i>polymorph self</i> twice per day into the form of a human or demihuman in order to blend in with normal societies. Their forms are always extremely pleasing, and they remain capable fighters and spellcasters no matter what their outward appearance.</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Habitat/Society:</b> The asuras are organized into hosts, although there is little more structure to their ranks than that. Nevertheless, the host operates well together and gladly obeys the commands of its superiors. All asuras are free to leave their current host and join another at any time. Their service is always freely offered and gladly accepted by the host leader. These leaders have double the normal number of Hit Dice and maximum hit points. They are also blessed with a Wisdom score or 22, along with the corresponding spell immunities. Standing before the host that they command, asuras leaders are visibly different from their subordinates. Taller and more noble in appearance, they have a visible aura of golden light circling their forms.</p><p>The general of the Grand Celestial Host is an asuras named Absalom. This radiant individual outshines all others of his kind, leading his holy army of thousands like a handsome, luminous beacon of righteous power. Despite his might and appearance, Absalom is not a power and does not aspire to such high office.</p><p>Asuras dislike <a href=\"/appendix/aasideva\">devas</a> and other <a href=\"/appendix/aasimon\">aasimon</a> (especially lawful ones), seeing them as rivals for the attention of the good powers. Unlike their lower-planar counterparts, however, aasimon and asuras rarely allow their rivalry to degenerate to blows. Likewise, due to the nature of both types of beings, neither resorts to any sort of double-dealing or underhanded measures. Instead, their feelings for each other are openly contemptuous.</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Ecology:</b> The asuras feed upon energies from the Positive Energy Plane. Gaining their sustenance from this otherworldly source, they have no base requirements such as food, air, or even sleep.</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Rogue Asuras</b></p>  <p class=\"ni\">As a creature born of a chaotic nature, sometimes an asuras <q>falls through the cracks</q>. For whatever reason, such an asuras may end up without a power to serve. These rare individuals roam the planes, committing random acts of charity and good will. They defend the downtrodden, rescue the oppressed, and provide for the needy. These rogues often become so narrowly focused in their deeds that they do anything to meet the desired end - sometimes getting carried away in violence and their use of power.</p><p>In the words of the planar merchant Gillias Fornmith:</p><p><q>Asuras without a host wander about the planes, giving a good turn wherever they go. But here's the real dark of it: When they travel alone they go a little barmy. You meet one, get greeted politely, and the next thing you know he'll take your head off to save a rabbit you've trapped for your dinner, or steal your whole haul to give to some poor street waif. You might say they lose a bit of perspective on the whole good/evil thing. Lucky for a sod like me, a clever tongue can talk them out of their cockeyed notions. You can use the good sense within the creatures to show them their own folly.</q></p><p>Occasionally, a rogue asuras succumbs to the charms of a particularly pious or righteous human. If such a union occurs, the offspring is usually a fair-skinned human with bright, piercing eyes. A few are able to detect lie in the same manner as their asuras progenitor. All asuras offspring are likely to become mystics, holy figures, or powerful warriors - always significant figures for the force of goodness. These offspring closely resemble the <a href=\"/appendix/aasimar\">aasimar</a>, having similar origins.</p>\n","images":["<img src=\"grf/aq.gif\" width=\"150\" height=\"75\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Al-Qadim (Forgotten Realms)\" title=\"Al-Qadim (Forgotten Realms)\" align=\"right\">","<img src=\"img/asuras.gif\" alt=\"Asuras\" title=\"Asuras\" border=\"0\" width=\"300\" height=\"360\" style=\"text-align:right;\" align=\"right\">","<img src=\"grf/add2_01.gif\" width=\"200\" height=\"56\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Advanced Dungeons & Dragons 2nd Edition\">"],"setting":"Al-Qadim (Forgotten Realms)","statblock":{"Asuras":{"Activity Cycle":"Unsleeping","Alignment":"Chaotic good","Armor Class":"-2","Climate/Terrain":"Any/Upper Planes","Damage/Attack":"1-10/1-10/by weapon type","Diet":"Positive energy","Frequency":"Very rare (Rare on Upper Planes)","Hit Dice":"8","Intelligence":"Genius (17-18)","Magic Resistance":"40%","Morale":"Fearless (19)","Movement":"12, Fl 33 (A)","No. Appearing":"1 (2d20 on Upper Planes)","No. of Attacks":"3","Organization":"Hierarchy","Size":"M (6')","Special Attacks":"Fiery eyes, trumpet blare, burning winds, spells","Special Defenses":"Spell immunities","THAC0":"13","Treasure":"Nil","XP Value":"7,000"}},"title":"Asuras"},"sources":["2129","2615"],"statblock_names":[],"title":"Asuras","prev_key":"astrwolf","next_key":"audreean","monster_path":"/appendix/asuras"}},"staticQueryHashes":[],"slicesMap":{}}
