While the powers listed above are the most common, some aarakocra have different or additional powers.</p><p class=\"f\">A race of intelligent, birdlike creatures living in the deepest deserts of Athas, the rare Athasian <a href=\"/appendix/aarakocr\">aarakocra</a> spends its time soaring on thermals in search of food.</p><p>The aarakocra is 7 to 8 feet tall with a wingspan of 20 feet or more. Because of its large wingspan, an aarakocra can carry as much as 75% of its own body weight and still fly easily. An aarakocra can fly a short distance carrying a burden equaling 125% of its own body weight. The average body weight of a full grown male is 100 pounds and a female is 85 pounds.</p><p>Each wing has a &ldquo;hand&rdquo; at its midpoint, consisting of three fingers and an opposable thumb. The fourth finger forms the rigid leading edge of the wing. In flight the hands cannot be used, but on the ground the aarakocra can use its hands almost as a human would. The aarakocra's body is protected by a thin bony plate on the chest, much like a solid rib cage. Talons on its legs can be used as claws and can be retracted to reveal a second set of hands, also with three fingers and an opposable thumb. Except for the chest plate, the entire skeleton is hollow and extremely fragile.</p><p>From a distance, the Athasian aarakocra resembles a huge <a href=\"/appendix/bird\">vulture</a>. Its black eyes, set in the front of the head, provide excellent vision over a long range. The plumage is generally black with a white collar for adult males and black or brown with a smaller white collar for females. Adolescents are a mixture of brown and black. The beak is large and covers most of the head. Plumage begins at the crown of the head and is darker near the head, except for the collar. Athasian aarakocra speak their own language and the languages of vultures and other large birds. Some speak the common tongue (5% to 10% chance depending on how deep in the wastelands a tribe lives).</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Combat:</b> Aarakocra can fight in the air or on the ground. They prefer aerial combat since their bones are too fragile to withstand a solid blow from a human-sized opponent. In combat against creatures on the ground, they prefer to fly over their victim and drop weighted nets. Some aarakocra use darts to harass ground-based opponents.</p><p>If their opponents can fly, the aarakocra generally forgo the use of the net, although large groups sometimes use nets on flying creatures. Normally, aarakocra attack flying creatures with long spears, diving from above and allowing the momentum to carry the spear through the target. Such an attack doubles the damage if the aarakocra have been able to dive at least 50 feet. Only the very largest aarakocra can carry more than one of these spears, they can attack with both at once with no penalty, causing double damage on each strike. All diving attacks are made at +4 and should be treated as a charge attack. All other penalties and restrictions of charge attacks apply.</p><p>The effect of the aarakocra's nets depends on if the opponent is flying at the time it becomes entangled. Creatures on the ground that are hit by a net are entangled and unable to participate in any combat until they make a successful Strength check to get free of the net. Flying creatures hit by a net can no longer fly and immediately begin falling. If they cannot escape the net or use some magical means to arrest the fall, normal falling damage applies.</p><p>Unless victims are entangled in nets, aarakocra are cautious in ground combat. If the aarakocra outnumber their opponents they advance in a straight line and thrust with their spears. If outnumbered, or the opponents are particularly tough, the aarakocra withdraw. Victims entangled in nets are killed or incapacitated for use as food or ransom.</p><p>Athasian aarakocra are mindful of their physical limitations as well as their comparatively low psionic abilities. They do not normally initiate psionic combat. At the first sign of psionic powers from any of their victims, however, all aarakocra that have some ability will use whatever attack and defense modes they can in an attempt to destroy the threat. Large groups of is or more aarakocra may initiate psionic combat if their leaders feel they can win quickly and avoid physical combat.</p><p>In desperation, an aarakocra can attempt to bite an opponent in combat. Because of the unwieldiness of its beak, the aarakocra has a THAC0 of 18 if attacking with this appendage. Further, the birdman causes only 1d2 points of damage with the beak.</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Habitat/Society:</b> Athasian aarakocra live in tribes with 6-20 (2d8+4) members, depending on the prestige of the leader. The largest tribe ever recorded had 50 members. The tribal hunting territory depends on the size of the tribe, usually about 500 square miles for a tribe of 10 members. There are no rigid boundaries between tribes and border disputes are not uncommon.</p><p>Alignments of tribe members are similar to the alignment of the leader. A tribe that has a leader who is neutral good may have neutral good, chaotic good, lawful good, and true neutral members. A predominantly evil tribe does not recognize boundaries with other tribes and treats other tribes as inferior beings to be eliminated.</p><p>Athasian aarakocra aren't happy in enclosed spaces, but they they take refuge in a cave or building if necessary.</p><p>Nonevil tribes live in rocky aeries in the highest peaks they can find. Evil tribes are normally nomadic and use an aerie made by another tribe if they need to remain in an area for a long time, even if they have to evict the tribe that made the nest.</p><p>Aarakocra aren't friendly toward intruders in their territory, especially caravans. They try to extract a toll from the caravan for passage through the desert. Good-aligned tribes allow unhindered passage of caravans that pay a tribute. If someone refuses to pay the tribute, the aarakocra try to capture scouts or outriders from the party and hold them until an even larger tribute is paid. The payment may be either livestock or shiny objects. Aarakocra are smart enough not to be taken in by glass baubles instead of gems, although they cannot tell the difference between the more common gems and the rare ones.</p><p>Evil tribes ask for tribute and often attack a caravan whether it pays or not. Aarakocra always demand shiny objects such as stones. These tribes find humans and demihumans to be quite tasty and prefer them to other food.</p><p>Good-aligned tribes of aarakocra sometimes return a lost traveler to the edge of the desert after first removing any valuables the traveler may be carrying. On very rare occasions a tribe might return a lost group of travelers to the more frequently traveled parts of the desert, again after first taking any valuables as payment.</p><p>The oldest male is the leader of the tribal hunting party and has 4+4 Hit Dice. The oldest female is in charge of the tribal aerie and has 3+3 HD. In tribes that have more than 15 members, the next oldest aarakocra serves as shaman and has 3+3 HD; the shaman completes the triumvirate necessary for proper worship and the summoning of elementals. (Interestingly, no magic-using aarakocra has ever been recorded.) Tribes without a shaman cannot summon <a href=\"/appendix/element1\">air elementals</a>, which is an important part of aarakocra culture.</p><p>The shaman is the leader of the daily sun worship. Aarakocra worship the sun because it provides them with the thermals they need to soar in search of food. The shaman also leads the mystic rituals used to summon an air elemental. Summoning an air elemental is usually done only in preparation for the tribe's most sacred ceremony, the hunt. Small tribes must band together for this ceremony to allow the triumvirate to be formed.</p><p>The ceremony to summon an air elemental must be conducted at dawn and requires the oldest male and female to emit a highpitched keening whistle. The shaman conducts an intricate dance around them, simultaneously chanting an ancient summoning mantra.</p><p>The hunt is the final part of the initiation of adolescent aarakocra to adulthood and often takes the tribe far from their normal teritory. The target is always a <a href=\"/appendix/drakalsi\">silt drake</a>. The hunt is the only time the females leave the relative safety of the nest. Even an evil tribe will not interfere with a tribe on a hunt. An air elemental is often summoned to help find the drake, but never takes part in the actual combat. Although the adult members of the tribe take part in the initial phases of the combat, it is the initiates who deliver the final, killing blows to me drake. Scars from the hunt are considered a mark of pride among all aarakocra.</p><p>The females spend about eight months of the year incubating their eggs. Athasian aarakocra mate for life and a pair normally produces as many as 10 offspring. A female lays one egg a year. Constant incubation is not required because of the high daytime temperatures, so the females can maintain the nest and keep the tribe's treasure in order.</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Ecology:</b> Athasian aarakocra are high on the food chain and have no natural enemies other than <a href=\"/appendix/drakatha\">drakes</a>. Unless evil, aarakocra leave their own territory only to hunt the silt drake and return as soon as possible when the hunt is over. (Evil aarakocra attack others, as noted above.) Aarakocra eggs and hatchlings are sought after by wealthy land owners who wish to use the creatures as scouts and sentries. An egg can bring as much as 10 cp in Tyr's marketplace. Tribes that have had eggs or hatchlings stolen have long memories and sometimes take revenge against the thief at a later date. Captive aarakocra join any tribe they come in contact with.</p><p>Athasian aarakocra have a natural life span of 21-30 years.</p><br clear=\"all\" style=\"clear:both; height:0;\">\r\n","images":["<img src=\"grf/ds.gif\" width=\"150\" height=\"75\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Dark Sun\" title=\"Dark Sun\" align=\"right\">","<img src=\"img/aarakath.gif\" alt=\"Aarakocra (Athas)\" title=\"Aarakocra (Athas)\" border=\"0\" width=\"300\" height=\"360\" style=\"text-align:right;\" align=\"right\">","<img src=\"grf/add2_01.gif\" width=\"200\" height=\"56\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Advanced Dungeons & Dragons 2nd Edition\">"],"setting":"Dark Sun","statblock":{"Aarakocra (Athas)":{"Activity Cycle":"Day","Alignment":"Any","Armor Class":"7","Climate/Terrain":"Deep desert","Damage/Attack":"1d3/1d3 or by weapon","Diet":"Carnivore","Frequency":"Rare","Hit Dice":"2+2","Intelligence":"Average (8-10)","Magic Resistance":"Nil","Morale":"Steady (11)","Movement":"6, Fl 36 (C)","No. Appearing":"1d10","No. of Attacks":"2","Organization":"Tribal","Size":"M (20'+ wingspan)","Special Attacks":"Nil","Special Defenses":"Nil","THAC0":"17","Treasure":"Varies","XP Value":"65"}},"title":"Aarakocra (Athas)"},"sources":["2433"],"statblock_names":[],"title":"Aarakocra (Athas)","prev_key":"zygraat","next_key":"aarakocr","monster_path":"/appendix/aarakath"}}},"pageContext":{"monster_key":"livitatt","monster_data":{"TSR":["2153"],"fullBody":"  <table cellspacing=\"0\" cellpadding=\"0\"><tr class=\"bk\"><th> </th><th class=\"cn\">Dark Man</th><th class=\"cn\">Living Spear</th><th class=\"cn\">Panther</th><th class=\"cn\">Raven</th><th class=\"cn\">Winged Snake</th></tr><tr><th>Climate/Terrain:</th><td>Nightmare Lands</td><td>Nightmare Lands</td><td>Nightmare Lands</td><td>Nightmare Lands</td><td>Nightmare Lands</td></tr><tr><th>Frequency:</th><td>Very rare</td><td>Rare</td><td>Rare</td><td>Rare</td><td>Very Rare</td></tr><tr><th>Organization:</th><td>Bonded</td><td>Bonded</td><td>Bonded</td><td>Bonded</td><td>Bonded</td></tr><tr><th>Activity Cycle:</th><td>Any</td><td>Any</td><td>Any</td><td>Any</td><td>Any</td></tr><tr><th>Diet:</th><td>Nil</td><td>Nil</td><td>Nil</td><td>Nil</td><td>Nil</td></tr><tr><th>Intelligence:</th><td>Low (5-7)</td><td>Animal (1)</td><td>Semi- (2-4)</td><td>Very (11-12)</td><td>Average (8-10)</td></tr><tr><th>Treasure:</th><td>Nil</td><td>Nil</td><td>Nil</td><td>Nil</td><td>Feathers</td></tr><tr><th>Alignment:</th><td>Chaotic neutral</td><td>Neutral</td><td>Neutral</td><td>Neutral good</td><td>Neutral</td></tr><tr><th>No. Appearing:</th><td>1</td><td>1-2</td><td>1</td><td>1</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><th>Armor Class:</th><td>7</td><td>1</td><td>6</td><td>6</td><td>5</td></tr><tr><th>Movement:</th><td>12</td><td>Nil</td><td>15</td><td>1, Fl 36 (B)</td><td>12, Fl 18 (B)</td></tr><tr><th>Hit Dice:</th><td>3+3</td><td>2+2</td><td>3+2</td><td>2+2</td><td>4+4</td></tr><tr><th>THAC0:</th><td>17</td><td>19</td><td>17</td><td>19</td><td>17</td></tr><tr><th>No. of Attacks:</th><td>1</td><td>1</td><td>3</td><td>1</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><th>Damage/Attack:</th><td>2-5</td><td>2-7 (1d6+1)</td><td>1-3/1-3/1-8</td><td>3-6 (1d4+2)</td><td>1-4</td></tr><tr><th>Special Attacks:</th><td>Strength drain</td><td>Poison</td><td>Surprise, rear claw rake</td><td><i>Detect lie</i></td><td>Poison, spark shower</td></tr><tr><th>Special Defenses:</th><td>+1 or better;<br>spell immunity</td><td>+1 or better;<br>spell immunity</td><td>+1 or better,<br>surprised on 1</td><td>+1 or better,<br>resist illusions</td><td>+1 or better,<br>resist electricity</td></tr><tr><th>Magic Resistance:</th><td>Nil</td><td>Nil</td><td>Nil</td><td>Nil</td><td>Nil</td></tr><tr><th>Size:</th><td>M (6')</td><td>M (4-5')</td><td>M (5-6')</td><td>S (3')</td><td>M (4-5')</td></tr><tr><th>Morale:</th><td>Steady (11-12)</td><td>Steady (11-12)</td><td>Steady (11-12)</td><td>Elite (13-14)</td><td>Elite (13-14)</td></tr><tr><th>XP Value:</th><td>420</td><td>420</td><td>270</td><td>420</td><td>975</td></tr></table><p class=\"f\">One of the most worthy and stalwart companions found in the Land of the Mists, a living tattoo is actually a spirit convinced to leave the swirling chaos of the Nightmare Lands for a more stable existence in the mystically prepared shelter of a magical tattoo. Only the <a href=\"/appendix/humaabno\">Abber nomads</a> have mastered the process by which these spirits are lured and captured.</p><p>Living tattoos come in many varieties, but the powers of the creature and the role that it is to play in its owner's life are always reflected in the shape of the tattoo. For example, a hunter who desires a tattoo that will help him track prey might have one fashioned in the image of a <a href=\"/appendix/wolf\">wolf</a> or keen-sighted <a href=\"/appendix/eagle\">eagle</a>.</p><p>Even while separated, both the bearer and the tattoo are instantly aware of each other's thoughts and feelings and can act almost as one in battle. If either bearer or tattoo is wounded, the other feels the pain as well. The tattoo is able to communicate in whatever way a natural creature of its type would and also has mastery of the languages that its bearer speaks.</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Combat:</b> A living tattoo will always work with its bearer. aiding the character to the best of its ability and even fighting to the death if necessary. Because the tattoo is a free-willed creature, it is responsive to the wishes and commands of its master, but not under any magical obligation to obey them.</p><p>A living tattoo can separate from its bearer at will, becoming a distinct, three-dimensional physical being. A living tattoo can only use its abilities when in full physical form.</p><p>The exact nature of a living tattoo's combat abilities vary with the design of the creature. Exact details on some of the more common types are provided at the conclusion of this entry.</p><p>No matter what form they take, living tattoos can only be hit by magical weapons of +1 or better enchantment.</p><p>Once bonded to a living tattoo, the character's life force is fundamentally tied to the spirit's. If the tattoo dies the character must make a system shock check or perish as well from the terrible psychic shock of his spirit-companion's death.</p><p>When a living tattoo loses hit points a character can will the creature one of his own. This process, however, is irreversible. Once the character gives up a hit point it is lost to him forever. Such a sacrifice irnmediately raises the living tattoo to full hit points. Note that this process does not grant the living tattoo an additional permanent hit point.</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Habitat/Society:</b> The living tattoo is utterly bonded to its bearer. It cares nothing for other people or beings except to note how such individuals and beings affect its partner.</p><p>Only the <a href=\"/appendix/humaabsh\">shamans of the Abber nomads</a> know the secret of calling and bonding living tattoos. No Abber nomad has ever told the secret of this process to an outsider, although these shamans can occasionally be persuaded to bond one of the spirit beings to an outsider. Normally, the outsider must perform some service for the Abber nomads in order to earn such an honor.</p><p>The form a living tattoo can take is limited only by the creative and artistic skills of the shaman who designs it. The role the living tattoo is meant to play in the life of its bearer often determines the design. A hunting companion may not make a good guardian, while a guardian may not serve well as an advisor.</p><p>The Abber nomads view the bearing of a living tattoo as both an honor and a responsibility.</p><p>Once the design has been determined the shaman carefully cuts into the skin of his subject with an ink filled thorn or sharpened bone. The process is painful and laborious and the larger tattoos can take up to twelve hours to create. Once the design is complete the subject joins the shaman on the shifting plains of the Nightmare Lands. There the two call to the spirits, importuning one to take up residence in the tattoo. During such prayers the character promises to value the spirit's life as he does his own.</p><p>The character's entreaty will be answered within one day or not at all. The character must make either an Ability check on either his Wisdom or a Strength, whichever is higher. If this is successful a spirit answers the character's summons and takes up residence in the tattoo. Failure indicates no spirit has answered the call; although the character will always have the tattoo, it will never house a spirit.</p><p>There is a 5% chance that an evil spirit will enter the tattoo. This spirit has all the abilities of a normal living tattoo, however it will betray its bearer at the first opportunity. Such tattoos are not truly bonded to their bearers and are merely freed upon the bearer's demise. The DM should make a separate, secret roll to determine if the spirit entering the tattoo is of this type.</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Ecology:</b> A living tattoo can spend up to one month detached from its bearer. The tattoo will fade away and die if it refrains away any longer. as the spirit-being requires contact with its bearer's spiritual essence in order to survive. This contact is the only food a living tattoo requires.</p><p>Whenever a living tattoo is away from its bearer the only sign of the tattoo's presence is a slight tracing of scars that form the outline of the tattoo. Should the bearer survive the death of a tattoo, the entire area of the tattoo blackens and burns, leaving an angry red scar in its place.</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Dark Man</b></p>  <p class=\"ni\">The dark man is almost identical in powers, appearance and abilities to a <a href=\"/appendix/shadow\">shadow</a>. It is not evil, however, reflecting only the outward aspects of a true shadow and not its spiritual depravity.</p><p>The physical tattoo of a dark man is designed by pricking a series of gray and black dyes into the subject's skin. The tattoo covers the bearer's entire back, from the crown of his head to the backs of his heels. Many bearers of this tattoo keep the back of their head shaved out of respect for their companion spirit.</p><p>Except in bright light, the dark man is 70% undetectable due to its shadowy appearance. The dark man most often attacks from behind, attempting to grab its opponent and drain his strength. Every time the dark man scores a successful hit it does 1d4+1 points of damage and drains 1 point of strength. The dark man is immune to <i>sleep</i>, <i>charm</i>, and <i>hold</i> spells.</p><p></p><p class=\"f\"><b>Living Spear</b></p>  <p class=\"ni\">The physical tattoo of a living spear is normally drawn across either the bearer's back or chest. It is possible for a character to bear two living spears, although this is a rare honor accorded to only the noblest of warriors or huntsmen.</p><p>Although living spears can be thrown in battle, they prefer to remain in the hands of their bearer. Living spears enjoy battle greatly. A living spear does 1d6-1 points of damage per hit. In addition, three times per day the spear can excrete a small amount of poison. Anyone hit by a poisoned spear must make a saving throw vs. poison. Anyone failing this roll suffers a -2 penalty on all attack rolls and saving throws for the next 2d6 rounds as his body is wracked with pain. Living spears are immune to all mind-affecting spells.</p><p></p><p class=\"f\"><b>Panther</b></p>  <p class=\"ni\">This tattoo is normally drawn across the bearer's back, with the front paws of the panther draped across the bearer's shoulders and its tail trailing around the bearer's waist. The panther is most often considered a hunting spirit.</p><p>In battle, the panther attacks as a normal <a href=\"/appendix/catgreat\">great cat</a>, using its claws and sharp teeth, doing 1d3, 1d3, and 1d8 points of damage respectively. If both its forepaws hit the panther can rake with its two rear claws doing another 1d4 points of damage each. Panthers are alert creatures who can only be surprised on a 1.</p><p>More than other tattoos, panthers prefer to remain physically separate from their bearer. This is due to their desire to guard their bearer. Panthers trust no other living being save their bearer.</p><p></p><p class=\"f\"><b>Raven</b></p>  <p class=\"ni\">The <a href=\"/appendix/raven\">raven</a> tattoo is always drawn across the bearer's chest, with one wing swooping across the lower part of his face. This positioning represents the wisdom of head and heart the raven brings the bearer. The raven can <i>detect lie</i> at will and is ever-vigilant in protecting its bearers from the falsehoods of others.</p><p>The raven is a knowledge-spirit, yet it will fight to protect itself and its bearer. The raven attacks with its sharp beak doing 1d4+2 points of damage.</p><p>The raven-spirit is immune to illusionary magic of all kinds. The bond between the living tattoo and its bearer conveys this immunity to the bearer as long as the raven can witness the illusion, and thus see through it.</p><p></p><p class=\"f\"><b>Winged Snake</b></p>  <p class=\"ni\">The <a href=\"/appendix/snakwing\">winged snake</a> is a beautiful, multi-colored tattoo that normally is placed along the bearer's back with the snake wrapping around one arm or leg.</p><p>In battle the winged snake receives a -3 bonus to its initiative due to its speed. The poisonous bite of a tattoo-snake does 1d4 points of damage. The next round its acidic poison does an additional 1-8 points of damage to its foe. The <a href=\"/appendix/serpwing\">winged serpent</a> can also attack with its breath weapon, a small shower of burning sparks. The sparks do 2d4 points of damage to anyone within ten feet of the serpent. The winged serpent can use this attack only once per turn. Winged snakes are immune to electrical attacks.</p><p></p><br clear=\"all\" style=\"clear:both; height:0;\">\r\n","images":["<img src=\"grf/rv.gif\" width=\"150\" height=\"75\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Ravenloft\" title=\"Ravenloft\" align=\"right\">","<img src=\"grf/add2_01.gif\" width=\"200\" height=\"56\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Advanced Dungeons & Dragons 2nd Edition\">"],"setting":"Ravenloft","statblock":{"Dark Man":{"Activity Cycle":"Any","Alignment":"Chaotic neutral","Armor Class":"7","Climate/Terrain":"Nightmare Lands","Damage/Attack":"2-5","Diet":"Nil","Frequency":"Very rare","Hit Dice":"3+3","Intelligence":"Low (5-7)","Magic Resistance":"Nil","Morale":"Steady (11-12)","Movement":"12","No. Appearing":"1","No. of Attacks":"1","Organization":"Bonded","Size":"M (6')","Special Attacks":"Strength drain","Special Defenses":"+1 or better;<br>spell immunity","THAC0":"17","Treasure":"Nil","XP Value":"420"},"Living Spear":{"Activity Cycle":"Any","Alignment":"Neutral","Armor Class":"1","Climate/Terrain":"Nightmare Lands","Damage/Attack":"2-7 (1d6+1)","Diet":"Nil","Frequency":"Rare","Hit Dice":"2+2","Intelligence":"Animal (1)","Magic Resistance":"Nil","Morale":"Steady (11-12)","Movement":"Nil","No. Appearing":"1-2","No. of Attacks":"1","Organization":"Bonded","Size":"M (4-5')","Special Attacks":"Poison","Special Defenses":"+1 or better;<br>spell immunity","THAC0":"19","Treasure":"Nil","XP Value":"420"},"Panther":{"Activity Cycle":"Any","Alignment":"Neutral","Armor Class":"6","Climate/Terrain":"Nightmare Lands","Damage/Attack":"1-3/1-3/1-8","Diet":"Nil","Frequency":"Rare","Hit Dice":"3+2","Intelligence":"Semi- (2-4)","Magic Resistance":"Nil","Morale":"Steady (11-12)","Movement":"15","No. Appearing":"1","No. of Attacks":"3","Organization":"Bonded","Size":"M (5-6')","Special Attacks":"Surprise, rear claw rake","Special Defenses":"+1 or better,<br>surprised on 1","THAC0":"17","Treasure":"Nil","XP Value":"270"},"Raven":{"Activity Cycle":"Any","Alignment":"Neutral good","Armor Class":"6","Climate/Terrain":"Nightmare Lands","Damage/Attack":"3-6 (1d4+2)","Diet":"Nil","Frequency":"Rare","Hit Dice":"2+2","Intelligence":"Very (11-12)","Magic Resistance":"Nil","Morale":"Elite (13-14)","Movement":"1, Fl 36 (B)","No. Appearing":"1","No. of Attacks":"1","Organization":"Bonded","Size":"S (3')","Special Attacks":"<i>Detect lie</i>","Special Defenses":"+1 or better,<br>resist illusions","THAC0":"19","Treasure":"Nil","XP Value":"420"},"Winged Snake":{"Activity Cycle":"Any","Alignment":"Neutral","Armor Class":"5","Climate/Terrain":"Nightmare Lands","Damage/Attack":"1-4","Diet":"Nil","Frequency":"Very Rare","Hit Dice":"4+4","Intelligence":"Average (8-10)","Magic Resistance":"Nil","Morale":"Elite (13-14)","Movement":"12, Fl 18 (B)","No. Appearing":"1","No. of Attacks":"1","Organization":"Bonded","Size":"M (4-5')","Special Attacks":"Poison, spark shower","Special Defenses":"+1 or better,<br>resist electricity","THAC0":"17","Treasure":"Feathers","XP Value":"975"}},"title":"Living Tattoo"},"sources":["2153"],"statblock_names":[],"title":"Living Tattoo","prev_key":"livistee","next_key":"liviwall","monster_path":"/appendix/livitatt"}},"staticQueryHashes":[],"slicesMap":{}}
