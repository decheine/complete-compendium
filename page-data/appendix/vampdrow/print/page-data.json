While the powers listed above are the most common, some aarakocra have different or additional powers.</p><p class=\"f\">A race of intelligent, birdlike creatures living in the deepest deserts of Athas, the rare Athasian <a href=\"/appendix/aarakocr\">aarakocra</a> spends its time soaring on thermals in search of food.</p><p>The aarakocra is 7 to 8 feet tall with a wingspan of 20 feet or more. Because of its large wingspan, an aarakocra can carry as much as 75% of its own body weight and still fly easily. An aarakocra can fly a short distance carrying a burden equaling 125% of its own body weight. The average body weight of a full grown male is 100 pounds and a female is 85 pounds.</p><p>Each wing has a &ldquo;hand&rdquo; at its midpoint, consisting of three fingers and an opposable thumb. The fourth finger forms the rigid leading edge of the wing. In flight the hands cannot be used, but on the ground the aarakocra can use its hands almost as a human would. The aarakocra's body is protected by a thin bony plate on the chest, much like a solid rib cage. Talons on its legs can be used as claws and can be retracted to reveal a second set of hands, also with three fingers and an opposable thumb. Except for the chest plate, the entire skeleton is hollow and extremely fragile.</p><p>From a distance, the Athasian aarakocra resembles a huge <a href=\"/appendix/bird\">vulture</a>. Its black eyes, set in the front of the head, provide excellent vision over a long range. The plumage is generally black with a white collar for adult males and black or brown with a smaller white collar for females. Adolescents are a mixture of brown and black. The beak is large and covers most of the head. Plumage begins at the crown of the head and is darker near the head, except for the collar. Athasian aarakocra speak their own language and the languages of vultures and other large birds. Some speak the common tongue (5% to 10% chance depending on how deep in the wastelands a tribe lives).</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Combat:</b> Aarakocra can fight in the air or on the ground. They prefer aerial combat since their bones are too fragile to withstand a solid blow from a human-sized opponent. In combat against creatures on the ground, they prefer to fly over their victim and drop weighted nets. Some aarakocra use darts to harass ground-based opponents.</p><p>If their opponents can fly, the aarakocra generally forgo the use of the net, although large groups sometimes use nets on flying creatures. Normally, aarakocra attack flying creatures with long spears, diving from above and allowing the momentum to carry the spear through the target. Such an attack doubles the damage if the aarakocra have been able to dive at least 50 feet. Only the very largest aarakocra can carry more than one of these spears, they can attack with both at once with no penalty, causing double damage on each strike. All diving attacks are made at +4 and should be treated as a charge attack. All other penalties and restrictions of charge attacks apply.</p><p>The effect of the aarakocra's nets depends on if the opponent is flying at the time it becomes entangled. Creatures on the ground that are hit by a net are entangled and unable to participate in any combat until they make a successful Strength check to get free of the net. Flying creatures hit by a net can no longer fly and immediately begin falling. If they cannot escape the net or use some magical means to arrest the fall, normal falling damage applies.</p><p>Unless victims are entangled in nets, aarakocra are cautious in ground combat. If the aarakocra outnumber their opponents they advance in a straight line and thrust with their spears. If outnumbered, or the opponents are particularly tough, the aarakocra withdraw. Victims entangled in nets are killed or incapacitated for use as food or ransom.</p><p>Athasian aarakocra are mindful of their physical limitations as well as their comparatively low psionic abilities. They do not normally initiate psionic combat. At the first sign of psionic powers from any of their victims, however, all aarakocra that have some ability will use whatever attack and defense modes they can in an attempt to destroy the threat. Large groups of is or more aarakocra may initiate psionic combat if their leaders feel they can win quickly and avoid physical combat.</p><p>In desperation, an aarakocra can attempt to bite an opponent in combat. Because of the unwieldiness of its beak, the aarakocra has a THAC0 of 18 if attacking with this appendage. Further, the birdman causes only 1d2 points of damage with the beak.</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Habitat/Society:</b> Athasian aarakocra live in tribes with 6-20 (2d8+4) members, depending on the prestige of the leader. The largest tribe ever recorded had 50 members. The tribal hunting territory depends on the size of the tribe, usually about 500 square miles for a tribe of 10 members. There are no rigid boundaries between tribes and border disputes are not uncommon.</p><p>Alignments of tribe members are similar to the alignment of the leader. A tribe that has a leader who is neutral good may have neutral good, chaotic good, lawful good, and true neutral members. A predominantly evil tribe does not recognize boundaries with other tribes and treats other tribes as inferior beings to be eliminated.</p><p>Athasian aarakocra aren't happy in enclosed spaces, but they they take refuge in a cave or building if necessary.</p><p>Nonevil tribes live in rocky aeries in the highest peaks they can find. Evil tribes are normally nomadic and use an aerie made by another tribe if they need to remain in an area for a long time, even if they have to evict the tribe that made the nest.</p><p>Aarakocra aren't friendly toward intruders in their territory, especially caravans. They try to extract a toll from the caravan for passage through the desert. Good-aligned tribes allow unhindered passage of caravans that pay a tribute. If someone refuses to pay the tribute, the aarakocra try to capture scouts or outriders from the party and hold them until an even larger tribute is paid. The payment may be either livestock or shiny objects. Aarakocra are smart enough not to be taken in by glass baubles instead of gems, although they cannot tell the difference between the more common gems and the rare ones.</p><p>Evil tribes ask for tribute and often attack a caravan whether it pays or not. Aarakocra always demand shiny objects such as stones. These tribes find humans and demihumans to be quite tasty and prefer them to other food.</p><p>Good-aligned tribes of aarakocra sometimes return a lost traveler to the edge of the desert after first removing any valuables the traveler may be carrying. On very rare occasions a tribe might return a lost group of travelers to the more frequently traveled parts of the desert, again after first taking any valuables as payment.</p><p>The oldest male is the leader of the tribal hunting party and has 4+4 Hit Dice. The oldest female is in charge of the tribal aerie and has 3+3 HD. In tribes that have more than 15 members, the next oldest aarakocra serves as shaman and has 3+3 HD; the shaman completes the triumvirate necessary for proper worship and the summoning of elementals. (Interestingly, no magic-using aarakocra has ever been recorded.) Tribes without a shaman cannot summon <a href=\"/appendix/element1\">air elementals</a>, which is an important part of aarakocra culture.</p><p>The shaman is the leader of the daily sun worship. Aarakocra worship the sun because it provides them with the thermals they need to soar in search of food. The shaman also leads the mystic rituals used to summon an air elemental. Summoning an air elemental is usually done only in preparation for the tribe's most sacred ceremony, the hunt. Small tribes must band together for this ceremony to allow the triumvirate to be formed.</p><p>The ceremony to summon an air elemental must be conducted at dawn and requires the oldest male and female to emit a highpitched keening whistle. The shaman conducts an intricate dance around them, simultaneously chanting an ancient summoning mantra.</p><p>The hunt is the final part of the initiation of adolescent aarakocra to adulthood and often takes the tribe far from their normal teritory. The target is always a <a href=\"/appendix/drakalsi\">silt drake</a>. The hunt is the only time the females leave the relative safety of the nest. Even an evil tribe will not interfere with a tribe on a hunt. An air elemental is often summoned to help find the drake, but never takes part in the actual combat. Although the adult members of the tribe take part in the initial phases of the combat, it is the initiates who deliver the final, killing blows to me drake. Scars from the hunt are considered a mark of pride among all aarakocra.</p><p>The females spend about eight months of the year incubating their eggs. Athasian aarakocra mate for life and a pair normally produces as many as 10 offspring. A female lays one egg a year. Constant incubation is not required because of the high daytime temperatures, so the females can maintain the nest and keep the tribe's treasure in order.</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Ecology:</b> Athasian aarakocra are high on the food chain and have no natural enemies other than <a href=\"/appendix/drakatha\">drakes</a>. Unless evil, aarakocra leave their own territory only to hunt the silt drake and return as soon as possible when the hunt is over. (Evil aarakocra attack others, as noted above.) Aarakocra eggs and hatchlings are sought after by wealthy land owners who wish to use the creatures as scouts and sentries. An egg can bring as much as 10 cp in Tyr's marketplace. Tribes that have had eggs or hatchlings stolen have long memories and sometimes take revenge against the thief at a later date. Captive aarakocra join any tribe they come in contact with.</p><p>Athasian aarakocra have a natural life span of 21-30 years.</p><br clear=\"all\" style=\"clear:both; height:0;\">\r\n","images":["<img src=\"grf/ds.gif\" width=\"150\" height=\"75\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Dark Sun\" title=\"Dark Sun\" align=\"right\">","<img src=\"img/aarakath.gif\" alt=\"Aarakocra (Athas)\" title=\"Aarakocra (Athas)\" border=\"0\" width=\"300\" height=\"360\" style=\"text-align:right;\" align=\"right\">","<img src=\"grf/add2_01.gif\" width=\"200\" height=\"56\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Advanced Dungeons & Dragons 2nd Edition\">"],"setting":"Dark Sun","statblock":{"Aarakocra (Athas)":{"Activity Cycle":"Day","Alignment":"Any","Armor Class":"7","Climate/Terrain":"Deep desert","Damage/Attack":"1d3/1d3 or by weapon","Diet":"Carnivore","Frequency":"Rare","Hit Dice":"2+2","Intelligence":"Average (8-10)","Magic Resistance":"Nil","Morale":"Steady (11)","Movement":"6, Fl 36 (C)","No. Appearing":"1d10","No. of Attacks":"2","Organization":"Tribal","Size":"M (20'+ wingspan)","Special Attacks":"Nil","Special Defenses":"Nil","THAC0":"17","Treasure":"Varies","XP Value":"65"}},"title":"Aarakocra (Athas)"},"sources":["2433"],"statblock_names":[],"title":"Aarakocra (Athas)","prev_key":"zygraat","next_key":"aarakocr","monster_path":"/appendix/aarakath"}}},"pageContext":{"monster_key":"vampdrow","monster_data":{"TSR":["2153"],"fullBody":"  <table cellspacing=\"0\" cellpadding=\"0\"><tr><th>Climate/Terrain:</th><td>Subterranean</td></tr><tr><th>Frequency:</th><td>Very rare</td></tr><tr><th>Organization:</th><td>Solitary</td></tr><tr><th>Activity Cycle:</th><td>Night</td></tr><tr><th>Diet:</th><td>Special</td></tr><tr><th>Intelligence:</th><td>Exceptional (15-16)</td></tr><tr><th>Treasure:</th><td>I&times;2</td></tr><tr><th>Alignment:</th><td>Chaotic evil</td></tr><tr><th>No. Appearing:</th><td>1</td></tr><tr><th>Armor Class:</th><td>0</td></tr><tr><th>Movement:</th><td>12</td></tr><tr><th>Hit Dice:</th><td>8+3</td></tr><tr><th>THAC0:</th><td>13</td></tr><tr><th>No. of Attacks:</th><td>1 or 2</td></tr><tr><th>Damage/Attack:</th><td>1d4+4/1d4+4</td></tr><tr><th>Special Attacks:</th><td>Spells, cause awe, drain fluids, poison, and see below</td></tr><tr><th>Special Defenses:</th><td>Spells, +1 or better weapon to hit, immune to poison, regeneration, and see below</td></tr><tr><th>Magic Resistance:</th><td>25%</td></tr><tr><th>Size:</th><td>M (5' tall)</td></tr><tr><th>Morale:</th><td>Elite (13-14)</td></tr><tr><th>XP Value:</th><td>7,000 (+1,000 per 100 years of age)</td></tr></table><p class=\"f\">Unlike most races, the <a href=\"/appendix/elfdrow\">drow</a> consider it an honor to be granted the <i>Kiss of Lolth</i>, as they refer to vampirism. The <a href=\"/appendix/elfdrow\">dark elves</a> view <a href=\"/appendix/vampire\">vampires</a> with both awe and trepidation, believing undeath to be a state of being that brings an elf closer to a true understanding of the powers that surge through the universe. Such knowledge brings immense power, which the dark elves both crave and respect.</p><p>The vast majority of drew vampires are female, although a such a creature occasionally honors a male with the transformation. Drow vampires are almost identical in appearance to the living members of their race. They are of slight build, approximately 5' in height with long, pale hair and dusky skin. The features of such vampires are almost radiantly beautiful in their refinement. Even the vampires' skin emanates a faint, pearlescent glow. This radiance can only be seen out of the corner of the viewer's eye and its near-visibility is often distracting. Drow vampires normally dress in luxurious, but somber, garments and carry both an adamantine dagger and short sword.</p><p>Drow vampires retain their knowledge of the languages of intelligent underworld creatures as well as their own language of gestures and body movements. In addition, these vampires can communicate with all animal species who make their home in the underworld.</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Combat:</b> Drow vampires, like their living counterparts, are skilled in battle. These vampires are extraordinarily fond of causing pain and consider battle an art form in which the object is to cause their victims to suffer as much as possible before granting them the release of death. The vampires view each slice of anguish as an offering to Lolth.</p><p>The transformation to vampiric form grants the undead drow an 18/76 Strength. This gives the creatures a natural bonus of +2 on all melee attack rolls and +4 to the damage caused by any physical attacks. This bonus is separate from the +2 a drow receives when using its adamantine short sword and dagger. When using these weapons, drow vampires can attack with both weapons in a single round.</p><p>As in life, drow vampires can see the heat emitted by living bodies up to 120 feet distant. Similarly, they can detect sliding or shifting walls, stonework traps, or their distance underground five times in six.</p><p>Drow vampires retain a measure of their race's innate ability to cast spells. They can cast the following spells once per day: <i>darkness</i>, <i>continual darkness</i>, <i>levitate</i>, <i>know alignment</i>, <i>detect magic</i>, <i>dispel magic</i>, and <i>suggestion</i>. They cast these at the 8th level of ability.</p><p>Additionally, drow vampires retain a portion of their race's powerful magic resistance. Drow vampires have a 25% resistance to magic. Sages theorize that the magic resistance of drow vampires must lower somewhat in order for the creature to manifest its unlife. However, as the creatures age and their connection to the negative material plane strengthens, their magic resistance begins to increase (see &ldquo;Habitat/Society&rdquo; below).</p><p>A drow vampire can <i>cause awe</i> with its merest gaze. Anyone looking into the vampire's pale eyes must make a saving throw vs. spell. Failure means the character stands awestruck before the vampire for 2d4 melee rounds. Awestruck characters automatically drop anything they are holding. Affected victims will not attack or even approach the drow vampire unless the creature attacks them. As the drow ages it becomes more difficult for victims not to become awestruck by the monster's imperious gaze (see &ldquo;Habitat/Society&rdquo;).</p><p>The dread touch of the vampire drow drains the very fluids from its victim's body. Each successful unarmed melee attack enables the undead drow to drain 1d6+1 hit points from its victim. Each time the vampire uses this hideous attack, the victim permanently loses 1 hit point. Such draining is excruciatingly painful and leaves a small welt where the drow touched its victim's flesh. Only the <i>heal</i> spell will remove these angry welts that the drow refer to as <i>Lolth's caress</i>. The vampire can absorb any hit points it drains from its victims in this manner, although the creature will never have more than its maximum number of hit points. Any drow brought to 0 hit points by this attack becomes a vampire. Victims of other races merely die in unendurable agony, sacrifices to Lolth and her vampire minion.</p><p>A vampire drow can only be hit by weapons of +1 or greater enchantment. Unenchanted weapons pass through the monster as if it were vapor. The monster regenerates 3 hit points per round when in absolute darkness.</p><p>If reduced to 0 hit points a vampire drow is not slain. Instead, the monster is forced to take its poisonous vapor form (see below). If the drow cannot reach the safety of its stony tomb within 12 turns the vapors dissipate and the vampire is destroyed. If it does reach its tomb the vampire must rest for eight hours, after which the foul creature is fully restored.</p><p>Although a vampire drow is unaffected by holy water, water drawn directly from a waterfall does 2d4 points of damage to the monster. If the creature is held completely within the downpour of a waterfall itself, the vampire will be destroyed when it reaches 0 hit points. Holy symbols have no effect on a vampire drow.</p><p>Like all vampires, these monsters are immune to all manner of mind-affecting spells. These include, but are not limited to, <i>sleep</i>, <i>charm</i>, and <i>hold</i>. They are also immune to poisons and cannot be suffocated or drowned. Spells that depend upon cold or electricity do only half damage to drow vampires.</p><p>Of all vampires, the drow are the most adversely affected by light. A vampire drow will almost never emerge onto the surface of Ravenloft as even one ray of sunlight will instantaneously destroy it. Even moonlight does damage to the monster, doing 2d4 points of damage per round. The 5th level priest spell <i>moonbeam</i> does similar damage to the vampire. Starlight does not damage the vampire, but the creature is incapable of regeneration while touched by starshine. Magical illumination, such as <i>light</i> or <i>continual light</i>, does 1d4 points of damage per round that the vampire is exposed to such illumination. The vampire cannot regenerate under these conditions and will do everything in its power to destroy the light source.</p><p>Drow vampires can take the form of <a href=\"/appendix/spider\">giant spiders</a>. While in this form, such vampires can control 10d10 Hit Dice of <a href=\"/appendix/spider\">spiders</a>. The creatures will arrive within 2d10 rounds of summoning. The exact type of spiders summoned depends on the nature of the spiders in the immediate area. In normal form, drow vampires can control up to four <a href=\"/appendix/elfdrow\">driders</a>. Driders worship vampire drow, seeing the monsters as Lolth's chosen ones.</p><p>A drow vampire can change into <i>poisonous vapors</i> at will. This ability is similar to a normal vampire's <i>gaseous form</i>, save that any creature that breathes in any portion of these vapors must make a saving throw vs. poison with a -2 penalty. Failure means the victim takes 2d6 points of damage. Those who make this saving throw take only half damage from the fumes. While in this form, the vampire can only be hit by weapons of +3 or greater enchantment.</p><p>A vampire drow cannot cross a line of salt (even when in vaporous form). The vampire finds pure salt repugnant and can only act indirectly to break such a barrier. For instance, the vampire might summon spiders to scatter the salt or use a <i>suggestion</i> spell to get someone else to break the line. If there is even the slightest break in the line the vampire drow can cross with impunity.</p><p>Because of their strong connection with the spider goddess, Lolth, vampire drow are more difficult for priests to turn than most undead, being turned as ghosts.</p><p>A vampire drow can be immobilized by impaling the monster through the heart with a stake made of rock salt, although this in itself will not permanently destroy the monster. Once the stake is removed, the monster will immediately begin to regenerate. Only exposing the creature to the rays of the sun, immersing it in the pounding torrent of a waterfall, or binding the corpse with cords woven of silver thread, smearing it with oil, and burning the body for at least twelve hours will ensure the vampire's destruction.</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Habitat/Society:</b> Vampire drow rarely ever leave the deepest levels of their caverns, and it is almost unheard of for such creatures to appear on the surface itself. Instead, these vampires spend years within elaborate underground tombs constructed by drider slaves. Such tombs are exquisite yet disturbing works of art with carvings ranging from twisted masses of limbs to horrifying faces fighting to swallow themselves. These tombs often serve as temples to Lolth as well as homes for the vampires.</p><p>Aloof and convinced of its superiority, the vampire drow is perhaps the most reluctant of all undead to create progeny. Only rarely does the drow vampire feel the loneliness of its existence. and it enjoys keeping its place in Lolth's heart as exclusive as possible.</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Ecology:</b> The vampire drow revels in its great power and ability to cause pain. Such a monster is perhaps one of the cruelest creatures found on the Demiplane of Dread. The monsters are said to particularly enjoy torturing <a href=\"/appendix/dwarf\">dwarves</a> and drow of different noble factions than the vampire's own.</p><p>The surface of the dark and twisted tomb-homes of drow vampire are often coated with a contact poison that burns fiercely, causing much pain but doing only 1 point of damage per dose. Drider are known to purposely poison themselves with this substance to show their loyalty to Lolth and her vampire servant.</p><p>Vampire drow truly believe themselves the favored of Lolth. They occasionally speak with Lolth's priestesses, but otherwise remain aloof from drow society save when they wish a new victim to torture for their own perverse amusement.</p><p>As the centuries pass, the vampire grows more and more powerful. The following chart details this advancement:</p><table class=\"ip\"><tr class=\"bk\"><th>Age</th><th>HD</th><th>Drain</th><th>Attack</th><th>Awe</th><th>MR</th></tr><tr><td>0-99</td><td>8+3</td><td>+1</td><td>+1</td><td>0</td><td>25%</td></tr><tr><td>100-199</td><td>9+3</td><td>+1</td><td>+1</td><td>-1</td><td>30%</td></tr><tr><td>200-299</td><td>10</td><td>+2</td><td>+1</td><td>-1</td><td>35%</td></tr><tr><td>300-399</td><td>11</td><td>+2</td><td>+2</td><td>-2</td><td>40%</td></tr><tr><td>400-499</td><td>12</td><td>+3</td><td>+2</td><td>-2</td><td>45%</td></tr><tr><td>500+</td><td>13</td><td>+4</td><td>+2</td><td>-3</td><td>50%</td></tr></table><p class=\"ni\"><i>HD</i> indicates the number of Hit Dice a vampire has at a given age.<br><i>Drain</i> indicates the amount of hit points worth of fluid the vampire can drain.
