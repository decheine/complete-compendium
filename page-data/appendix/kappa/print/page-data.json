While the powers listed above are the most common, some aarakocra have different or additional powers.</p><p class=\"f\">A race of intelligent, birdlike creatures living in the deepest deserts of Athas, the rare Athasian <a href=\"/appendix/aarakocr\">aarakocra</a> spends its time soaring on thermals in search of food.</p><p>The aarakocra is 7 to 8 feet tall with a wingspan of 20 feet or more. Because of its large wingspan, an aarakocra can carry as much as 75% of its own body weight and still fly easily. An aarakocra can fly a short distance carrying a burden equaling 125% of its own body weight. The average body weight of a full grown male is 100 pounds and a female is 85 pounds.</p><p>Each wing has a &ldquo;hand&rdquo; at its midpoint, consisting of three fingers and an opposable thumb. The fourth finger forms the rigid leading edge of the wing. In flight the hands cannot be used, but on the ground the aarakocra can use its hands almost as a human would. The aarakocra's body is protected by a thin bony plate on the chest, much like a solid rib cage. Talons on its legs can be used as claws and can be retracted to reveal a second set of hands, also with three fingers and an opposable thumb. Except for the chest plate, the entire skeleton is hollow and extremely fragile.</p><p>From a distance, the Athasian aarakocra resembles a huge <a href=\"/appendix/bird\">vulture</a>. Its black eyes, set in the front of the head, provide excellent vision over a long range. The plumage is generally black with a white collar for adult males and black or brown with a smaller white collar for females. Adolescents are a mixture of brown and black. The beak is large and covers most of the head. Plumage begins at the crown of the head and is darker near the head, except for the collar. Athasian aarakocra speak their own language and the languages of vultures and other large birds. Some speak the common tongue (5% to 10% chance depending on how deep in the wastelands a tribe lives).</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Combat:</b> Aarakocra can fight in the air or on the ground. They prefer aerial combat since their bones are too fragile to withstand a solid blow from a human-sized opponent. In combat against creatures on the ground, they prefer to fly over their victim and drop weighted nets. Some aarakocra use darts to harass ground-based opponents.</p><p>If their opponents can fly, the aarakocra generally forgo the use of the net, although large groups sometimes use nets on flying creatures. Normally, aarakocra attack flying creatures with long spears, diving from above and allowing the momentum to carry the spear through the target. Such an attack doubles the damage if the aarakocra have been able to dive at least 50 feet. Only the very largest aarakocra can carry more than one of these spears, they can attack with both at once with no penalty, causing double damage on each strike. All diving attacks are made at +4 and should be treated as a charge attack. All other penalties and restrictions of charge attacks apply.</p><p>The effect of the aarakocra's nets depends on if the opponent is flying at the time it becomes entangled. Creatures on the ground that are hit by a net are entangled and unable to participate in any combat until they make a successful Strength check to get free of the net. Flying creatures hit by a net can no longer fly and immediately begin falling. If they cannot escape the net or use some magical means to arrest the fall, normal falling damage applies.</p><p>Unless victims are entangled in nets, aarakocra are cautious in ground combat. If the aarakocra outnumber their opponents they advance in a straight line and thrust with their spears. If outnumbered, or the opponents are particularly tough, the aarakocra withdraw. Victims entangled in nets are killed or incapacitated for use as food or ransom.</p><p>Athasian aarakocra are mindful of their physical limitations as well as their comparatively low psionic abilities. They do not normally initiate psionic combat. At the first sign of psionic powers from any of their victims, however, all aarakocra that have some ability will use whatever attack and defense modes they can in an attempt to destroy the threat. Large groups of is or more aarakocra may initiate psionic combat if their leaders feel they can win quickly and avoid physical combat.</p><p>In desperation, an aarakocra can attempt to bite an opponent in combat. Because of the unwieldiness of its beak, the aarakocra has a THAC0 of 18 if attacking with this appendage. Further, the birdman causes only 1d2 points of damage with the beak.</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Habitat/Society:</b> Athasian aarakocra live in tribes with 6-20 (2d8+4) members, depending on the prestige of the leader. The largest tribe ever recorded had 50 members. The tribal hunting territory depends on the size of the tribe, usually about 500 square miles for a tribe of 10 members. There are no rigid boundaries between tribes and border disputes are not uncommon.</p><p>Alignments of tribe members are similar to the alignment of the leader. A tribe that has a leader who is neutral good may have neutral good, chaotic good, lawful good, and true neutral members. A predominantly evil tribe does not recognize boundaries with other tribes and treats other tribes as inferior beings to be eliminated.</p><p>Athasian aarakocra aren't happy in enclosed spaces, but they they take refuge in a cave or building if necessary.</p><p>Nonevil tribes live in rocky aeries in the highest peaks they can find. Evil tribes are normally nomadic and use an aerie made by another tribe if they need to remain in an area for a long time, even if they have to evict the tribe that made the nest.</p><p>Aarakocra aren't friendly toward intruders in their territory, especially caravans. They try to extract a toll from the caravan for passage through the desert. Good-aligned tribes allow unhindered passage of caravans that pay a tribute. If someone refuses to pay the tribute, the aarakocra try to capture scouts or outriders from the party and hold them until an even larger tribute is paid. The payment may be either livestock or shiny objects. Aarakocra are smart enough not to be taken in by glass baubles instead of gems, although they cannot tell the difference between the more common gems and the rare ones.</p><p>Evil tribes ask for tribute and often attack a caravan whether it pays or not. Aarakocra always demand shiny objects such as stones. These tribes find humans and demihumans to be quite tasty and prefer them to other food.</p><p>Good-aligned tribes of aarakocra sometimes return a lost traveler to the edge of the desert after first removing any valuables the traveler may be carrying. On very rare occasions a tribe might return a lost group of travelers to the more frequently traveled parts of the desert, again after first taking any valuables as payment.</p><p>The oldest male is the leader of the tribal hunting party and has 4+4 Hit Dice. The oldest female is in charge of the tribal aerie and has 3+3 HD. In tribes that have more than 15 members, the next oldest aarakocra serves as shaman and has 3+3 HD; the shaman completes the triumvirate necessary for proper worship and the summoning of elementals. (Interestingly, no magic-using aarakocra has ever been recorded.) Tribes without a shaman cannot summon <a href=\"/appendix/element1\">air elementals</a>, which is an important part of aarakocra culture.</p><p>The shaman is the leader of the daily sun worship. Aarakocra worship the sun because it provides them with the thermals they need to soar in search of food. The shaman also leads the mystic rituals used to summon an air elemental. Summoning an air elemental is usually done only in preparation for the tribe's most sacred ceremony, the hunt. Small tribes must band together for this ceremony to allow the triumvirate to be formed.</p><p>The ceremony to summon an air elemental must be conducted at dawn and requires the oldest male and female to emit a highpitched keening whistle. The shaman conducts an intricate dance around them, simultaneously chanting an ancient summoning mantra.</p><p>The hunt is the final part of the initiation of adolescent aarakocra to adulthood and often takes the tribe far from their normal teritory. The target is always a <a href=\"/appendix/drakalsi\">silt drake</a>. The hunt is the only time the females leave the relative safety of the nest. Even an evil tribe will not interfere with a tribe on a hunt. An air elemental is often summoned to help find the drake, but never takes part in the actual combat. Although the adult members of the tribe take part in the initial phases of the combat, it is the initiates who deliver the final, killing blows to me drake. Scars from the hunt are considered a mark of pride among all aarakocra.</p><p>The females spend about eight months of the year incubating their eggs. Athasian aarakocra mate for life and a pair normally produces as many as 10 offspring. A female lays one egg a year. Constant incubation is not required because of the high daytime temperatures, so the females can maintain the nest and keep the tribe's treasure in order.</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Ecology:</b> Athasian aarakocra are high on the food chain and have no natural enemies other than <a href=\"/appendix/drakatha\">drakes</a>. Unless evil, aarakocra leave their own territory only to hunt the silt drake and return as soon as possible when the hunt is over. (Evil aarakocra attack others, as noted above.) Aarakocra eggs and hatchlings are sought after by wealthy land owners who wish to use the creatures as scouts and sentries. An egg can bring as much as 10 cp in Tyr's marketplace. Tribes that have had eggs or hatchlings stolen have long memories and sometimes take revenge against the thief at a later date. Captive aarakocra join any tribe they come in contact with.</p><p>Athasian aarakocra have a natural life span of 21-30 years.</p>\n","images":["<img src=\"grf/ds.gif\" width=\"150\" height=\"75\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Dark Sun\" title=\"Dark Sun\" align=\"right\">","<img src=\"img/aarakath.gif\" alt=\"Aarakocra (Athas)\" title=\"Aarakocra (Athas)\" border=\"0\" width=\"300\" height=\"360\" style=\"text-align:right;\" align=\"right\">","<img src=\"grf/add2_01.gif\" width=\"200\" height=\"56\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Advanced Dungeons & Dragons 2nd Edition\">"],"setting":"Dark Sun","statblock":{"Aarakocra (Athas)":{"Activity Cycle":"Day","Alignment":"Any","Armor Class":"7","Climate/Terrain":"Deep desert","Damage/Attack":"1d3/1d3 or by weapon","Diet":"Carnivore","Frequency":"Rare","Hit Dice":"2+2","Intelligence":"Average (8-10)","Magic Resistance":"Nil","Morale":"Steady (11)","Movement":"6, Fl 36 (C)","No. Appearing":"1d10","No. of Attacks":"2","Organization":"Tribal","Size":"M (20'+ wingspan)","Special Attacks":"Nil","Special Defenses":"Nil","THAC0":"17","Treasure":"Varies","XP Value":"65"}},"title":"Aarakocra (Athas)"},"sources":["2433"],"statblock_names":[],"title":"Aarakocra (Athas)","prev_key":"zygraat","next_key":"aarakocr","monster_path":"/appendix/aarakath"}}},"pageContext":{"monster_key":"kappa","monster_data":{"TSR":["2116"],"fullBody":"  <table cellspacing=\"0\" cellpadding=\"0\"><tr class=\"bk\"><th> </th><th class=\"cn\">Common Kappa</th><th class=\"cn\">Kappa-Ti</th><th class=\"cn\">Vampiric Kappa</th></tr><tr><th>Climate/Terrain:</th><td>Tropical, subtropical, and temperate lakes and rivers</td><td>Tropical, subtropical, and temperate lakes and rivers</td><td>Tropical, subtropical, and temperate water</td></tr><tr><th>Frequency:</th><td>Rare</td><td>Very rare</td><td>Very rare</td></tr><tr><th>Organization:</th><td>Family</td><td>Solitary</td><td>Solitary</td></tr><tr><th>Activity Cycle:</th><td>Any</td><td>Any</td><td>Night</td></tr><tr><th>Diet:</th><td>Carnivore</td><td>Carnivore</td><td>Carnivore</td></tr><tr><th>Intelligence:</th><td>Low to average (5-10)</td><td>Low to average (5-10)</td><td>Average (8-10)</td></tr><tr><th>Treasure:</th><td>D</td><td>D</td><td>D</td></tr><tr><th>Alignment:</th><td>Chaotic evil</td><td>Chaotic evil</td><td>Chaotic evil</td></tr><tr><th>No. Appearing:</th><td>1-6</td><td>1</td><td>1-2</td></tr><tr><th>Armor Class:</th><td>3/-2</td><td>3</td><td>0/-2</td></tr><tr><th>Movement:</th><td>6, Sw 18</td><td>12, Sw 36</td><td>9, Sw 18</td></tr><tr><th>Hit Dice:</th><td>4</td><td>8</td><td>7+7</td></tr><tr><th>THAC0:</th><td>17</td><td>13</td><td>13</td></tr><tr><th>No. of Attacks:</th><td>2</td><td>2</td><td>3</td></tr><tr><th>Damage/Attack:</th><td>5-10/5-10</td><td>10-20/10-20</td><td>5-10/5-10/1-6</td></tr><tr><th>Special Attacks:</th><td>Nil</td><td>Nil</td><td>Strength drain</td></tr><tr><th>Special Defenses:</th><td>Regeneration</td><td>Regeneration, camouflage</td><td>Regeneration</td></tr><tr><th>Magic Resistance:</th><td>Nil</td><td>Nil</td><td>Nil</td></tr><tr><th>Size:</th><td>S (2' tall)</td><td>M (4-5' tall)</td><td>S (3' tall)</td></tr><tr><th>Morale:</th><td>Steady (11)</td><td>Steady (11)</td><td>Steady (12)</td></tr><tr><th>XP Value:</th><td>270</td><td>1,400</td><td>2,000</td></tr></table><p class=\"f\">The kappa are a race of amphibious humanoids who live in freshwater lakes, ponds, rivers, and streams.</p><p>They are small creatures, standing about 2' tall and weighing about 20 pounds. All kappa have bent backs and a crouched posture. At a distance, they're often mistaken for small monkeys. A hard shell covers their backs.</p><p>Kappas are covered with scales - usually dark green with yellow splotches, but occasionally dull blue with yellowish brown accents. Both males and females have protruding pot bellies. They also have pouches near the base of their abdomens, like kangaroos. The kappa's feet resemble those of a snapping turtle, each with three webbed toes ending in hooked claws. Their hands are similarly webbed. Long, razor-sharp talons extend from their fingertips. Their heads are flat and plump, and their broad mouths are filled with multiple rows of hooked teeth. Their round, bright eyes are usually red or yellow. A transparent lid covers the eyes, enabling the creature to see clearly underwater. Most kappa have long noses resembling a bird's beak, but some have shorter, more humanlike noses.</p><p>Like other amphibians, kappa are cold-blooded. They are clammy to the touch, and smell vaguely of fish. With their unique lungs, kappa can breathe both water and air.</p><p>The top of a kappa's head is concave, forming a small bowl. The kappa fills the bowl with water from his or her home (a lake, river, or pond). This water is the source of a kappa's strength; if the fluid is spilled, he or she loses vitality. In emergencies, kappa can refill their head-bowls with fresh water from any source. A thin ridge of hair encircles the base of the kappa's head-bowl. The hair is usually cut short, but scholarly and artistic kappa let this hair grow long to symbolize their intellectualism.</p><p>Kappa speak their own language. Most adult kappa also can speak the language common to the area they inhabit.</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Combat:</b> Generally, a kappa's behavior is unpredictable and extreme. They delight in the discomfort of others, but they are usually polite at first, even to potential prey. So self centered are kappa that potential victims sometimes can placate them by complimenting their manners, appealing to their egos, and offering money and valuables. But if the kappa is insulted, hungry, or just plain ornery, it shows no mercy. In many areas of Kara-Tur, kappa are a major cause of drowning, since they enjoy ambushing unsuspecting victims and dragging them beneath the water.</p><p>Despite their small size, all kappa boast incredible Strength (18/00), which grants them a +3 bonus to their attack and damage rolls. In combat, they fight with their clawed hands, viciously rending their victims. Kappa prefer not to use most weapons, but may attack with daggers and darts if they're available. Some kappa arm themselves with rocks.</p><p>With their supple bodies, kappa move fluidly on both land and water. Their ease of movement and tough scales provide an admirable defense. They are difficult to harm from behind, since their protective shell gives them an AC of -2 for rear attacks.</p><p>Each kappa family has developed and mastered its own style of martial arts, including 1-6 special maneuvers in that style. These maneuvers commonly involve grappling and holding. They also include techniques that throw an opponent off balance and inflict maximum damage. Typical special maneuvers are Feint, Concentrated Push, Crushing Blow, Eagle Claw, and Great Throw.</p><p>Kappa are so proud of their prowess as hand-to-hand fighters that they often offer a victim the chance to wrestle. If the victim wins, the kappa will grant him free passage. If he loses, the kappa will drag him underwater and eat him.</p><p>One of the kappa's favorite contests is finger wrestling. The kappa and the victim link their smallest fingers while standing on the shore, then attempt to pull each other into the water. To simulate this contest, the kappa and the victim each attempt a &ldquo;bend bars/lift gates&rdquo; roll. The kappa uses his Strength of 18/00. If both wrestlers succeed or fail in a particular round, nothing happens. If the victim succeeds and the kappa fails, the victim wins and is allowed to go on his way. If the kappa succeeds and the victim fails, the victim has been pulled underwater.</p><p>About 10% of adult male kappa can cast spells. This talent is innate; the spellcaster does not have to memorize the spells. However, the kappa only can cast spells while he is within one mile of his home. The creature casts spells as if he were a wu jen whose level equals the kappa's Hit Dice. For example, a vampiric kappa with this ability has 7 HD; he casts as 7th-level wu jen. Kappa have access to any of the wu jen spells listed in the <i>Oriental Adventures</i> book, but they favor the water-based magic. All kappa are immune to water-based spells.</p><p>Kappa can regenerate 1 hp per round. Although a kappa cannot regrow a severed limb, he can rejoin it to his body if he is left undisturbed to rest for a period of 4-7 (1d4 + 1) weeks.</p><p>The kappa's most vulnerable point is his head-bowl. If this bowl is emptied, the kappa's powers are severely diminished. His Strength becomes normal; typically, that means it drops to 10. He also loses his ability to regenerate damage, and loses 2 hit points per round until the water is restored.</p><p>Emptying the head-bowl is not as likely as it may seem. Although kappa occasionally can be tricked into bowing (and spilling the water), the majority are too clever for this. In combat, the water can be spilled if the opponent makes a successful &ldquo;bend bars/lift gates&rdquo; roll for this purpose, or if he executes an appropriate martial arts maneuver.</p><p>About 5% of all kappa release a <i>death curse</i> when they die. The <i>death curse</i> is cast by the kappa's spirit on the opponents who defeated him in his final battle. Up to four opponents can receive the <i>death curse</i>. Each affected opponent must save vs. death magic exactly four rounds after the kappa's death. Those who fail their saving throws acquire a permanent -4 penalty to their attack and saving throw rolls; additionally, everyone within a 30' radius of a cursed character suffers a -2 penalty to their attack and saving throw rolls for as long as they remain within that radius. The <i>death curse</i> only can be lifted by a <i>remove curse</i> spell cast by a shukenja of 10th level or higher.</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Habitat/Society:</b> Kappa live in bodies of fresh water, making their lairs under rocks and bridges. They have an extreme aversion to salt water, and exposure to salt water for extended periods of time usually is fatal.</p><p>A kappa lair is often marked by a large stump or flat rock near the surface of the water. Usually, the landmark is concealed by a circle of high weeds or marsh grass. The kappa uses this stump or rock as a sunning spot. Under the water, a large rock or pile of stones conceals the entrance to the actual lair, which opens into a tunnel that leads to a small, water-filled cavern. A hole in the cavern floor contains the kappa's treasure, which comprises coins, jewelry, and magical items taken from victims. The treasure hole is concealed by a large stone.</p><p>A kappa family consists of 2-6 adult males with an equal number of females. The number of children equals the total number of adults. Mating is initiated by the females, who vigorously pursue the male of their choice until the male submits. A female lays 1-6 eggs every year, about half of which actually hatch. The mother keeps the eggs hidden in her pouch, and carries the young in her pouch for up to a year after they hatch. A young kappa grows quickly, reaching full maturity in about five years. They can walk, swim, and speak as soon as they hatch, however. Kappa live to be about 100 years old.</p><p>These creatures are oblivious to the problems and concerns of others - even members of their own families. A kappa rarely will come to the aid of endangered kin unless he himself would benefit. Before he will act, his own safety must be reasonably assured and he must be fairly confident that his efforts will lead to personal gain - such as treasure or food.</p><p>Humans who share an area with a kappa learn to throw food and trinkets into his water as an offering. These humans write the names of their family members on the gifts, so the kappa is aware of their source. On rare occasions, a kappa acquires a deep respect for a particular human who is especially helpful, deferential, or threatening; in such cases, the kappa may offer to teach the human some of its skills.</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Ecology:</b> Kappa eat humans, cows, and sheep when they can get them; otherwise they content themselves with fish. They are especially fond of horseflesh, and often attempt to drag these animals to their doom. Kappa also enjoy cucumbers and melons.</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Kappa-Ti</b></p>  <p class=\"ni\">Kappa-ti are larger, faster, stronger versions of the common kappa. Their Strength is 19 (+4 to combat rolls) and they grow to a height of 5 feet. They lack a protective shell. Common kappa find them repulsive. Kappa-ti always are encountered alone or in mated pairs. Their natural camouflage gives them a 75% chance of avoiding detection in the wild.</p><p></p><p class=\"f\"><b>Vampiric Kappa</b></p>  <p class=\"ni\"><a href=\"/appendix/vampire\">Vampiric</a> kappa resemble common kappa in behavior, but they differ physically. Vampiric kappa are somewhat taller and weigh slightly more, and their eyes glow with a red fire. Their scales are tougher and more resilient. On dry land, the agile vampire is significantly faster. Vampiric kappa also tend to be more intelligent.</p><p>Vampiric kappa share the strength and cunning of common kappa, as well as their spellcasting abilities. In addition, vampiric kappa can make biting attacks. Once a successful bite has been scored, a vampiric kappa retains its grip, draining 1 point of Strength each round (but causing no further damage). This grip can be broken in three ways: by slaying the vampiric kappa, emptying its head-bowl, or making a successful &ldquo;bend bars/lift gates&rdquo; roll. If the victim's Strength reaches 0, he is slain.</p><p>Any victim of the kappa's bite has a 50% chance of contracting a debilitating disease. This disease causes the loss of 1-3 Strength points per day until cured, or until the victim dies. If the disease is cured - by <i>cure disease</i> or a similar spell, for example - the victim recovers 2-3 Strength points per day of rest.</p><p>Vampiric kappa seldom live in families with children. They dwell alone or with a mate. They prey on any living creatures they encounter, including other kappa.</p>\n","images":["<img src=\"grf/kt.gif\" width=\"150\" height=\"75\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Kara-Tur (Forgotten Realms)\" title=\"Kara-Tur (Forgotten Realms)\" align=\"right\">","<img src=\"img/kappa.gif\" alt=\"Kappa\" title=\"Kappa\" border=\"0\" width=\"300\" height=\"360\" style=\"text-align:right;\" align=\"right\">","<img src=\"grf/add2_01.gif\" width=\"200\" height=\"56\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Advanced Dungeons & Dragons 2nd Edition\">"],"setting":"Kara-Tur (Forgotten Realms)","statblock":{"Common Kappa":{"Activity Cycle":"Any","Alignment":"Chaotic evil","Armor Class":"3/-2","Climate/Terrain":"Tropical, subtropical, and temperate lakes and rivers","Damage/Attack":"5-10/5-10","Diet":"Carnivore","Frequency":"Rare","Hit Dice":"4","Intelligence":"Low to average (5-10)","Magic Resistance":"Nil","Morale":"Steady (11)","Movement":"6, Sw 18","No. Appearing":"1-6","No. of Attacks":"2","Organization":"Family","Size":"S (2' tall)","Special Attacks":"Nil","Special Defenses":"Regeneration","THAC0":"17","Treasure":"D","XP Value":"270"},"Kappa-Ti":{"Activity Cycle":"Any","Alignment":"Chaotic evil","Armor Class":"3","Climate/Terrain":"Tropical, subtropical, and temperate lakes and rivers","Damage/Attack":"10-20/10-20","Diet":"Carnivore","Frequency":"Very rare","Hit Dice":"8","Intelligence":"Low to average (5-10)","Magic Resistance":"Nil","Morale":"Steady (11)","Movement":"12, Sw 36","No. Appearing":"1","No. of Attacks":"2","Organization":"Solitary","Size":"M (4-5' tall)","Special Attacks":"Nil","Special Defenses":"Regeneration, camouflage","THAC0":"13","Treasure":"D","XP Value":"1,400"},"Vampiric Kappa":{"Activity Cycle":"Night","Alignment":"Chaotic evil","Armor Class":"0/-2","Climate/Terrain":"Tropical, subtropical, and temperate water","Damage/Attack":"5-10/5-10/1-6","Diet":"Carnivore","Frequency":"Very rare","Hit Dice":"7+7","Intelligence":"Average (8-10)","Magic Resistance":"Nil","Morale":"Steady (12)","Movement":"9, Sw 18","No. Appearing":"1-2","No. of Attacks":"3","Organization":"Solitary","Size":"S (3' tall)","Special Attacks":"Strength drain","Special Defenses":"Regeneration","THAC0":"13","Treasure":"D","XP Value":"2,000"}},"title":"Kappa"},"sources":["2116"],"statblock_names":[],"title":"Kappa","prev_key":"kankwild","next_key":"karliki","monster_path":"/appendix/kappa"}},"staticQueryHashes":[],"slicesMap":{}}
