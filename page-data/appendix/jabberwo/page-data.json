While the powers listed above are the most common, some aarakocra have different or additional powers.</p><p class=\"f\">A race of intelligent, birdlike creatures living in the deepest deserts of Athas, the rare Athasian <a href=\"/appendix/aarakocr\">aarakocra</a> spends its time soaring on thermals in search of food.</p><p>The aarakocra is 7 to 8 feet tall with a wingspan of 20 feet or more. Because of its large wingspan, an aarakocra can carry as much as 75% of its own body weight and still fly easily. An aarakocra can fly a short distance carrying a burden equaling 125% of its own body weight. The average body weight of a full grown male is 100 pounds and a female is 85 pounds.</p><p>Each wing has a &ldquo;hand&rdquo; at its midpoint, consisting of three fingers and an opposable thumb. The fourth finger forms the rigid leading edge of the wing. In flight the hands cannot be used, but on the ground the aarakocra can use its hands almost as a human would. The aarakocra's body is protected by a thin bony plate on the chest, much like a solid rib cage. Talons on its legs can be used as claws and can be retracted to reveal a second set of hands, also with three fingers and an opposable thumb. Except for the chest plate, the entire skeleton is hollow and extremely fragile.</p><p>From a distance, the Athasian aarakocra resembles a huge <a href=\"/appendix/bird\">vulture</a>. Its black eyes, set in the front of the head, provide excellent vision over a long range. The plumage is generally black with a white collar for adult males and black or brown with a smaller white collar for females. Adolescents are a mixture of brown and black. The beak is large and covers most of the head. Plumage begins at the crown of the head and is darker near the head, except for the collar. Athasian aarakocra speak their own language and the languages of vultures and other large birds. Some speak the common tongue (5% to 10% chance depending on how deep in the wastelands a tribe lives).</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Combat:</b> Aarakocra can fight in the air or on the ground. They prefer aerial combat since their bones are too fragile to withstand a solid blow from a human-sized opponent. In combat against creatures on the ground, they prefer to fly over their victim and drop weighted nets. Some aarakocra use darts to harass ground-based opponents.</p><p>If their opponents can fly, the aarakocra generally forgo the use of the net, although large groups sometimes use nets on flying creatures. Normally, aarakocra attack flying creatures with long spears, diving from above and allowing the momentum to carry the spear through the target. Such an attack doubles the damage if the aarakocra have been able to dive at least 50 feet. Only the very largest aarakocra can carry more than one of these spears, they can attack with both at once with no penalty, causing double damage on each strike. All diving attacks are made at +4 and should be treated as a charge attack. All other penalties and restrictions of charge attacks apply.</p><p>The effect of the aarakocra's nets depends on if the opponent is flying at the time it becomes entangled. Creatures on the ground that are hit by a net are entangled and unable to participate in any combat until they make a successful Strength check to get free of the net. Flying creatures hit by a net can no longer fly and immediately begin falling. If they cannot escape the net or use some magical means to arrest the fall, normal falling damage applies.</p><p>Unless victims are entangled in nets, aarakocra are cautious in ground combat. If the aarakocra outnumber their opponents they advance in a straight line and thrust with their spears. If outnumbered, or the opponents are particularly tough, the aarakocra withdraw. Victims entangled in nets are killed or incapacitated for use as food or ransom.</p><p>Athasian aarakocra are mindful of their physical limitations as well as their comparatively low psionic abilities. They do not normally initiate psionic combat. At the first sign of psionic powers from any of their victims, however, all aarakocra that have some ability will use whatever attack and defense modes they can in an attempt to destroy the threat. Large groups of is or more aarakocra may initiate psionic combat if their leaders feel they can win quickly and avoid physical combat.</p><p>In desperation, an aarakocra can attempt to bite an opponent in combat. Because of the unwieldiness of its beak, the aarakocra has a THAC0 of 18 if attacking with this appendage. Further, the birdman causes only 1d2 points of damage with the beak.</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Habitat/Society:</b> Athasian aarakocra live in tribes with 6-20 (2d8+4) members, depending on the prestige of the leader. The largest tribe ever recorded had 50 members. The tribal hunting territory depends on the size of the tribe, usually about 500 square miles for a tribe of 10 members. There are no rigid boundaries between tribes and border disputes are not uncommon.</p><p>Alignments of tribe members are similar to the alignment of the leader. A tribe that has a leader who is neutral good may have neutral good, chaotic good, lawful good, and true neutral members. A predominantly evil tribe does not recognize boundaries with other tribes and treats other tribes as inferior beings to be eliminated.</p><p>Athasian aarakocra aren't happy in enclosed spaces, but they they take refuge in a cave or building if necessary.</p><p>Nonevil tribes live in rocky aeries in the highest peaks they can find. Evil tribes are normally nomadic and use an aerie made by another tribe if they need to remain in an area for a long time, even if they have to evict the tribe that made the nest.</p><p>Aarakocra aren't friendly toward intruders in their territory, especially caravans. They try to extract a toll from the caravan for passage through the desert. Good-aligned tribes allow unhindered passage of caravans that pay a tribute. If someone refuses to pay the tribute, the aarakocra try to capture scouts or outriders from the party and hold them until an even larger tribute is paid. The payment may be either livestock or shiny objects. Aarakocra are smart enough not to be taken in by glass baubles instead of gems, although they cannot tell the difference between the more common gems and the rare ones.</p><p>Evil tribes ask for tribute and often attack a caravan whether it pays or not. Aarakocra always demand shiny objects such as stones. These tribes find humans and demihumans to be quite tasty and prefer them to other food.</p><p>Good-aligned tribes of aarakocra sometimes return a lost traveler to the edge of the desert after first removing any valuables the traveler may be carrying. On very rare occasions a tribe might return a lost group of travelers to the more frequently traveled parts of the desert, again after first taking any valuables as payment.</p><p>The oldest male is the leader of the tribal hunting party and has 4+4 Hit Dice. The oldest female is in charge of the tribal aerie and has 3+3 HD. In tribes that have more than 15 members, the next oldest aarakocra serves as shaman and has 3+3 HD; the shaman completes the triumvirate necessary for proper worship and the summoning of elementals. (Interestingly, no magic-using aarakocra has ever been recorded.) Tribes without a shaman cannot summon <a href=\"/appendix/element1\">air elementals</a>, which is an important part of aarakocra culture.</p><p>The shaman is the leader of the daily sun worship. Aarakocra worship the sun because it provides them with the thermals they need to soar in search of food. The shaman also leads the mystic rituals used to summon an air elemental. Summoning an air elemental is usually done only in preparation for the tribe's most sacred ceremony, the hunt. Small tribes must band together for this ceremony to allow the triumvirate to be formed.</p><p>The ceremony to summon an air elemental must be conducted at dawn and requires the oldest male and female to emit a highpitched keening whistle. The shaman conducts an intricate dance around them, simultaneously chanting an ancient summoning mantra.</p><p>The hunt is the final part of the initiation of adolescent aarakocra to adulthood and often takes the tribe far from their normal teritory. The target is always a <a href=\"/appendix/drakalsi\">silt drake</a>. The hunt is the only time the females leave the relative safety of the nest. Even an evil tribe will not interfere with a tribe on a hunt. An air elemental is often summoned to help find the drake, but never takes part in the actual combat. Although the adult members of the tribe take part in the initial phases of the combat, it is the initiates who deliver the final, killing blows to me drake. Scars from the hunt are considered a mark of pride among all aarakocra.</p><p>The females spend about eight months of the year incubating their eggs. Athasian aarakocra mate for life and a pair normally produces as many as 10 offspring. A female lays one egg a year. Constant incubation is not required because of the high daytime temperatures, so the females can maintain the nest and keep the tribe's treasure in order.</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Ecology:</b> Athasian aarakocra are high on the food chain and have no natural enemies other than <a href=\"/appendix/drakatha\">drakes</a>. Unless evil, aarakocra leave their own territory only to hunt the silt drake and return as soon as possible when the hunt is over. (Evil aarakocra attack others, as noted above.) Aarakocra eggs and hatchlings are sought after by wealthy land owners who wish to use the creatures as scouts and sentries. An egg can bring as much as 10 cp in Tyr's marketplace. Tribes that have had eggs or hatchlings stolen have long memories and sometimes take revenge against the thief at a later date. Captive aarakocra join any tribe they come in contact with.</p><p>Athasian aarakocra have a natural life span of 21-30 years.</p>\n","images":["<img src=\"grf/ds.gif\" width=\"150\" height=\"75\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Dark Sun\" title=\"Dark Sun\" align=\"right\">","<img src=\"img/aarakath.gif\" alt=\"Aarakocra (Athas)\" title=\"Aarakocra (Athas)\" border=\"0\" width=\"300\" height=\"360\" style=\"text-align:right;\" align=\"right\">","<img src=\"grf/add2_01.gif\" width=\"200\" height=\"56\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Advanced Dungeons & Dragons 2nd Edition\">"],"setting":"Dark Sun","statblock":{"Aarakocra (Athas)":{"Activity Cycle":"Day","Alignment":"Any","Armor Class":"7","Climate/Terrain":"Deep desert","Damage/Attack":"1d3/1d3 or by weapon","Diet":"Carnivore","Frequency":"Rare","Hit Dice":"2+2","Intelligence":"Average (8-10)","Magic Resistance":"Nil","Morale":"Steady (11)","Movement":"6, Fl 36 (C)","No. Appearing":"1d10","No. of Attacks":"2","Organization":"Tribal","Size":"M (20'+ wingspan)","Special Attacks":"Nil","Special Defenses":"Nil","THAC0":"17","Treasure":"Varies","XP Value":"65"}},"title":"Aarakocra (Athas)"},"sources":["2433"],"statblock_names":[],"title":"Aarakocra (Athas)","prev_key":"zygraat","next_key":"aarakocr","monster_path":"/appendix/aarakath"}}},"pageContext":{"monster_key":"jabberwo","monster_data":{"TSR":["2166"],"fullBody":"  <table cellspacing=\"0\" cellpadding=\"0\"><tr><th>Climate/Terrain:</th><td>Forest</td></tr><tr><th>Frequency:</th><td>Unique?</td></tr><tr><th>Organization:</th><td>Solitary</td></tr><tr><th>Activity Cycle:</th><td>Any</td></tr><tr><th>Diet:</th><td>Carnivore</td></tr><tr><th>Intelligence:</th><td>Semi- (4)</td></tr><tr><th>Treasure:</th><td>Incidental</td></tr><tr><th>Alignment:</th><td>Neutral</td></tr><tr><th>No. Appearing:</th><td>1</td></tr><tr><th>Armor Class:</th><td>-10</td></tr><tr><th>Movement:</th><td>15, fly 15 (C)</td></tr><tr><th>Hit Dice:</th><td>15 (99 hp)</td></tr><tr><th>THAC0:</th><td>5</td></tr><tr><th>No. of Attacks:</th><td>1</td></tr><tr><th>Damage/Attack:</th><td>3d10</td></tr><tr><th>Special Attacks:</th><td><i>Burble</i>, eyebeams, fear aura, grasp, flurry attack</td></tr><tr><th>Special Defenses:</th><td>Immune to non-vorpal weapons</td></tr><tr><th>Magic Resistance:</th><td>80%</td></tr><tr><th>Size:</th><td>G (30' body, 25' tail)</td></tr><tr><th>Morale:</th><td>Fearless (20)</td></tr><tr><th>XP Value:</th><td>25,000</td></tr></table><p class=\"f\">The jabberwock is a curious creature found only in dense, virgin forests. In appearance it resembles a <a href=\"/appendix/dragon\">dragon</a> in its general outlines but lacks a breath weapon or any treasure-hoarding instinct. It is, however, fiercely territorial and attempts to slay and devour any intruders it finds prowling about in its woods.</p><p>Due to the creature's <i>burble</i> attack (described below), accurate descriptions of the jabberwock are difficult to come by, as dazed survivors often retain only a confused impression of parts and not the whole. However, the sage Ludovicus Humphrey made a careful study of the beast before his untimely demise on a recent research trip and reported that it has a stout draconian torso with sturdy hind legs, long forearms each ending in four feathery talons (each talon being some four feet long and fully prehensile), a long sinus neck ending in an enormons head, a pair of elegant wings, and a long thin tail. The creature can rear up on its hind legs and actually take a few steps in biped fashion if the need occurs (say, to retrieve a quarry who has climbed a tree), beating its wings for balance. It can fly but rarely does, as it prefers to keep to the shelter of the trees. The baleful yellow eyes have red pupils and actually emit beams of light &ndash; said to be an unnerving sight when spotted approaching in a dark forest. Moss fills the tiny cracks between its scales, and it's possible that the <q>feathery</q> appendages hanging from its claws are actually parasitic growths similar to Spanish moss. The scales themselves are tawny, the color of tarnished gold (if gold could tarnish), darkening to brown at the extremities (the wings and claws).</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Combat:</b> Combat: The jabberwock is a fearsome opponent, more for its relentlessness pursuit of a target than any other factor. Once a jabberwock has chosen a target, it concentrates all its attacks on him or her (or it) until the victim is killed (and devoured), until the jabberwock itself is slain (a very unlikely event), or until the target escapes via <i>teleportation</i> or some similar means. Note that like true dragons the jabberwock has exceptionally keen senses and can detect <i>invisible</i> or hidden opponents; so long as the chosen target remains within its forest, the jabberwock will pursue it.</p><p>The jabberwock's preferred method of attack is a straightforward bite with its huge front teeth; its snaky neck enables its head to dart out and attack targets a surprising distance away.</p><p>However, it has several special attacks which make its task easier and the victim's life harder (and, often, shorter). First, it constantly mutters or burbles to itself &ndash; a low, rumbling bubbling sound that carries up to 200 feet. Anyone who hears this sound must make a saving throw vs. spell at a 4 penalty or become <i>confused</i>. A jabberwock's <i>confusion</i> is more potent than the wizard spell of the same name, lasting as long as the victim is within range and able to hear the noise; in addition, it distorts perception, causing hallucinations and strangely skewed judgment of distance: objects, or parts of objects, may appear much closer or further away than they actually are (this translates into a -3 penalty on the attack roll of anyone suffering from this confused warping of depth perception). A curious side effect of the <i>burble</i> is that it acts as a sort of <i>babble</i> spell (a reversed <i>tongues</i>): the victim's words slide, shift, and blend, producing odd hvbrids that make comunication very difiicult.</p><p>In addition to its burble. the jabberwock also has several other special attacks. Its eyebeams act as the rays from a <i>wand of paralysis</i>, freezing in place any target who fails a saving throw vs. paralyzation. The jabberwock also shares the fear aura of true dragons. While its normal attack is a simple bite with its enormous incisors, it can also grasp prey in its great talons, holding a man-sized creature helplessly immobilized in either forepaw (it then gains a +2 bonus to bite a target so restrained &ndash; +4 if the victim is held by both forepaws). If seriously inconvenienced (that is, if attacked by a large party of well-armed and well-coordinated adventurers), it will go into a flurry of activity, striking out in all directions like a hurricane with swipes of its forepaw claws (1d10/1d10), wing buffets (2d10/2d10), hind leg stomps (2d6/2d6), bite (3d10), and tail lash (2d8). Each of these attacks is at a -2 penalty on the creature's attack roll; those struck must make a saving throw vs. paralysis or be knocked down or driven back (50% chance of either), enabling the jabberwock to refocus its attack.</p><p>The only effectove means of attacking a jabberwock is with a vorpal weapon; its extremely tough scales repel all other blows (all non-vorpal weapons inflict only nonlethal subdual damage). Even its eyes &ndash; traditionally a vulnerable spot in armored creatures &ndash; are protected by tough semitransparent inner eyelids. Its superior magic resistance prevents most spells from being effective as well.</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Habitat/Society:</b> The jabbemock is a solitary creature that apparently treats all other beings it meets as prey. The only exceptions to this rule are druids, which the jabberwock ignores, and sylvan creatures such as <a href=\"/appendix/dryad\">dryads</a>, <a href=\"/appendix/treant\">treants</a>, forest <a href=\"/appendix/gnome\">gnomes</a>, and the like, who can sense its approach and discreetly withdraw in order to avoid a confrontation. It is generally believed that, like the <a href=\"/appendix/tarrasqu\">tarrasque</a> or <a href=\"/appendix/phoenix\">phoenix</a>, only one jabberwock exists at any one time; certainly only one will be encountered in any one forest.</p><p>The sage Ludovicus Humphrey maintained that the jabberwock was created by the forest itself as a sort of <i>genius loci</i>, a manifestation of the woodland designed to protect it from intruders. In theory, then, more than one jabberwock could exist, each in its own primal forest, although no duplication has ever been recorded. It must be a large and ancient forest to manifest a jabberwock, which then acts as a sort of antibody to repel or destroy interlopers. Should the jabberwock be destroyed, it will reappear within a generation, either in the same forest (unless it has been too badly damaged in the interim by logging or settlement) or in a far-distant one. No immature jabberwock has ever been sighted, and the creature does not appear to age, although there are some indications that it continues to grow throughout its long life.</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Ecology:</b> Despite its unwavering ferocity, the jabberwock serves a very important function for the forest it inhabits. In essence, it is the woods' protector, its very presence serving to keep away most of those who would exploit or destroy the woodlands. It is doubtful that the jabberwock is aware of, or cares about, the purpose for which it was created; it simply fulfills that function by its sheer efficiency as a predator.</p><div style=\"text-align:center\";><h3 style=\"color:#4169e1;\">Jabberwocky</h3><p class=\"f\"><i>Twas briflig, and the slithy toves<br>Did gyre and gimble in the wabe:<br>All mimsy were the borogoves,<br>And the mome raths outgrabe.</i></p><p class=\"f\">&ldquo;Beware the Jabberwock, my son!<br>The jaws that bite, the claws that catch!<br>Beware the Jubjub bird, and shun<br>The frumious Bandersnatch!&rdquo;</p><p class=\"f\">He took his vorpal sword in hand<br>Long time the mansome foe he sought &mdash;<br>He rested he by the Tumtum tree,<br>And stood awhile in thought.</p><p class=\"f\">And, as in uffish thought he stood,<br>The Jabberwock, with eyes of flame,<br>Came whiffling through the tulgey wood,<br>And burbled as it came!</p><p class=\"f\">One, two!
