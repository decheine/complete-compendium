While the powers listed above are the most common, some aarakocra have different or additional powers.</p><p class=\"f\">A race of intelligent, birdlike creatures living in the deepest deserts of Athas, the rare Athasian <a href=\"/appendix/aarakocr\">aarakocra</a> spends its time soaring on thermals in search of food.</p><p>The aarakocra is 7 to 8 feet tall with a wingspan of 20 feet or more. Because of its large wingspan, an aarakocra can carry as much as 75% of its own body weight and still fly easily. An aarakocra can fly a short distance carrying a burden equaling 125% of its own body weight. The average body weight of a full grown male is 100 pounds and a female is 85 pounds.</p><p>Each wing has a &ldquo;hand&rdquo; at its midpoint, consisting of three fingers and an opposable thumb. The fourth finger forms the rigid leading edge of the wing. In flight the hands cannot be used, but on the ground the aarakocra can use its hands almost as a human would. The aarakocra's body is protected by a thin bony plate on the chest, much like a solid rib cage. Talons on its legs can be used as claws and can be retracted to reveal a second set of hands, also with three fingers and an opposable thumb. Except for the chest plate, the entire skeleton is hollow and extremely fragile.</p><p>From a distance, the Athasian aarakocra resembles a huge <a href=\"/appendix/bird\">vulture</a>. Its black eyes, set in the front of the head, provide excellent vision over a long range. The plumage is generally black with a white collar for adult males and black or brown with a smaller white collar for females. Adolescents are a mixture of brown and black. The beak is large and covers most of the head. Plumage begins at the crown of the head and is darker near the head, except for the collar. Athasian aarakocra speak their own language and the languages of vultures and other large birds. Some speak the common tongue (5% to 10% chance depending on how deep in the wastelands a tribe lives).</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Combat:</b> Aarakocra can fight in the air or on the ground. They prefer aerial combat since their bones are too fragile to withstand a solid blow from a human-sized opponent. In combat against creatures on the ground, they prefer to fly over their victim and drop weighted nets. Some aarakocra use darts to harass ground-based opponents.</p><p>If their opponents can fly, the aarakocra generally forgo the use of the net, although large groups sometimes use nets on flying creatures. Normally, aarakocra attack flying creatures with long spears, diving from above and allowing the momentum to carry the spear through the target. Such an attack doubles the damage if the aarakocra have been able to dive at least 50 feet. Only the very largest aarakocra can carry more than one of these spears, they can attack with both at once with no penalty, causing double damage on each strike. All diving attacks are made at +4 and should be treated as a charge attack. All other penalties and restrictions of charge attacks apply.</p><p>The effect of the aarakocra's nets depends on if the opponent is flying at the time it becomes entangled. Creatures on the ground that are hit by a net are entangled and unable to participate in any combat until they make a successful Strength check to get free of the net. Flying creatures hit by a net can no longer fly and immediately begin falling. If they cannot escape the net or use some magical means to arrest the fall, normal falling damage applies.</p><p>Unless victims are entangled in nets, aarakocra are cautious in ground combat. If the aarakocra outnumber their opponents they advance in a straight line and thrust with their spears. If outnumbered, or the opponents are particularly tough, the aarakocra withdraw. Victims entangled in nets are killed or incapacitated for use as food or ransom.</p><p>Athasian aarakocra are mindful of their physical limitations as well as their comparatively low psionic abilities. They do not normally initiate psionic combat. At the first sign of psionic powers from any of their victims, however, all aarakocra that have some ability will use whatever attack and defense modes they can in an attempt to destroy the threat. Large groups of is or more aarakocra may initiate psionic combat if their leaders feel they can win quickly and avoid physical combat.</p><p>In desperation, an aarakocra can attempt to bite an opponent in combat. Because of the unwieldiness of its beak, the aarakocra has a THAC0 of 18 if attacking with this appendage. Further, the birdman causes only 1d2 points of damage with the beak.</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Habitat/Society:</b> Athasian aarakocra live in tribes with 6-20 (2d8+4) members, depending on the prestige of the leader. The largest tribe ever recorded had 50 members. The tribal hunting territory depends on the size of the tribe, usually about 500 square miles for a tribe of 10 members. There are no rigid boundaries between tribes and border disputes are not uncommon.</p><p>Alignments of tribe members are similar to the alignment of the leader. A tribe that has a leader who is neutral good may have neutral good, chaotic good, lawful good, and true neutral members. A predominantly evil tribe does not recognize boundaries with other tribes and treats other tribes as inferior beings to be eliminated.</p><p>Athasian aarakocra aren't happy in enclosed spaces, but they they take refuge in a cave or building if necessary.</p><p>Nonevil tribes live in rocky aeries in the highest peaks they can find. Evil tribes are normally nomadic and use an aerie made by another tribe if they need to remain in an area for a long time, even if they have to evict the tribe that made the nest.</p><p>Aarakocra aren't friendly toward intruders in their territory, especially caravans. They try to extract a toll from the caravan for passage through the desert. Good-aligned tribes allow unhindered passage of caravans that pay a tribute. If someone refuses to pay the tribute, the aarakocra try to capture scouts or outriders from the party and hold them until an even larger tribute is paid. The payment may be either livestock or shiny objects. Aarakocra are smart enough not to be taken in by glass baubles instead of gems, although they cannot tell the difference between the more common gems and the rare ones.</p><p>Evil tribes ask for tribute and often attack a caravan whether it pays or not. Aarakocra always demand shiny objects such as stones. These tribes find humans and demihumans to be quite tasty and prefer them to other food.</p><p>Good-aligned tribes of aarakocra sometimes return a lost traveler to the edge of the desert after first removing any valuables the traveler may be carrying. On very rare occasions a tribe might return a lost group of travelers to the more frequently traveled parts of the desert, again after first taking any valuables as payment.</p><p>The oldest male is the leader of the tribal hunting party and has 4+4 Hit Dice. The oldest female is in charge of the tribal aerie and has 3+3 HD. In tribes that have more than 15 members, the next oldest aarakocra serves as shaman and has 3+3 HD; the shaman completes the triumvirate necessary for proper worship and the summoning of elementals. (Interestingly, no magic-using aarakocra has ever been recorded.) Tribes without a shaman cannot summon <a href=\"/appendix/element1\">air elementals</a>, which is an important part of aarakocra culture.</p><p>The shaman is the leader of the daily sun worship. Aarakocra worship the sun because it provides them with the thermals they need to soar in search of food. The shaman also leads the mystic rituals used to summon an air elemental. Summoning an air elemental is usually done only in preparation for the tribe's most sacred ceremony, the hunt. Small tribes must band together for this ceremony to allow the triumvirate to be formed.</p><p>The ceremony to summon an air elemental must be conducted at dawn and requires the oldest male and female to emit a highpitched keening whistle. The shaman conducts an intricate dance around them, simultaneously chanting an ancient summoning mantra.</p><p>The hunt is the final part of the initiation of adolescent aarakocra to adulthood and often takes the tribe far from their normal teritory. The target is always a <a href=\"/appendix/drakalsi\">silt drake</a>. The hunt is the only time the females leave the relative safety of the nest. Even an evil tribe will not interfere with a tribe on a hunt. An air elemental is often summoned to help find the drake, but never takes part in the actual combat. Although the adult members of the tribe take part in the initial phases of the combat, it is the initiates who deliver the final, killing blows to me drake. Scars from the hunt are considered a mark of pride among all aarakocra.</p><p>The females spend about eight months of the year incubating their eggs. Athasian aarakocra mate for life and a pair normally produces as many as 10 offspring. A female lays one egg a year. Constant incubation is not required because of the high daytime temperatures, so the females can maintain the nest and keep the tribe's treasure in order.</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Ecology:</b> Athasian aarakocra are high on the food chain and have no natural enemies other than <a href=\"/appendix/drakatha\">drakes</a>. Unless evil, aarakocra leave their own territory only to hunt the silt drake and return as soon as possible when the hunt is over. (Evil aarakocra attack others, as noted above.) Aarakocra eggs and hatchlings are sought after by wealthy land owners who wish to use the creatures as scouts and sentries. An egg can bring as much as 10 cp in Tyr's marketplace. Tribes that have had eggs or hatchlings stolen have long memories and sometimes take revenge against the thief at a later date. Captive aarakocra join any tribe they come in contact with.</p><p>Athasian aarakocra have a natural life span of 21-30 years.</p><p></p><br clear=\"all\" style=\"clear:both; height:0;\">\r\n","images":["<img src=\"grf/ds.gif\" width=\"150\" height=\"75\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Dark Sun\" title=\"Dark Sun\" align=\"right\">","<img src=\"img/aarakath.gif\" alt=\"Aarakocra (Athas)\" title=\"Aarakocra (Athas)\" border=\"0\" width=\"300\" height=\"360\" style=\"text-align:right;\" align=\"right\">","<img src=\"grf/add2_01.gif\" width=\"200\" height=\"56\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Advanced Dungeons & Dragons 2nd Edition\">"],"setting":"Dark Sun","statblock":{"Aarakocra (Athas)":{"Activity Cycle":"Day","Alignment":"Any","Armor Class":"7","Climate/Terrain":"Deep desert","Damage/Attack":"1d3/1d3 or by weapon","Diet":"Carnivore","Frequency":"Rare","Hit Dice":"2+2","Intelligence":"Average (8-10)","Magic Resistance":"Nil","Morale":"Steady (11)","Movement":"6, Fl 36 (C)","No. Appearing":"1d10","No. of Attacks":"2","Organization":"Tribal","Size":"M (20'+ wingspan)","Special Attacks":"Nil","Special Defenses":"Nil","THAC0":"17","Treasure":"Varies","XP Value":"65"}},"title":"Aarakocra (Athas)"},"sources":["2433"],"statblock_names":[],"title":"Aarakocra (Athas)","prev_key":"zygraat","next_key":"aarakocr","monster_path":"/appendix/aarakath"}}},"pageContext":{"monster_key":"volt","monster_data":{"TSR":["2132"],"fullBody":"  <table cellspacing=\"0\" cellpadding=\"0\"><tr><th>Climate/Terrain:</th><td>Tropical or temperate land</td></tr><tr><th>Frequency:</th><td>Uncommon</td></tr><tr><th>Organization:</th><td>Herd</td></tr><tr><th>Activity Cycle:</th><td>Any</td></tr><tr><th>Diet:</th><td>Electricity and blood</td></tr><tr><th>Intelligence:</th><td>Animal (1)</td></tr><tr><th>Treasure:</th><td>Nil</td></tr><tr><th>Alignment:</th><td>Neutral</td></tr><tr><th>No. Appearing:</th><td>2-24</td></tr><tr><th>Armor Class:</th><td>3</td></tr><tr><th>Movement:</th><td>Fl 6 (D)</td></tr><tr><th>Hit Dice:</th><td>2+1</td></tr><tr><th>THAC0:</th><td>19</td></tr><tr><th>No. of Attacks:</th><td>1</td></tr><tr><th>Damage/Attack:</th><td>1-4</td></tr><tr><th>Special Attacks:</th><td>Electrified tail stinger, blood drain</td></tr><tr><th>Special Defenses:</th><td>Immune to electrical attacks</td></tr><tr><th>Magic Resistance:</th><td>Nil</td></tr><tr><th>Size:</th><td>S (about 2' diameter)</td></tr><tr><th>Morale:</th><td>Steady (11)</td></tr><tr><th>XP Value:</th><td>420</td></tr></table><p class=\"f\">Volts are curious little creatures, but bad-tempered and dangerous. These spherical animals hunt by sensing the electrical impulses of their prey. Volts are often found in or around areas of violent thunderstorm activity. Volts appear as nearly-spherical bundles of bristly grey hair. They see with two huge bulbous eyes on the top of their slightly-flattened bodies. They also possess two small curved horns just above their mouths. These mouths resemble suckers, and are full of tiny teeth, like the mouth of an <a href=\"/appendix/eel\">eel</a>. A 3' long, naked tail provides for balance while in flight. At the business end of the tail is a barbed stinger and an electricity-producing organ. Volts are surrounded by a faint blue electrical aura which is only visible in low-light conditions (torchlight, moonlight, or complete darkness) Furthermore, their bodies give off a curious, low humming sound, which can only be heard under the quietest of conditions. It has also been reported that small arcs of electricity snap and sizzle their way through the hairs of some individuals (5% chance).</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Combat:</b> Volts locate prey by detecting electrical impulses, such as nerve activity. Creatures with more complex nervous systems are attacked first, while creatures with less active nerve impulses (i.e., plant forms) or none at all (i.e., <a href=\"/appendix/golem\">golems</a>) are ignored.</p><p>To attack, the volt first propels itself toward the intended victim and attempts to bite its neck, or other readily reachable body surface, for 1-4 points of damage. A succesful bite indicates that the volt has firmly attached itself to the victim's neck and cannot be detached until the victim or the volt is dead. Suction tendrils then snake out from the volt's mouth, so that it may drain blood from the victim for an addition 1-4 points of damage per round that it is attached.</p><p>Once attached, the volt will also lash out with its electrically-charged tail stinger, which hits automatically. A hit by the stinger results in 2-12 additional points of damage. A small percentage of the volt population (5%) may feed on the victim's nervous energy instead of blood. In this case, the mouth tendrils inflict 2-16 points of damage per round. After the volt is detached, this damage is recovered at a rate of 1 point per turn.</p><p>Volts tend to be rather touchy creatures, and will often attack any or all creatures present for no apparent reason.</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Habitat/Society:</b> Volts float by employing magic similar to that of a <i>levitation</i> spell. Mobility is provided by rapidly twitching the long tail, similar to the way in which a <a href=\"/appendix/snake\">snake</a> swims. Volts are rather slow and clumsy, moving at a rate of 6, and with maneuverability class D. They may be found close to the ground if hunting, or high in the air if thunderstorms are near.</p><p>Volts are drawn towards lightning sources (thunderstorms, <i>lightning bolt</i> spells, etc.) and tend to be more aggressive around such electrical discharges. During these times, but no more than once per year, they may reproduce by a sudden bright discharge of electrical energy. After 2 rounds, the crackling discharge coalesces into an immature volt. These immature volts (sometimes referred to as microvolts) stay near the lightning source, for they will become mature adults only if struck by lightning. Immature volts can survive for no more than 6 hours, and if not struck by lightning during that time, they will wither and die.</p><p>Lightning also mends 2-8 points of damage suffered by adult volts, while lesser electrical discharges such as the <i>shocking grasp</i> spell do not affect them. Volts drink blood so that they may extract substances from it (mostly salt) to charge their electrical organs.</p><p>Volt herds are led by a single creature who has been able to drain the blood (and thus the power) of other competing creatures of the same herd. The leader has 3 Hit Dice and AC 2, but is otherwise identical to other volts. The herd does not stay in or defend any particular territory, but rather follows weather fronts which have the promise of thunderstorm activity. The herds are most often found wherever and whenever thunderstorm activity is at a peak.</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Ecology:</b> Sages are unsure of the exact role of volts in the lands where they dwell. It is suspected that the electrical aura which surrounds them at all times helps to initiate thunderstorms. If the electrical organ is properly harvested from a dead volt, it can be useful in the creation of a <i>wand of lightning</i>.</p><p></p><br clear=\"all\" style=\"clear:both; height:0;\">\r\n","images":["<img src=\"grf/ff.gif\" width=\"150\" height=\"75\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Fiends Folio\" title=\"Fiends Folio\" align=\"right\">","<img src=\"img/volt.gif\" alt=\"Volt\" title=\"Volt\" border=\"0\" width=\"300\" height=\"360\" style=\"text-align:right;\" align=\"right\">","<img src=\"grf/add2_01.gif\" width=\"200\" height=\"56\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Advanced Dungeons & Dragons 2nd Edition\">"],"setting":"Fiends Folio","statblock":{"Volt":{"Activity Cycle":"Any","Alignment":"Neutral","Armor Class":"3","Climate/Terrain":"Tropical or temperate land","Damage/Attack":"1-4","Diet":"Electricity and blood","Frequency":"Uncommon","Hit Dice":"2+1","Intelligence":"Animal (1)","Magic Resistance":"Nil","Morale":"Steady (11)","Movement":"Fl 6 (D)","No. Appearing":"2-24","No. of Attacks":"1","Organization":"Herd","Size":"S (about 2' diameter)","Special Attacks":"Electrified tail stinger, blood drain","Special Defenses":"Immune to electrical attacks","THAC0":"19","Treasure":"Nil","XP Value":"420"}},"title":"Volt"},"sources":["2132"],"statblock_names":[],"title":"Volt","prev_key":"vodonien","next_key":"voorlarv","monster_path":"/appendix/volt"}},"staticQueryHashes":[],"slicesMap":{}}
