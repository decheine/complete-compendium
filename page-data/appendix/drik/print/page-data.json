While the powers listed above are the most common, some aarakocra have different or additional powers.</p><p class=\"f\">A race of intelligent, birdlike creatures living in the deepest deserts of Athas, the rare Athasian <a href=\"/appendix/aarakocr\">aarakocra</a> spends its time soaring on thermals in search of food.</p><p>The aarakocra is 7 to 8 feet tall with a wingspan of 20 feet or more. Because of its large wingspan, an aarakocra can carry as much as 75% of its own body weight and still fly easily. An aarakocra can fly a short distance carrying a burden equaling 125% of its own body weight. The average body weight of a full grown male is 100 pounds and a female is 85 pounds.</p><p>Each wing has a &ldquo;hand&rdquo; at its midpoint, consisting of three fingers and an opposable thumb. The fourth finger forms the rigid leading edge of the wing. In flight the hands cannot be used, but on the ground the aarakocra can use its hands almost as a human would. The aarakocra's body is protected by a thin bony plate on the chest, much like a solid rib cage. Talons on its legs can be used as claws and can be retracted to reveal a second set of hands, also with three fingers and an opposable thumb. Except for the chest plate, the entire skeleton is hollow and extremely fragile.</p><p>From a distance, the Athasian aarakocra resembles a huge <a href=\"/appendix/bird\">vulture</a>. Its black eyes, set in the front of the head, provide excellent vision over a long range. The plumage is generally black with a white collar for adult males and black or brown with a smaller white collar for females. Adolescents are a mixture of brown and black. The beak is large and covers most of the head. Plumage begins at the crown of the head and is darker near the head, except for the collar. Athasian aarakocra speak their own language and the languages of vultures and other large birds. Some speak the common tongue (5% to 10% chance depending on how deep in the wastelands a tribe lives).</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Combat:</b> Aarakocra can fight in the air or on the ground. They prefer aerial combat since their bones are too fragile to withstand a solid blow from a human-sized opponent. In combat against creatures on the ground, they prefer to fly over their victim and drop weighted nets. Some aarakocra use darts to harass ground-based opponents.</p><p>If their opponents can fly, the aarakocra generally forgo the use of the net, although large groups sometimes use nets on flying creatures. Normally, aarakocra attack flying creatures with long spears, diving from above and allowing the momentum to carry the spear through the target. Such an attack doubles the damage if the aarakocra have been able to dive at least 50 feet. Only the very largest aarakocra can carry more than one of these spears, they can attack with both at once with no penalty, causing double damage on each strike. All diving attacks are made at +4 and should be treated as a charge attack. All other penalties and restrictions of charge attacks apply.</p><p>The effect of the aarakocra's nets depends on if the opponent is flying at the time it becomes entangled. Creatures on the ground that are hit by a net are entangled and unable to participate in any combat until they make a successful Strength check to get free of the net. Flying creatures hit by a net can no longer fly and immediately begin falling. If they cannot escape the net or use some magical means to arrest the fall, normal falling damage applies.</p><p>Unless victims are entangled in nets, aarakocra are cautious in ground combat. If the aarakocra outnumber their opponents they advance in a straight line and thrust with their spears. If outnumbered, or the opponents are particularly tough, the aarakocra withdraw. Victims entangled in nets are killed or incapacitated for use as food or ransom.</p><p>Athasian aarakocra are mindful of their physical limitations as well as their comparatively low psionic abilities. They do not normally initiate psionic combat. At the first sign of psionic powers from any of their victims, however, all aarakocra that have some ability will use whatever attack and defense modes they can in an attempt to destroy the threat. Large groups of is or more aarakocra may initiate psionic combat if their leaders feel they can win quickly and avoid physical combat.</p><p>In desperation, an aarakocra can attempt to bite an opponent in combat. Because of the unwieldiness of its beak, the aarakocra has a THAC0 of 18 if attacking with this appendage. Further, the birdman causes only 1d2 points of damage with the beak.</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Habitat/Society:</b> Athasian aarakocra live in tribes with 6-20 (2d8+4) members, depending on the prestige of the leader. The largest tribe ever recorded had 50 members. The tribal hunting territory depends on the size of the tribe, usually about 500 square miles for a tribe of 10 members. There are no rigid boundaries between tribes and border disputes are not uncommon.</p><p>Alignments of tribe members are similar to the alignment of the leader. A tribe that has a leader who is neutral good may have neutral good, chaotic good, lawful good, and true neutral members. A predominantly evil tribe does not recognize boundaries with other tribes and treats other tribes as inferior beings to be eliminated.</p><p>Athasian aarakocra aren't happy in enclosed spaces, but they they take refuge in a cave or building if necessary.</p><p>Nonevil tribes live in rocky aeries in the highest peaks they can find. Evil tribes are normally nomadic and use an aerie made by another tribe if they need to remain in an area for a long time, even if they have to evict the tribe that made the nest.</p><p>Aarakocra aren't friendly toward intruders in their territory, especially caravans. They try to extract a toll from the caravan for passage through the desert. Good-aligned tribes allow unhindered passage of caravans that pay a tribute. If someone refuses to pay the tribute, the aarakocra try to capture scouts or outriders from the party and hold them until an even larger tribute is paid. The payment may be either livestock or shiny objects. Aarakocra are smart enough not to be taken in by glass baubles instead of gems, although they cannot tell the difference between the more common gems and the rare ones.</p><p>Evil tribes ask for tribute and often attack a caravan whether it pays or not. Aarakocra always demand shiny objects such as stones. These tribes find humans and demihumans to be quite tasty and prefer them to other food.</p><p>Good-aligned tribes of aarakocra sometimes return a lost traveler to the edge of the desert after first removing any valuables the traveler may be carrying. On very rare occasions a tribe might return a lost group of travelers to the more frequently traveled parts of the desert, again after first taking any valuables as payment.</p><p>The oldest male is the leader of the tribal hunting party and has 4+4 Hit Dice. The oldest female is in charge of the tribal aerie and has 3+3 HD. In tribes that have more than 15 members, the next oldest aarakocra serves as shaman and has 3+3 HD; the shaman completes the triumvirate necessary for proper worship and the summoning of elementals. (Interestingly, no magic-using aarakocra has ever been recorded.) Tribes without a shaman cannot summon <a href=\"/appendix/element1\">air elementals</a>, which is an important part of aarakocra culture.</p><p>The shaman is the leader of the daily sun worship. Aarakocra worship the sun because it provides them with the thermals they need to soar in search of food. The shaman also leads the mystic rituals used to summon an air elemental. Summoning an air elemental is usually done only in preparation for the tribe's most sacred ceremony, the hunt. Small tribes must band together for this ceremony to allow the triumvirate to be formed.</p><p>The ceremony to summon an air elemental must be conducted at dawn and requires the oldest male and female to emit a highpitched keening whistle. The shaman conducts an intricate dance around them, simultaneously chanting an ancient summoning mantra.</p><p>The hunt is the final part of the initiation of adolescent aarakocra to adulthood and often takes the tribe far from their normal teritory. The target is always a <a href=\"/appendix/drakalsi\">silt drake</a>. The hunt is the only time the females leave the relative safety of the nest. Even an evil tribe will not interfere with a tribe on a hunt. An air elemental is often summoned to help find the drake, but never takes part in the actual combat. Although the adult members of the tribe take part in the initial phases of the combat, it is the initiates who deliver the final, killing blows to me drake. Scars from the hunt are considered a mark of pride among all aarakocra.</p><p>The females spend about eight months of the year incubating their eggs. Athasian aarakocra mate for life and a pair normally produces as many as 10 offspring. A female lays one egg a year. Constant incubation is not required because of the high daytime temperatures, so the females can maintain the nest and keep the tribe's treasure in order.</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Ecology:</b> Athasian aarakocra are high on the food chain and have no natural enemies other than <a href=\"/appendix/drakatha\">drakes</a>. Unless evil, aarakocra leave their own territory only to hunt the silt drake and return as soon as possible when the hunt is over. (Evil aarakocra attack others, as noted above.) Aarakocra eggs and hatchlings are sought after by wealthy land owners who wish to use the creatures as scouts and sentries. An egg can bring as much as 10 cp in Tyr's marketplace. Tribes that have had eggs or hatchlings stolen have long memories and sometimes take revenge against the thief at a later date. Captive aarakocra join any tribe they come in contact with.</p><p>Athasian aarakocra have a natural life span of 21-30 years.</p><br clear=\"all\" style=\"clear:both; height:0;\">\r\n","images":["<img src=\"grf/ds.gif\" width=\"150\" height=\"75\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Dark Sun\" title=\"Dark Sun\" align=\"right\">","<img src=\"img/aarakath.gif\" alt=\"Aarakocra (Athas)\" title=\"Aarakocra (Athas)\" border=\"0\" width=\"300\" height=\"360\" style=\"text-align:right;\" align=\"right\">","<img src=\"grf/add2_01.gif\" width=\"200\" height=\"56\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Advanced Dungeons & Dragons 2nd Edition\">"],"setting":"Dark Sun","statblock":{"Aarakocra (Athas)":{"Activity Cycle":"Day","Alignment":"Any","Armor Class":"7","Climate/Terrain":"Deep desert","Damage/Attack":"1d3/1d3 or by weapon","Diet":"Carnivore","Frequency":"Rare","Hit Dice":"2+2","Intelligence":"Average (8-10)","Magic Resistance":"Nil","Morale":"Steady (11)","Movement":"6, Fl 36 (C)","No. Appearing":"1d10","No. of Attacks":"2","Organization":"Tribal","Size":"M (20'+ wingspan)","Special Attacks":"Nil","Special Defenses":"Nil","THAC0":"17","Treasure":"Varies","XP Value":"65"}},"title":"Aarakocra (Athas)"},"sources":["2433"],"statblock_names":[],"title":"Aarakocra (Athas)","prev_key":"zygraat","next_key":"aarakocr","monster_path":"/appendix/aarakath"}}},"pageContext":{"monster_key":"drik","monster_data":{"TSR":["2433"],"fullBody":"  <table cellspacing=\"0\" cellpadding=\"0\"><tr class=\"bk\"><th> </th><th class=\"cn\">Drik</th><th class=\"cn\">High Drik</th></tr><tr><th>Climate/Terrain:</th><td>Rocky badlands</td><td>Rocky badlands</td></tr><tr><th>Frequency:</th><td>Very rare</td><td>Very rare</td></tr><tr><th>Organization:</th><td>Family</td><td>Solitary</td></tr><tr><th>Activity Cycle:</th><td>Day</td><td>Any</td></tr><tr><th>Diet:</th><td>Omnivore</td><td>Carnivore</td></tr><tr><th>Intelligence:</th><td>Animal (1)</td><td>Average (8-10)</td></tr><tr><th>Treasure:</th><td>Nil</td><td>Nil</td></tr><tr><th>Alignment:</th><td>Neutral</td><td>Neutral evil</td></tr><tr><th>No. Appearing:</th><td>2-4 (1d3+1)</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><th>Armor Class:</th><td>2</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><th>Movement:</th><td>6</td><td>12</td></tr><tr><th>Hit Dice:</th><td>16+6</td><td>8+3</td></tr><tr><th>THAC0:</th><td>5</td><td>13</td></tr><tr><th>No. of Attacks:</th><td>2</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><th>Damage/Attack:</th><td>2d8/2d10</td><td>2d6 or by weapon</td></tr><tr><th>Special Attacks:</th><td>Ram</td><td>Magic use, poison</td></tr><tr><th>Special Defenses:</th><td>Nil</td><td>Nil</td></tr><tr><th>Magic Resistance:</th><td>Nil</td><td>30%</td></tr><tr><th>Size:</th><td>G (36' long)</td><td>H (18' tall)</td></tr><tr><th>Morale:</th><td>Elite (13-14)</td><td>Champion (15-16)</td></tr><tr><th>XP Value:</th><td>9,000</td><td>9,000</td></tr></table><p class=\"f\">A drik is a powerful and massive herd <a href=\"/appendix/lizard\">lizard</a>. Its sheer bulk gives it an awesome might, making young driks targets for beast masters from both Urik and Raam to serve in their armies. The capture of the young driks has all but depleted the wild drik.</p><p>A drik is a powerful animal, built low to the ground and covered by a thick horn-encrusted shell. At birth the drik has no shell. But while growing, the young drik secretes a resin and bits of bone that form the beast's carapace. The shell hardens as the creature matures to an adult and protects the drik from behind the head all the way to the tail. This shell is a dark gray, speckled white with bone chips. The scaly hide of the drik is a deep brown, though some appear light brown or even yellow. The drik's heavy body is supported by four thick, stublike legs, each sporting four huge claws. The drik's head is enormous and has two black eyes. It has and a large mouth capable of swallowing a human whole. Several jagged tusks protrude menacingly from below the creature's mouth. The drik communicates with other driks through grunts and bellows. More intelligent creatures must use psionics or magic to communicate with a drik.</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Combat:</b> The drik's short legs and great weight make it ponderous beast, but this apparent lethargy conceals the beast's surprising prowess in melee. Its primary form of attack is its bite that inflicts 2-16 (2d8) points of damage. A drik's head and neck are actually quite agile when it holds them away from the resin shell - almost as if its head and neck weren't connected to its gargantuan body. A causal observer might fall victim to the drik's unnatural quickness and reach.</p><p>A drik can also attack with its clawed forelegs, but the animal needs at least three legs on the ground to maintain balance and support its immense weight. Therefore, only one foreleg attack can be made per round, inflicting 2-20 (2d10) points of crushing and slashing damage if successful.</p><p>The drik can use a ram attack against another drik or other large, slow-moving object. A drik can initiate a ram attack if it has at least 30 feet between it and its target, if the target is gargantuan in size (25 feet or more), and if it doesn't move more than 60 feet per round itself. On a successful attack, the drik's ram attack inflicts 2-24 (2d12) points of damage. The drik's ram attack can also be used against structures. In this case, no attack roll is necessary and the ram damages 1 foot of material for every point below the structure's required saving throw. Saving throws are 7 against stone, 9 against metal and soft stone, and 17 against wood. The drik's ram attack is made in lieu of any other attack.</p><p>A drik does not normally ram anything but another drik that is invading its family's territory. Ram attacks against structures or creatures other than a trespassing drik are made only at the instigation of the beast's handler.</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Habitat/Society:</b> Wild driks live in small family units dominated by a single female. Other adult females are not welcome within a family. They generally eat the grasses and shrubs of the badlands or the slower animals they can catch. Feral driks often lie still and wait for unwary creatures to wander within attack range. They drink from the Black Waters, making it fairly easy for trappers to locate them. Driks are the only animals known that can ingest Hamanu's terrible poisons from the Black Waters and survive.</p><p>In captivity, driks are ideal animals for siege combat. Their natural ram attack is quite valuable, as is their great size and natural protection. Some driks are used to pull massive siege towers or wagons, but often they are used as individual, mobile weapons platforms (see drik war machine, below).</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Ecology:</b> A drik mother lays its eggs in the Black Waters every three years. The young then find the nearest adult female (not necessarily its mother) and become part of that family. A drik reaches adulthood in two years and can live to be 30 years old.</p><p>An adult drik weighs roughly 5 tons and can carry as much as 2,000 pounds on its back before it simply refuses to move. A drik can pull as much as 10 tons on wheeled vehicles or drag 5 tons behind it on a litter or similar platform.</p><p>A drik is particularly foul-tempered in captivity. In battle, each drik has its own psionic master who directs its activities. However, in the everyday life of a captive drik, trainers must deal with them without the benefit of psionicists. Casualties among drik trainers are high. No driks have been bred in captivity.</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Drik War Machine</b></p><p class=\"ni\">A drik war machine is similar to the standard drik, but the shell has been reshaped to allow siege weapons to be mounted on its back. Captors reshape the shell to permit greater ramming power.</p><p>The drik's resin shell is melted and partially reshaped. Workmen with torches flatten the surface of the shell to more readily accept ballistae and catapults. Raamese engineers have perfected a technique whereby a wooden mold is built around an immobilized young drik as its shell is forming. Though only one drik in three survives the process, the results can be spectacular. A drik so customized has siege weapons mounted on its back, the number and damage caused varies by weapon type and the type of structure being attacked.</p><table class=\"ip\"><tr class=\"bk\"><th>Attack Form</th><th>Hard Stone</th><th>Soft Stone</th><th>Metal</th><th>Thin Wood</th><th>Thick Wood</th></tr><tr><td>2 ballistae</td><td>2</td><td>3</td><td>5</td><td>10</td><td>5</td></tr><tr><td>Large catapult</td><td>4</td><td>8</td><td>10</td><td>20</td><td>13</td></tr><tr><td>Small catapult</td><td>8</td><td>11</td><td>8</td><td>17</td><td>9</td></tr><tr><td>Ram (customized)</td><td>9</td><td>12</td><td>12</td><td>20</td><td>19</td></tr></table><h2>High Drik</h2><p class=\"f\">Another more foul and corrupt method for altering the drik is known only to the defilers under the directorship of King Hamanu, warrior king of Urik. The minions of Hamanu are sent to the shores of the Black Waters to find drik eggs. These eggs are brought back to a bestiary that has been especially designed for this type of experimental conversion.</p><p>The defilers use their foul magics to change the way the beasts develop within their eggs. Only 20% of the treated eggs survive the process. The process stunts their growth, allowing them to grow to a maximum height of only 18'. However, the benefits to the armies of Hamanu far outweigh this minor setback.</p><p>High driks are relatively quit and nimble bipeds. Their forelegs have mutated and now boast three fingers instead of the clawed hooves of their brethren. The skin of high driks is a dark, blood-red to black and veins protrude beneath the thick hide of the creatures. Their shells retain a smaller but relatively unchanged shape except that they are more twisted and jagged than the natural form. The shell color ranges from gray to black with sickly-green flecks riddling the surface.</p><p>The tusks around the high driks' heads are proportionately smaller than those of their unaltered relatives. Their mouths, however, are filled with multiple rows of black, razor sharp teeth. Green, viscous fluid seeps from their slavering maws.</p><p>High driks are also relatively intelligent and can speak in a crude form of the common tongue if taught. They can also communicate with other natural driks.</p><p>It is believed that the transformation this creature undergoes causes it to become insane and psychotic. It is, however, impossible to tell as there is no equivalent being to compare the high drik to. At the very least, the high drik is sadistic and cruel, taking great joy in causing pain to others.</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Combat:</b> Because of the high driks' ability to communicate with lower driks, high driks have been implemented by Hamanu's army for use as beast masters to control driks in warfare.</p><p>In melee, high driks can attack using their teeth to cause 2-12 (2d6) points of damage If, while attacking a human-sized opponent or smaller (though no smaller than three feet), a high drik's roll is a natural 20, it has succeeded in tearing a limb from its target. To determine which part is torn off, roll a 1d10: 1 = head, 2-3 = left arm, 4-5 = right arm, 6-7 = right leg. 8-9 = left leg, and 10 = tail (head if no tail). Anyone bitten by a high drik must make a save vs. poison or receive an additional 3-18 (3d6) points in poison damage from the vile green secretions that drool from the beast's mouth.</p><p>High driks can also hold weapons in their three-fingered hands. Weapons of favor are giant versions of the club (7-14 (1d8+6) points of damage), long sword (8-18 (2d6+6) points of damage), spear (8-18 (2d6+61 points of damage), and trident (9-24 (3d6+6) points of damage).</p><p>Because high driks have retained their native language of grunts and growls, they are usually used as beast masters to Hamanu's war driks. The control high driks exercise over war driks requires no psionics or magical links and little training is necessary for a war drik to learn to obey the commands of its high drik master. If a controlling high drik is killed in combat, the war drik becomes confused and begins to rampage, attacking and ramming random structures and even allied driks.</p><p>Capable and even imposing in melee, high driks are at their most formidable while using their innate abilities as defilers and psionicists. High driks have magical abilities equal to those of 8th level defilers, a result of the intense magical treatment the drik eggs receive at the hands of Hamanu's defilers.</p><p>The intensity of the transformation from drik to high drik is so traumatizing to the psyche of the driks that there is a 75% chance the high driks will have psionic wild talents and a 15% chance of them having the abilities of 5th-level psionicists.</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Habitat/Society:</b> High driks are unnatural creations. They are kept in separate quarters especially made for the needs of this creature. They are treated well by the Drajian guards and servants that are entrusted with their care, though few servants have survived longer than a year at the beck and call of high driks. To bring harm to a high drik evokes the fiercest wrath of Hamanu as these are currently some of his most favored subjects.</p><br clear=\"all\" style=\"clear:both; height:0;\">\r\n","images":["<img src=\"grf/ds.gif\" width=\"150\" height=\"75\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Dark Sun\" title=\"Dark Sun\" align=\"right\">","<img src=\"img/drik.gif\" alt=\"Drik\" title=\"Drik\" border=\"0\" width=\"300\" height=\"360\" style=\"text-align:right;\" align=\"right\">","<img src=\"grf/add2_01.gif\" width=\"200\" height=\"56\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Advanced Dungeons & Dragons 2nd Edition\">"],"setting":"Dark Sun","statblock":{"Drik":{"Activity Cycle":"Day","Alignment":"Neutral","Armor Class":"2","Climate/Terrain":"Rocky badlands","Damage/Attack":"2d8/2d10","Diet":"Omnivore","Frequency":"Very rare","Hit Dice":"16+6","Intelligence":"Animal (1)","Magic Resistance":"Nil","Morale":"Elite (13-14)","Movement":"6","No. Appearing":"2-4 (1d3+1)","No. of Attacks":"2","Organization":"Family","Size":"G (36' long)","Special Attacks":"Ram","Special Defenses":"Nil","THAC0":"5","Treasure":"Nil","XP Value":"9,000"},"High Drik":{"Activity Cycle":"Any","Alignment":"Neutral evil","Armor Class":"0","Climate/Terrain":"Rocky badlands","Damage/Attack":"2d6 or by weapon","Diet":"Carnivore","Frequency":"Very rare","Hit Dice":"8+3","Intelligence":"Average (8-10)","Magic Resistance":"30%","Morale":"Champion (15-16)","Movement":"12","No. Appearing":"1","No. of Attacks":"1","Organization":"Solitary","Size":"H (18' tall)","Special Attacks":"Magic use, poison","Special Defenses":"Nil","THAC0":"13","Treasure":"Nil","XP Value":"9,000"}},"title":"Drik"},"sources":["2433"],"statblock_names":[],"title":"Drik","prev_key":"drgturtl","next_key":"drnecndr","monster_path":"/appendix/drik"}},"staticQueryHashes":[],"slicesMap":{}}
