While the powers listed above are the most common, some aarakocra have different or additional powers.</p><p class=\"f\">A race of intelligent, birdlike creatures living in the deepest deserts of Athas, the rare Athasian <a href=\"/appendix/aarakocr\">aarakocra</a> spends its time soaring on thermals in search of food.</p><p>The aarakocra is 7 to 8 feet tall with a wingspan of 20 feet or more. Because of its large wingspan, an aarakocra can carry as much as 75% of its own body weight and still fly easily. An aarakocra can fly a short distance carrying a burden equaling 125% of its own body weight. The average body weight of a full grown male is 100 pounds and a female is 85 pounds.</p><p>Each wing has a &ldquo;hand&rdquo; at its midpoint, consisting of three fingers and an opposable thumb. The fourth finger forms the rigid leading edge of the wing. In flight the hands cannot be used, but on the ground the aarakocra can use its hands almost as a human would. The aarakocra's body is protected by a thin bony plate on the chest, much like a solid rib cage. Talons on its legs can be used as claws and can be retracted to reveal a second set of hands, also with three fingers and an opposable thumb. Except for the chest plate, the entire skeleton is hollow and extremely fragile.</p><p>From a distance, the Athasian aarakocra resembles a huge <a href=\"/appendix/bird\">vulture</a>. Its black eyes, set in the front of the head, provide excellent vision over a long range. The plumage is generally black with a white collar for adult males and black or brown with a smaller white collar for females. Adolescents are a mixture of brown and black. The beak is large and covers most of the head. Plumage begins at the crown of the head and is darker near the head, except for the collar. Athasian aarakocra speak their own language and the languages of vultures and other large birds. Some speak the common tongue (5% to 10% chance depending on how deep in the wastelands a tribe lives).</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Combat:</b> Aarakocra can fight in the air or on the ground. They prefer aerial combat since their bones are too fragile to withstand a solid blow from a human-sized opponent. In combat against creatures on the ground, they prefer to fly over their victim and drop weighted nets. Some aarakocra use darts to harass ground-based opponents.</p><p>If their opponents can fly, the aarakocra generally forgo the use of the net, although large groups sometimes use nets on flying creatures. Normally, aarakocra attack flying creatures with long spears, diving from above and allowing the momentum to carry the spear through the target. Such an attack doubles the damage if the aarakocra have been able to dive at least 50 feet. Only the very largest aarakocra can carry more than one of these spears, they can attack with both at once with no penalty, causing double damage on each strike. All diving attacks are made at +4 and should be treated as a charge attack. All other penalties and restrictions of charge attacks apply.</p><p>The effect of the aarakocra's nets depends on if the opponent is flying at the time it becomes entangled. Creatures on the ground that are hit by a net are entangled and unable to participate in any combat until they make a successful Strength check to get free of the net. Flying creatures hit by a net can no longer fly and immediately begin falling. If they cannot escape the net or use some magical means to arrest the fall, normal falling damage applies.</p><p>Unless victims are entangled in nets, aarakocra are cautious in ground combat. If the aarakocra outnumber their opponents they advance in a straight line and thrust with their spears. If outnumbered, or the opponents are particularly tough, the aarakocra withdraw. Victims entangled in nets are killed or incapacitated for use as food or ransom.</p><p>Athasian aarakocra are mindful of their physical limitations as well as their comparatively low psionic abilities. They do not normally initiate psionic combat. At the first sign of psionic powers from any of their victims, however, all aarakocra that have some ability will use whatever attack and defense modes they can in an attempt to destroy the threat. Large groups of is or more aarakocra may initiate psionic combat if their leaders feel they can win quickly and avoid physical combat.</p><p>In desperation, an aarakocra can attempt to bite an opponent in combat. Because of the unwieldiness of its beak, the aarakocra has a THAC0 of 18 if attacking with this appendage. Further, the birdman causes only 1d2 points of damage with the beak.</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Habitat/Society:</b> Athasian aarakocra live in tribes with 6-20 (2d8+4) members, depending on the prestige of the leader. The largest tribe ever recorded had 50 members. The tribal hunting territory depends on the size of the tribe, usually about 500 square miles for a tribe of 10 members. There are no rigid boundaries between tribes and border disputes are not uncommon.</p><p>Alignments of tribe members are similar to the alignment of the leader. A tribe that has a leader who is neutral good may have neutral good, chaotic good, lawful good, and true neutral members. A predominantly evil tribe does not recognize boundaries with other tribes and treats other tribes as inferior beings to be eliminated.</p><p>Athasian aarakocra aren't happy in enclosed spaces, but they they take refuge in a cave or building if necessary.</p><p>Nonevil tribes live in rocky aeries in the highest peaks they can find. Evil tribes are normally nomadic and use an aerie made by another tribe if they need to remain in an area for a long time, even if they have to evict the tribe that made the nest.</p><p>Aarakocra aren't friendly toward intruders in their territory, especially caravans. They try to extract a toll from the caravan for passage through the desert. Good-aligned tribes allow unhindered passage of caravans that pay a tribute. If someone refuses to pay the tribute, the aarakocra try to capture scouts or outriders from the party and hold them until an even larger tribute is paid. The payment may be either livestock or shiny objects. Aarakocra are smart enough not to be taken in by glass baubles instead of gems, although they cannot tell the difference between the more common gems and the rare ones.</p><p>Evil tribes ask for tribute and often attack a caravan whether it pays or not. Aarakocra always demand shiny objects such as stones. These tribes find humans and demihumans to be quite tasty and prefer them to other food.</p><p>Good-aligned tribes of aarakocra sometimes return a lost traveler to the edge of the desert after first removing any valuables the traveler may be carrying. On very rare occasions a tribe might return a lost group of travelers to the more frequently traveled parts of the desert, again after first taking any valuables as payment.</p><p>The oldest male is the leader of the tribal hunting party and has 4+4 Hit Dice. The oldest female is in charge of the tribal aerie and has 3+3 HD. In tribes that have more than 15 members, the next oldest aarakocra serves as shaman and has 3+3 HD; the shaman completes the triumvirate necessary for proper worship and the summoning of elementals. (Interestingly, no magic-using aarakocra has ever been recorded.) Tribes without a shaman cannot summon <a href=\"/appendix/element1\">air elementals</a>, which is an important part of aarakocra culture.</p><p>The shaman is the leader of the daily sun worship. Aarakocra worship the sun because it provides them with the thermals they need to soar in search of food. The shaman also leads the mystic rituals used to summon an air elemental. Summoning an air elemental is usually done only in preparation for the tribe's most sacred ceremony, the hunt. Small tribes must band together for this ceremony to allow the triumvirate to be formed.</p><p>The ceremony to summon an air elemental must be conducted at dawn and requires the oldest male and female to emit a highpitched keening whistle. The shaman conducts an intricate dance around them, simultaneously chanting an ancient summoning mantra.</p><p>The hunt is the final part of the initiation of adolescent aarakocra to adulthood and often takes the tribe far from their normal teritory. The target is always a <a href=\"/appendix/drakalsi\">silt drake</a>. The hunt is the only time the females leave the relative safety of the nest. Even an evil tribe will not interfere with a tribe on a hunt. An air elemental is often summoned to help find the drake, but never takes part in the actual combat. Although the adult members of the tribe take part in the initial phases of the combat, it is the initiates who deliver the final, killing blows to me drake. Scars from the hunt are considered a mark of pride among all aarakocra.</p><p>The females spend about eight months of the year incubating their eggs. Athasian aarakocra mate for life and a pair normally produces as many as 10 offspring. A female lays one egg a year. Constant incubation is not required because of the high daytime temperatures, so the females can maintain the nest and keep the tribe's treasure in order.</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Ecology:</b> Athasian aarakocra are high on the food chain and have no natural enemies other than <a href=\"/appendix/drakatha\">drakes</a>. Unless evil, aarakocra leave their own territory only to hunt the silt drake and return as soon as possible when the hunt is over. (Evil aarakocra attack others, as noted above.) Aarakocra eggs and hatchlings are sought after by wealthy land owners who wish to use the creatures as scouts and sentries. An egg can bring as much as 10 cp in Tyr's marketplace. Tribes that have had eggs or hatchlings stolen have long memories and sometimes take revenge against the thief at a later date. Captive aarakocra join any tribe they come in contact with.</p><p>Athasian aarakocra have a natural life span of 21-30 years.</p>\n","images":["<img src=\"grf/ds.gif\" width=\"150\" height=\"75\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Dark Sun\" title=\"Dark Sun\" align=\"right\">","<img src=\"img/aarakath.gif\" alt=\"Aarakocra (Athas)\" title=\"Aarakocra (Athas)\" border=\"0\" width=\"300\" height=\"360\" style=\"text-align:right;\" align=\"right\">","<img src=\"grf/add2_01.gif\" width=\"200\" height=\"56\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Advanced Dungeons & Dragons 2nd Edition\">"],"setting":"Dark Sun","statblock":{"Aarakocra (Athas)":{"Activity Cycle":"Day","Alignment":"Any","Armor Class":"7","Climate/Terrain":"Deep desert","Damage/Attack":"1d3/1d3 or by weapon","Diet":"Carnivore","Frequency":"Rare","Hit Dice":"2+2","Intelligence":"Average (8-10)","Magic Resistance":"Nil","Morale":"Steady (11)","Movement":"6, Fl 36 (C)","No. Appearing":"1d10","No. of Attacks":"2","Organization":"Tribal","Size":"M (20'+ wingspan)","Special Attacks":"Nil","Special Defenses":"Nil","THAC0":"17","Treasure":"Varies","XP Value":"65"}},"title":"Aarakocra (Athas)"},"sources":["2433"],"statblock_names":[],"title":"Aarakocra (Athas)","prev_key":"zygraat","next_key":"aarakocr","monster_path":"/appendix/aarakath"}}},"pageContext":{"monster_key":"aranea","monster_data":{"TSR":["2166","2524"],"fullBody":"  <table cellspacing=\"0\" cellpadding=\"0\"><tr><th>Climate/Terrain:</th><td>Any</td></tr><tr><th>Frequency:</th><td>Uncommon</td></tr><tr><th>Organization:</th><td>Clan</td></tr><tr><th>Activity Cycle:</th><td>Any</td></tr><tr><th>Diet:</th><td>Omnivore</td></tr><tr><th>Intelligence:</th><td>High (13-14)</td></tr><tr><th>Treasure:</th><td>M,O (U)</td></tr><tr><th>Alignment:</th><td>Neutral</td></tr><tr><th>No. Appearing:</th><td>1d6</td></tr><tr><th>Armor Class:</th><td>7</td></tr><tr><th>Movement:</th><td>18, Wb 12</td></tr><tr><th>Hit Dice:</th><td>3</td></tr><tr><th>THAC0:</th><td>17</td></tr><tr><th>No. of Attacks:</th><td>1</td></tr><tr><th>Damage/Attack:</th><td>1d6 (or by weapon)</td></tr><tr><th>Special Attacks:</th><td>Poison, spells, webbing</td></tr><tr><th>Special Defenses:</th><td>Spells, webbing</td></tr><tr><th>Magic Resistance:</th><td>Nil</td></tr><tr><th>Size:</th><td>M (6' diameter)</td></tr><tr><th>Morale:</th><td>Steady (11-12)</td></tr><tr><th>XP Value:</th><td>650</td></tr></table><p class=\"f\"><a href=\"/appendix/spidekin\">Aranea</a> are intelligent, forest-dwelling arachnoids that are skilled in magic use. They have two true forms - that of a humanoid and that of a large, intelligent <a href=\"/appendix/spider\">spider</a> - and can shapeshift into a hybrid form that combines the two.</p><p>In <i>humanoid form</i>, an aranea resembles one other creature, from as small as a <a href=\"/appendix/goblin\">goblin</a> to as large as a <a href=\"/appendix/gnoll\">gnoll</a>. Human, elf, and half-elf forms are common. In <i>spider form</i>, an aranea resembles a large spider, hut has an oddly-shaped lump on its back that houses its brain. Beneath its impressive mandibles, sprouting from the front of its body, are two small limbs, each about two feet long. Each of the small limbs has four fingers plus a single thumb (the fingers are many-jointed and the thumb has an extra joint). The <i>hybrid form</i> is humanoid with arachnid elements: fangs, two spinnerets (in the palm of each hand), and four eyes (the second pair often in the temples). Each finger and thumb typically has an extra joint as well. No two aranea have exactly the same hybrid form.</p><p>Most aranea are neutral, thoueh most others think them to be evil. Aranea have infravision with a range of 60 feet. Aranea have their own lanruage and each knows the native Lmguage of the race they emulate.</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Combat:</b> Araneas prefer to avoid physical combat when possible, relying instead on magical abilities. In arachnid form, they wait in trees for prey to pass underneath; then, they lower themselves silently on web strands and attack with spells. A victim attacked in this manner suffers a -1 penalty to surprise rolls. In humanoid or demispider form, araneas battle as per the emulated race.</p><p>Each aranea is considered to be at least a 3rd-level mage. (Araneas retain the 8-sided Hit Die up to this level, then using the appropriate Hit Die for their class.) This represents their natural relationship with magic and their initial years of training. Most are specialist wizards, preferring illusions and charms but avoiding fire-based spells. Araneas can cast spells in any of their three forms. To avoid arousing suspicion, araneas living among other humanoids keep their spellcasting abilities secret unless they are posing as mages. Most araneas do continue to pursue the magical practices &ndash; at least in private &ndash; and are higher than 3rd level. Many araneas become multi-class mages, gaining the additional benefit of swordplay or thieving abilities. Single-class thieves are not uncommon, but single-class clerics or fighters are very rare. Even as a single-class character, though, an aranea still retains its abilities as a third-level mage. This is considered more a dual-class than multi-class.</p><p>If forced into physical combat, an adult aranea can attempt to bite and inject venom into an opponent. This can only be accomplished in spider or demispider form and requires a successful attack roll. A victim who fails a saving throw vs. poison immediately feels a faint stiffness in his limbs and takes 1d4 points of damage per round for 1d4 rounds, cumulative for each successful bite. The aranean venom loses potency after a short time, so it cannot be saved and used on weapons.</p><p>Upon reaching maturity, araneas can also learn to spin webs. As with the poisonous bite, an aranea can spin or climb webs only while in arachnid or demispider form. This ability does not make araneas immune to the web spell. An aranea can produce up to 10 feet of webbing per level per day &ndash; half from each spinneret. Web strands measure ¼ inch in diameter and are strong enough to support approximately 500 pounds. Entangling an opponent with a web requires a normal attack roll. Severing a strand requires only 2 points of cutting damage (which must be inflicted in a single blow) or a successful open doors roll. Immobilizing a man-sized creature requires at least 20 feet of webbing, but considerably less is needed to entangle.</p><p>Araneas wear armor only if allowed by class. In humanoid form they have a base AC of 10. In arachnid form, they have an Armor Class of 7. If an aranea shifts into arachnid form while wearing armor, it takes damage equal to 10 points minus the AC value of the armor. Magical armor must also be removed unless it has the power to alter its size. In this case, the armor expands enough for the aranea to slip out of it during transformation.</p><p>Araneas possess 60-foot infravision and the ability to change form. The aranean shapechanging ability is natural, and young araneas have complete control within a few weeks of birth. Though not physically limited by a specific number of transformations per day, an aranea trying to maintain secrecy will never assume arachnid or demispider form among nonaranea. It requires 1 round to shift between arachnid and demispider or demispider and humanoid. Thus, changing from humanoid to arachnid or the reverse takes a minimum of 2 rounds. The demispider form is merely transitionary and can never be maintained for more than 2 rounds per level.</p><p>An aranea in humanoid form effectively becomes a member of the emulated race and possesses any special abilities that the race has to offer: hearing, special vision, familiarity with tunnels, etc.</p><p>The aranean shapechanging ability gives each aranea two true forms. For this reason, the creature's true race cannot be determined unless someone actually sees the transformation, can read the aranea's mind, or possesses some other extraordinary means. Even a <i>true seeing</i> spell is useless unless the aranea is in demispider form; if this happens, there is an equal chance that it will reveal either the aranea's humanoid or arachnid form. Since the <i>identify species</i> spell was originally invented by the araneas, it is useless against them. Though the shapechanging ability was originally gained through arcane means, neither form is truly magical, so a <i>dispel magic</i> cast on the aranea while it is in humanoid form will not cause it to revert to its arachnid form. If successfully cast on the demispider form (using the aranea's level or Hit Dice as the value of the opposing caster), there is an equal chance that the aranea will revert to its humanoid or arachnid form.</p><p>The shapechanging ability gives araneas partial immunity to <i>polymorph</i> spells, as with <a href=\"/appendix/lycanthr\">lycanthropes</a> and <a href=\"/appendix/doppelga\">doppelgangers</a>. They can resume their normal form after being affected by the spell for 1 round. However, weapons designed to battle shapechangers are also more effective against araneas (as with a <i>sword +1, +3 versus lycanthropes and shapechangers</i>). Shapechanging does not restore any lost hit points and, if killed, the aranea remains in the form held just before death.</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Habitat/Society:</b> Araneas prefer to live in forests, the natural home of their ancestors, where they can hunt and hide. They are the secret rulers of the Magiocracy of Herath, where the cities and villages resemble those of neighboring lands, though with a more diverse mixture of races.</p><p>Araneas take great pains to conceal their dual nature, partly because of the unjust animosity felt toward them by other races. From birth, they are taught that they have two distinct identities. Individuals are forced to keep these two identities separate, never to reveal the secret to other races. Those who do are considered traitors; they are dealt with harshly and quickly by other araneas.</p><p>Due to old legends of their purported evil, araneas are almost universally despised as a sort of <q>bogeyman</q>. A revealed aranea will most likely be hunted down by everyone in the area &ndash; especially other araneas. The pose of a <q>tame</q> aranea who has <q>converted to the cause of good</q> may be possible, but it would still be hunted by other araneas.</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Ecology:</b> Araneas use magic to subdue their environment, shaping it to fit their desires. For this reason they can never resist magical items and will go to any extremes to obtain them. They are predators, and many enjoy the flesh of sentient beings, though these are the exception rather than the rule. Araneas are generally talented in cloth production and naturally dominate the silk market with the silk they produce.</p><p>Most araneas feel superior to other races due to their long history and special abilities. They can be cold, calculating, and secretive, but they are rarely evil. They also tend to be suspicious of others, expecting them to have secrets as well. Currently, these shapeshifters get along with the nearby races.</p>\n","images":["<img src=\"grf/rs.gif\" width=\"150\" height=\"75\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Red Steel (Mystara)\" title=\"Red Steel (Mystara)\" align=\"right\">","<img src=\"img/aranea.gif\" alt=\"Aranea (Savage Coast)\" title=\"Aranea (Savage Coast)\" border=\"0\" width=\"300\" height=\"360\" style=\"text-align:right;\" align=\"right\">","<img src=\"grf/add2_01.gif\" width=\"200\" height=\"56\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Advanced Dungeons & Dragons 2nd Edition\">"],"setting":"Red Steel (Mystara)","statblock":{"Aranea (Savage Coast)":{"Activity Cycle":"Any","Alignment":"Neutral","Armor Class":"7","Climate/Terrain":"Any","Damage/Attack":"1d6 (or by weapon)","Diet":"Omnivore","Frequency":"Uncommon","Hit Dice":"3","Intelligence":"High (13-14)","Magic Resistance":"Nil","Morale":"Steady (11-12)","Movement":"18, Wb 12","No. Appearing":"1d6","No. of Attacks":"1","Organization":"Clan","Size":"M (6' diameter)","Special Attacks":"Poison, spells, webbing","Special Defenses":"Spells, webbing","THAC0":"17","Treasure":"M,O (U)","XP Value":"650"}},"title":"Aranea (Savage Coast)"},"sources":["2166","2524"],"statblock_names":[],"title":"Aranea (Savage Coast)","prev_key":"arakteg","next_key":"arashaee","monster_path":"/appendix/aranea"}},"staticQueryHashes":[],"slicesMap":{}}
