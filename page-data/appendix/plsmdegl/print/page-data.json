While the powers listed above are the most common, some aarakocra have different or additional powers.</p><p class=\"f\">A race of intelligent, birdlike creatures living in the deepest deserts of Athas, the rare Athasian <a href=\"/appendix/aarakocr\">aarakocra</a> spends its time soaring on thermals in search of food.</p><p>The aarakocra is 7 to 8 feet tall with a wingspan of 20 feet or more. Because of its large wingspan, an aarakocra can carry as much as 75% of its own body weight and still fly easily. An aarakocra can fly a short distance carrying a burden equaling 125% of its own body weight. The average body weight of a full grown male is 100 pounds and a female is 85 pounds.</p><p>Each wing has a &ldquo;hand&rdquo; at its midpoint, consisting of three fingers and an opposable thumb. The fourth finger forms the rigid leading edge of the wing. In flight the hands cannot be used, but on the ground the aarakocra can use its hands almost as a human would. The aarakocra's body is protected by a thin bony plate on the chest, much like a solid rib cage. Talons on its legs can be used as claws and can be retracted to reveal a second set of hands, also with three fingers and an opposable thumb. Except for the chest plate, the entire skeleton is hollow and extremely fragile.</p><p>From a distance, the Athasian aarakocra resembles a huge <a href=\"/appendix/bird\">vulture</a>. Its black eyes, set in the front of the head, provide excellent vision over a long range. The plumage is generally black with a white collar for adult males and black or brown with a smaller white collar for females. Adolescents are a mixture of brown and black. The beak is large and covers most of the head. Plumage begins at the crown of the head and is darker near the head, except for the collar. Athasian aarakocra speak their own language and the languages of vultures and other large birds. Some speak the common tongue (5% to 10% chance depending on how deep in the wastelands a tribe lives).</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Combat:</b> Aarakocra can fight in the air or on the ground. They prefer aerial combat since their bones are too fragile to withstand a solid blow from a human-sized opponent. In combat against creatures on the ground, they prefer to fly over their victim and drop weighted nets. Some aarakocra use darts to harass ground-based opponents.</p><p>If their opponents can fly, the aarakocra generally forgo the use of the net, although large groups sometimes use nets on flying creatures. Normally, aarakocra attack flying creatures with long spears, diving from above and allowing the momentum to carry the spear through the target. Such an attack doubles the damage if the aarakocra have been able to dive at least 50 feet. Only the very largest aarakocra can carry more than one of these spears, they can attack with both at once with no penalty, causing double damage on each strike. All diving attacks are made at +4 and should be treated as a charge attack. All other penalties and restrictions of charge attacks apply.</p><p>The effect of the aarakocra's nets depends on if the opponent is flying at the time it becomes entangled. Creatures on the ground that are hit by a net are entangled and unable to participate in any combat until they make a successful Strength check to get free of the net. Flying creatures hit by a net can no longer fly and immediately begin falling. If they cannot escape the net or use some magical means to arrest the fall, normal falling damage applies.</p><p>Unless victims are entangled in nets, aarakocra are cautious in ground combat. If the aarakocra outnumber their opponents they advance in a straight line and thrust with their spears. If outnumbered, or the opponents are particularly tough, the aarakocra withdraw. Victims entangled in nets are killed or incapacitated for use as food or ransom.</p><p>Athasian aarakocra are mindful of their physical limitations as well as their comparatively low psionic abilities. They do not normally initiate psionic combat. At the first sign of psionic powers from any of their victims, however, all aarakocra that have some ability will use whatever attack and defense modes they can in an attempt to destroy the threat. Large groups of is or more aarakocra may initiate psionic combat if their leaders feel they can win quickly and avoid physical combat.</p><p>In desperation, an aarakocra can attempt to bite an opponent in combat. Because of the unwieldiness of its beak, the aarakocra has a THAC0 of 18 if attacking with this appendage. Further, the birdman causes only 1d2 points of damage with the beak.</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Habitat/Society:</b> Athasian aarakocra live in tribes with 6-20 (2d8+4) members, depending on the prestige of the leader. The largest tribe ever recorded had 50 members. The tribal hunting territory depends on the size of the tribe, usually about 500 square miles for a tribe of 10 members. There are no rigid boundaries between tribes and border disputes are not uncommon.</p><p>Alignments of tribe members are similar to the alignment of the leader. A tribe that has a leader who is neutral good may have neutral good, chaotic good, lawful good, and true neutral members. A predominantly evil tribe does not recognize boundaries with other tribes and treats other tribes as inferior beings to be eliminated.</p><p>Athasian aarakocra aren't happy in enclosed spaces, but they they take refuge in a cave or building if necessary.</p><p>Nonevil tribes live in rocky aeries in the highest peaks they can find. Evil tribes are normally nomadic and use an aerie made by another tribe if they need to remain in an area for a long time, even if they have to evict the tribe that made the nest.</p><p>Aarakocra aren't friendly toward intruders in their territory, especially caravans. They try to extract a toll from the caravan for passage through the desert. Good-aligned tribes allow unhindered passage of caravans that pay a tribute. If someone refuses to pay the tribute, the aarakocra try to capture scouts or outriders from the party and hold them until an even larger tribute is paid. The payment may be either livestock or shiny objects. Aarakocra are smart enough not to be taken in by glass baubles instead of gems, although they cannot tell the difference between the more common gems and the rare ones.</p><p>Evil tribes ask for tribute and often attack a caravan whether it pays or not. Aarakocra always demand shiny objects such as stones. These tribes find humans and demihumans to be quite tasty and prefer them to other food.</p><p>Good-aligned tribes of aarakocra sometimes return a lost traveler to the edge of the desert after first removing any valuables the traveler may be carrying. On very rare occasions a tribe might return a lost group of travelers to the more frequently traveled parts of the desert, again after first taking any valuables as payment.</p><p>The oldest male is the leader of the tribal hunting party and has 4+4 Hit Dice. The oldest female is in charge of the tribal aerie and has 3+3 HD. In tribes that have more than 15 members, the next oldest aarakocra serves as shaman and has 3+3 HD; the shaman completes the triumvirate necessary for proper worship and the summoning of elementals. (Interestingly, no magic-using aarakocra has ever been recorded.) Tribes without a shaman cannot summon <a href=\"/appendix/element1\">air elementals</a>, which is an important part of aarakocra culture.</p><p>The shaman is the leader of the daily sun worship. Aarakocra worship the sun because it provides them with the thermals they need to soar in search of food. The shaman also leads the mystic rituals used to summon an air elemental. Summoning an air elemental is usually done only in preparation for the tribe's most sacred ceremony, the hunt. Small tribes must band together for this ceremony to allow the triumvirate to be formed.</p><p>The ceremony to summon an air elemental must be conducted at dawn and requires the oldest male and female to emit a highpitched keening whistle. The shaman conducts an intricate dance around them, simultaneously chanting an ancient summoning mantra.</p><p>The hunt is the final part of the initiation of adolescent aarakocra to adulthood and often takes the tribe far from their normal teritory. The target is always a <a href=\"/appendix/drakalsi\">silt drake</a>. The hunt is the only time the females leave the relative safety of the nest. Even an evil tribe will not interfere with a tribe on a hunt. An air elemental is often summoned to help find the drake, but never takes part in the actual combat. Although the adult members of the tribe take part in the initial phases of the combat, it is the initiates who deliver the final, killing blows to me drake. Scars from the hunt are considered a mark of pride among all aarakocra.</p><p>The females spend about eight months of the year incubating their eggs. Athasian aarakocra mate for life and a pair normally produces as many as 10 offspring. A female lays one egg a year. Constant incubation is not required because of the high daytime temperatures, so the females can maintain the nest and keep the tribe's treasure in order.</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Ecology:</b> Athasian aarakocra are high on the food chain and have no natural enemies other than <a href=\"/appendix/drakatha\">drakes</a>. Unless evil, aarakocra leave their own territory only to hunt the silt drake and return as soon as possible when the hunt is over. (Evil aarakocra attack others, as noted above.) Aarakocra eggs and hatchlings are sought after by wealthy land owners who wish to use the creatures as scouts and sentries. An egg can bring as much as 10 cp in Tyr's marketplace. Tribes that have had eggs or hatchlings stolen have long memories and sometimes take revenge against the thief at a later date. Captive aarakocra join any tribe they come in contact with.</p><p>Athasian aarakocra have a natural life span of 21-30 years.</p><br clear=\"all\" style=\"clear:both; height:0;\">\r\n","images":["<img src=\"grf/ds.gif\" width=\"150\" height=\"75\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Dark Sun\" title=\"Dark Sun\" align=\"right\">","<img src=\"img/aarakath.gif\" alt=\"Aarakocra (Athas)\" title=\"Aarakocra (Athas)\" border=\"0\" width=\"300\" height=\"360\" style=\"text-align:right;\" align=\"right\">","<img src=\"grf/add2_01.gif\" width=\"200\" height=\"56\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Advanced Dungeons & Dragons 2nd Edition\">"],"setting":"Dark Sun","statblock":{"Aarakocra (Athas)":{"Activity Cycle":"Day","Alignment":"Any","Armor Class":"7","Climate/Terrain":"Deep desert","Damage/Attack":"1d3/1d3 or by weapon","Diet":"Carnivore","Frequency":"Rare","Hit Dice":"2+2","Intelligence":"Average (8-10)","Magic Resistance":"Nil","Morale":"Steady (11)","Movement":"6, Fl 36 (C)","No. Appearing":"1d10","No. of Attacks":"2","Organization":"Tribal","Size":"M (20'+ wingspan)","Special Attacks":"Nil","Special Defenses":"Nil","THAC0":"17","Treasure":"Varies","XP Value":"65"}},"title":"Aarakocra (Athas)"},"sources":["2433"],"statblock_names":[],"title":"Aarakocra (Athas)","prev_key":"zygraat","next_key":"aarakocr","monster_path":"/appendix/aarakath"}}},"pageContext":{"monster_key":"plsmdegl","monster_data":{"TSR":["2109"],"fullBody":"  <table cellspacing=\"0\" cellpadding=\"0\"><tr><th>Climate/Terrain:</th><td>Non-arid/Any</td></tr><tr><th>Frequency:</th><td>Rare</td></tr><tr><th>Organization:</th><td>Family</td></tr><tr><th>Activity Cycle:</th><td>Any</td></tr><tr><th>Diet:</th><td>Scavenger</td></tr><tr><th>Intelligence:</th><td>Average (8-10)</td></tr><tr><th>Treasure:</th><td>K,L,M (D)</td></tr><tr><th>Alignment:</th><td>Any (seldom evil)</td></tr><tr><th>No. Appearing:</th><td>1-6</td></tr><tr><th>Armor Class:</th><td>2</td></tr><tr><th>Movement:</th><td>9</td></tr><tr><th>Hit Dice:</th><td>8</td></tr><tr><th>THAC0:</th><td>13</td></tr><tr><th>No. of Attacks:</th><td>1-4+</td></tr><tr><th>Damage/Attack:</th><td>1-8 or weapon +3</td></tr><tr><th>Special Attacks:</th><td>Boom, absorb</td></tr><tr><th>Special Defenses:</th><td>See below</td></tr><tr><th>Magic Resistance:</th><td>Nil</td></tr><tr><th>Size:</th><td>M-H (varies)</td></tr><tr><th>Morale:</th><td>Average (10)</td></tr><tr><th>XP Value:</th><td>10,000</td></tr></table><p class=\"f\">See &ldquo;<a href=\"/appendix/plsmoid\">Plasmoid, General Information</a>&rdquo; for base information on this race.</p><p>DeGleash are large, wet blobs that favor a form resembling a bowling pin (a fat base with a narrowing upper body). They are white to cream colored and constantly sway and bob about. They prefer to use no legs, propelling themselves forward by having their bases flow over the surface. They can do this at a rate of 9. They also prefer to form only enough arms for the task at hand (thus they have no arms when not trying to manipulate something). These arms tend to be short and stalk-like. They employ two ganglia masses for eyes, which they usually place high on their bodies. Their auditory nerves are usually scattered about their body. Waste constantly excretes via osmosis through their thin outer membrane. They rarely form a mouth orifice.</p><p>DeGleash can produce four arms of 18/01-18/50 strength. If all of their fibers are put into one slow muscle (not for attack) they can lift as much as 10,000 lbs. for short durations (1d4 rounds).</p><p>They can form appendages as fine as a 1/16 inch in diameter. They can absorb or produce limbs as fast as a human can move his arm. DeGleash have such incredible control over their bodies that a net cast over a deGleash would slowly pass through its body if it desired (it just disconnects nerves and fibers where the net's strands are passing, then reconnects them afterward).</p><p>The least malleable part of a deGleash is its brain, but even that can be quickly squashed into a five-inch diameter tube that is one fool long. If a deGleash spends several hours, it can slowly string its brain out to fit through a hole only one inch in diameter (the smallest hole a deGleash can pass through).</p><p>A man-sized deGleash can stretch thin enough to reach something 50 feet in the air (large-sized ones can reach 75 feet, huge ones can stretch 100 feet). To stretch this thin requires one round. Likewise a deGleash could move through a one-foot-diameter hole in a round. Smaller holes take a lot more time, up to several hours to fit through a one-inch hole.</p><p>DeGleash can secrete a calcium-based substance that quickly hardens and forms a shell around them. This is too fragile to add to their AC, but it is useful to keep them from flowing all over while they sleep. When they wake, they reabsorb the shell.</p><p>They can carry up to 1,200 lbs. of items within their bodies if the items' overall volume is a cubic yard or less. DeGleash themselves weigh 2,000, 4,000, and 8,000 lbs. (for size M, L, and H, respectively). They are incapable of jumping, but they can climb wails with 90% success.</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Combat:</b> DeGleash can use 1d4 arms in combat with no penalties. Additional arms inflict a -2 attack roll penalty for all arms. They prefer to attack with two pseudopod fists and wield two shields (AC 0). They can strike an opponent up to 8' away with full strength (greater distances reduce the damage by 2 points per foot).</p><p>DeGleash get very excited before and during combat. It is a habit of this species to begin booming at this time. Opponents who hear this terrible sound must roll successful saving throws vs. petrification or be struck with dread (penalties of +2 and -2 on combat rolls). If a deGleash concentrates for one round, it can release a tremendous boom that requires all within 20 feet to make saving throws vs. paralyzation or become deaf for 1d20 rounds (+2 penalty to AC). Finally, deGleash can envelop enemies who are at least one size smaller than they. This requires a THAC0 roll, adjusted only by the victim's Dexterity. Once enveloped, a victim suffers 1d8 points of digestive damage per round. Furthermore, if the deGleash concentrates, it can bring its muscle fibers to bear upon the hapless foe, holding him with an effective Strength of 20, causing 8 additional points of damage a round. If the victim is not held, a successful bend bars roll enables him to move; if held, three consecutive successful bend bars rolls must be made. Of course, suffocation is a problem for those enveloped as well.</p><p>DeGleash suffer no damage from piercing weapons, &#189; damage from slashing weapons, and full damage from bludgeoning weapons. Fire causes double damage. Cold-based attacks slow them by 1 per 10 dice of damage.</p><p>As with all plasmoids, deGleash are immune to disease and poison of all types. Only acid damage in excess of 30 points per round can harm them.</p><p>A deGleash's AC is due to its ability to shape its body away from an attacking blow. It can even open into a ring.</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Habitat/Society:</b> See the comments under &ldquo;<a href=\"/appendix/plsmoid\">Plasmoid, General Information</a>&rdquo;.</p><br clear=\"all\" style=\"clear:both; height:0;\">\r\n","images":["<img src=\"grf/sj.gif\" width=\"150\" height=\"75\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Spelljammer\" title=\"Spelljammer\" align=\"right\">","<img src=\"img/plsmdegl.gif\" alt=\"Plasmoid, DeGleash\" title=\"Plasmoid, DeGleash\" border=\"0\" width=\"300\" height=\"360\" style=\"text-align:right;\" align=\"right\">","<img src=\"grf/add2_01.gif\" width=\"200\" height=\"56\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Advanced Dungeons & Dragons 2nd Edition\">"],"setting":"Spelljammer","statblock":{"Plasmoid, DeGleash":{"Activity Cycle":"Any","Alignment":"Any (seldom evil)","Armor Class":"2","Climate/Terrain":"Non-arid/Any","Damage/Attack":"1-8 or weapon +3","Diet":"Scavenger","Frequency":"Rare","Hit Dice":"8","Intelligence":"Average (8-10)","Magic Resistance":"Nil","Morale":"Average (10)","Movement":"9","No. Appearing":"1-6","No. of Attacks":"1-4+","Organization":"Family","Size":"M-H (varies)","Special Attacks":"Boom, absorb","Special Defenses":"See below","THAC0":"13","Treasure":"K,L,M (D)","XP Value":"10,000"}},"title":"Plasmoid, DeGleash"},"sources":["2109"],"statblock_names":[],"title":"Plasmoid, DeGleash","prev_key":"pleianim","next_key":"plsmdeln","monster_path":"/appendix/plsmdegl"}},"staticQueryHashes":[],"slicesMap":{}}
