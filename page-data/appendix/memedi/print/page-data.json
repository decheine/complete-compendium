While the powers listed above are the most common, some aarakocra have different or additional powers.</p><p class=\"f\">A race of intelligent, birdlike creatures living in the deepest deserts of Athas, the rare Athasian <a href=\"/appendix/aarakocr\">aarakocra</a> spends its time soaring on thermals in search of food.</p><p>The aarakocra is 7 to 8 feet tall with a wingspan of 20 feet or more. Because of its large wingspan, an aarakocra can carry as much as 75% of its own body weight and still fly easily. An aarakocra can fly a short distance carrying a burden equaling 125% of its own body weight. The average body weight of a full grown male is 100 pounds and a female is 85 pounds.</p><p>Each wing has a &ldquo;hand&rdquo; at its midpoint, consisting of three fingers and an opposable thumb. The fourth finger forms the rigid leading edge of the wing. In flight the hands cannot be used, but on the ground the aarakocra can use its hands almost as a human would. The aarakocra's body is protected by a thin bony plate on the chest, much like a solid rib cage. Talons on its legs can be used as claws and can be retracted to reveal a second set of hands, also with three fingers and an opposable thumb. Except for the chest plate, the entire skeleton is hollow and extremely fragile.</p><p>From a distance, the Athasian aarakocra resembles a huge <a href=\"/appendix/bird\">vulture</a>. Its black eyes, set in the front of the head, provide excellent vision over a long range. The plumage is generally black with a white collar for adult males and black or brown with a smaller white collar for females. Adolescents are a mixture of brown and black. The beak is large and covers most of the head. Plumage begins at the crown of the head and is darker near the head, except for the collar. Athasian aarakocra speak their own language and the languages of vultures and other large birds. Some speak the common tongue (5% to 10% chance depending on how deep in the wastelands a tribe lives).</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Combat:</b> Aarakocra can fight in the air or on the ground. They prefer aerial combat since their bones are too fragile to withstand a solid blow from a human-sized opponent. In combat against creatures on the ground, they prefer to fly over their victim and drop weighted nets. Some aarakocra use darts to harass ground-based opponents.</p><p>If their opponents can fly, the aarakocra generally forgo the use of the net, although large groups sometimes use nets on flying creatures. Normally, aarakocra attack flying creatures with long spears, diving from above and allowing the momentum to carry the spear through the target. Such an attack doubles the damage if the aarakocra have been able to dive at least 50 feet. Only the very largest aarakocra can carry more than one of these spears, they can attack with both at once with no penalty, causing double damage on each strike. All diving attacks are made at +4 and should be treated as a charge attack. All other penalties and restrictions of charge attacks apply.</p><p>The effect of the aarakocra's nets depends on if the opponent is flying at the time it becomes entangled. Creatures on the ground that are hit by a net are entangled and unable to participate in any combat until they make a successful Strength check to get free of the net. Flying creatures hit by a net can no longer fly and immediately begin falling. If they cannot escape the net or use some magical means to arrest the fall, normal falling damage applies.</p><p>Unless victims are entangled in nets, aarakocra are cautious in ground combat. If the aarakocra outnumber their opponents they advance in a straight line and thrust with their spears. If outnumbered, or the opponents are particularly tough, the aarakocra withdraw. Victims entangled in nets are killed or incapacitated for use as food or ransom.</p><p>Athasian aarakocra are mindful of their physical limitations as well as their comparatively low psionic abilities. They do not normally initiate psionic combat. At the first sign of psionic powers from any of their victims, however, all aarakocra that have some ability will use whatever attack and defense modes they can in an attempt to destroy the threat. Large groups of is or more aarakocra may initiate psionic combat if their leaders feel they can win quickly and avoid physical combat.</p><p>In desperation, an aarakocra can attempt to bite an opponent in combat. Because of the unwieldiness of its beak, the aarakocra has a THAC0 of 18 if attacking with this appendage. Further, the birdman causes only 1d2 points of damage with the beak.</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Habitat/Society:</b> Athasian aarakocra live in tribes with 6-20 (2d8+4) members, depending on the prestige of the leader. The largest tribe ever recorded had 50 members. The tribal hunting territory depends on the size of the tribe, usually about 500 square miles for a tribe of 10 members. There are no rigid boundaries between tribes and border disputes are not uncommon.</p><p>Alignments of tribe members are similar to the alignment of the leader. A tribe that has a leader who is neutral good may have neutral good, chaotic good, lawful good, and true neutral members. A predominantly evil tribe does not recognize boundaries with other tribes and treats other tribes as inferior beings to be eliminated.</p><p>Athasian aarakocra aren't happy in enclosed spaces, but they they take refuge in a cave or building if necessary.</p><p>Nonevil tribes live in rocky aeries in the highest peaks they can find. Evil tribes are normally nomadic and use an aerie made by another tribe if they need to remain in an area for a long time, even if they have to evict the tribe that made the nest.</p><p>Aarakocra aren't friendly toward intruders in their territory, especially caravans. They try to extract a toll from the caravan for passage through the desert. Good-aligned tribes allow unhindered passage of caravans that pay a tribute. If someone refuses to pay the tribute, the aarakocra try to capture scouts or outriders from the party and hold them until an even larger tribute is paid. The payment may be either livestock or shiny objects. Aarakocra are smart enough not to be taken in by glass baubles instead of gems, although they cannot tell the difference between the more common gems and the rare ones.</p><p>Evil tribes ask for tribute and often attack a caravan whether it pays or not. Aarakocra always demand shiny objects such as stones. These tribes find humans and demihumans to be quite tasty and prefer them to other food.</p><p>Good-aligned tribes of aarakocra sometimes return a lost traveler to the edge of the desert after first removing any valuables the traveler may be carrying. On very rare occasions a tribe might return a lost group of travelers to the more frequently traveled parts of the desert, again after first taking any valuables as payment.</p><p>The oldest male is the leader of the tribal hunting party and has 4+4 Hit Dice. The oldest female is in charge of the tribal aerie and has 3+3 HD. In tribes that have more than 15 members, the next oldest aarakocra serves as shaman and has 3+3 HD; the shaman completes the triumvirate necessary for proper worship and the summoning of elementals. (Interestingly, no magic-using aarakocra has ever been recorded.) Tribes without a shaman cannot summon <a href=\"/appendix/element1\">air elementals</a>, which is an important part of aarakocra culture.</p><p>The shaman is the leader of the daily sun worship. Aarakocra worship the sun because it provides them with the thermals they need to soar in search of food. The shaman also leads the mystic rituals used to summon an air elemental. Summoning an air elemental is usually done only in preparation for the tribe's most sacred ceremony, the hunt. Small tribes must band together for this ceremony to allow the triumvirate to be formed.</p><p>The ceremony to summon an air elemental must be conducted at dawn and requires the oldest male and female to emit a highpitched keening whistle. The shaman conducts an intricate dance around them, simultaneously chanting an ancient summoning mantra.</p><p>The hunt is the final part of the initiation of adolescent aarakocra to adulthood and often takes the tribe far from their normal teritory. The target is always a <a href=\"/appendix/drakalsi\">silt drake</a>. The hunt is the only time the females leave the relative safety of the nest. Even an evil tribe will not interfere with a tribe on a hunt. An air elemental is often summoned to help find the drake, but never takes part in the actual combat. Although the adult members of the tribe take part in the initial phases of the combat, it is the initiates who deliver the final, killing blows to me drake. Scars from the hunt are considered a mark of pride among all aarakocra.</p><p>The females spend about eight months of the year incubating their eggs. Athasian aarakocra mate for life and a pair normally produces as many as 10 offspring. A female lays one egg a year. Constant incubation is not required because of the high daytime temperatures, so the females can maintain the nest and keep the tribe's treasure in order.</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Ecology:</b> Athasian aarakocra are high on the food chain and have no natural enemies other than <a href=\"/appendix/drakatha\">drakes</a>. Unless evil, aarakocra leave their own territory only to hunt the silt drake and return as soon as possible when the hunt is over. (Evil aarakocra attack others, as noted above.) Aarakocra eggs and hatchlings are sought after by wealthy land owners who wish to use the creatures as scouts and sentries. An egg can bring as much as 10 cp in Tyr's marketplace. Tribes that have had eggs or hatchlings stolen have long memories and sometimes take revenge against the thief at a later date. Captive aarakocra join any tribe they come in contact with.</p><p>Athasian aarakocra have a natural life span of 21-30 years.</p>\n","images":["<img src=\"grf/ds.gif\" width=\"150\" height=\"75\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Dark Sun\" title=\"Dark Sun\" align=\"right\">","<img src=\"img/aarakath.gif\" alt=\"Aarakocra (Athas)\" title=\"Aarakocra (Athas)\" border=\"0\" width=\"300\" height=\"360\" style=\"text-align:right;\" align=\"right\">","<img src=\"grf/add2_01.gif\" width=\"200\" height=\"56\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Advanced Dungeons & Dragons 2nd Edition\">"],"setting":"Dark Sun","statblock":{"Aarakocra (Athas)":{"Activity Cycle":"Day","Alignment":"Any","Armor Class":"7","Climate/Terrain":"Deep desert","Damage/Attack":"1d3/1d3 or by weapon","Diet":"Carnivore","Frequency":"Rare","Hit Dice":"2+2","Intelligence":"Average (8-10)","Magic Resistance":"Nil","Morale":"Steady (11)","Movement":"6, Fl 36 (C)","No. Appearing":"1d10","No. of Attacks":"2","Organization":"Tribal","Size":"M (20'+ wingspan)","Special Attacks":"Nil","Special Defenses":"Nil","THAC0":"17","Treasure":"Varies","XP Value":"65"}},"title":"Aarakocra (Athas)"},"sources":["2433"],"statblock_names":[],"title":"Aarakocra (Athas)","prev_key":"zygraat","next_key":"aarakocr","monster_path":"/appendix/aarakath"}}},"pageContext":{"monster_key":"memedi","monster_data":{"TSR":["2116"],"fullBody":"  <table cellspacing=\"0\" cellpadding=\"0\"><tr class=\"bk\"><th> </th><th class=\"cn\">Gendruwo</th><th class=\"cn\">Common Memedi</th></tr><tr><th>Climate/Terrain:</th><td>Any</td><td>Any</td></tr><tr><th>Frequency:</th><td>Uncommon</td><td>Uncommon</td></tr><tr><th>Organization:</th><td>Solitary</td><td>Solitary</td></tr><tr><th>Activity Cycle:</th><td>Night</td><td>Night</td></tr><tr><th>Diet:</th><td>Special</td><td>Special</td></tr><tr><th>Intelligence:</th><td>High (13-14)</td><td>Semi- to high (2-14)</td></tr><tr><th>Treasure:</th><td>Nil</td><td>Nil</td></tr><tr><th>Alignment:</th><td>Chaotic neutral or chaotic good</td><td>Neutral</td></tr><tr><th>No. Appearing:</th><td>1-3</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><th>Armor Class:</th><td>5</td><td>6</td></tr><tr><th>Movement:</th><td>24</td><td>24</td></tr><tr><th>Hit Dice:</th><td>3</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><th>THAC0:</th><td>17</td><td>19</td></tr><tr><th>No. of Attacks:</th><td>1</td><td>Nil</td></tr><tr><th>Damage/Attack:</th><td>By weapon type</td><td>Nil</td></tr><tr><th>Special Attacks:</th><td>Fear</td><td>Fear</td></tr><tr><th>Special Defenses:</th><td>+1 or better weapon to hit, invisibility, etherealness</td><td>+1 or better weapon to hit, etherealness</td></tr><tr><th>Magic Resistance:</th><td>35% (see below)</td><td>Nil</td></tr><tr><th>Size:</th><td>M (5-6' tall)</td><td>S (3-4' tall) or M (5-6' tall)</td></tr><tr><th>Morale:</th><td>Steady (11)</td><td>Average (9)</td></tr><tr><th>XP Value:</th><td>650</td><td>35</td></tr></table><p class=\"f\">The memedi include a broad variety of lesser spirits. They are responsible for many of the strange phenomena that frighten and perplex the living.</p><p>Common memedi are incorporeal beings found most often on Bawa and other southern islands, although they also have been reported elsewhere in Kara-Tur. Common memedi include djim, djangkong, panaspati, setan gundul, uwil, and wedon.</p><p>Memedi who attract the most attention are gendruwo. These playful spirits delight in causing mischief and harassing humans. Gendruwo can change their appearance at will. They have been encountered in the forms of dogs, peacocks, cattle, and lizards. Their favorite form is that of someone known by (or related to) the victim of their mischief. In their natural form, which they seldom assume, gendruwo are featureless humanoids made of shimmering, multi-colored mist.</p><p>Gendruwo, as well as all types of common memedi, speak archaic forms of the local languages in short, clipped phrases.</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Combat:</b> Any character who sees a memedi must make a successful saving throw vs. wands. If he fails, he responds as if he has been affected by a <i>fear</i> spell. In other words, the victim turns and moves at his fastest possible speed away from the memedi, for six rounds. Common memedi have no other attacks or special abilities. They are, in fact, quite harmless.</p><p>Gendruwo share the common memedi's dislike of physical combat. However, in a desperate situation - e.g., if cornered or seriously threatened - gendruwo may use any available weapon to defend themselves. As soon as the danger has passed, they dispose of such weapons. Gendruwo find the use of human weaponry demeaning and distasteful.</p><p>Kidnapping is the gendruwo's most dangerous ability. The spirits can enter the Ethereal Plane at will, and they can take one human victim with them to the border ethereal. In order to kidnap a victim from the Prime Material Plane, the gendruwo must offer him a morsel of food, such as a bit of meat or a piece of kastera (sweet sponge cake), usually presented on a silver tray. If the victim accepts the food, the gendruwo can then whisk him away to the border ethereal, far from friends, home, and family. A kidnapped victim cannot escape the grasp of a gendruwo, and no saving throw is allowed. Once in the border ethereal, the victim is released while the gendruwo returns to the Prime Material Plane to continue its harassment of humans. The kidnapped victim must find his own way home.</p><p>Gendruwo have a magic resistance of 35%. However, this does not apply to spells specifically intended for spirits. For instance, gendruwo are resistant to <i>hail of stone</i> but not to <i>abjure</i>.</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Habitat/Society:</b> Gendruwo have no permanent lairs, though they take refuge on the Ethereal Plane when threatened or harmed. Gendruwo are solitary by nature, but sometimes congregate in small groups to execute especially devious pranks. Most often they appear after dark, in lonely, secluded places.</p><p>The pranks of gendruwo usually are annoying but harmless. For instance, they may give travelers the wrong directions or appear unexpectedly to startle the inattentive. If a gendruwo's prank possibly could result in harm - e.g., if false instructions lead a traveler into a valley of monsters - the gendruwo may appear later to inquire about the victim's health and offer assistance.</p><p>When a gendruwo is in a dark or devilish mood, however, its pranks tend to be mean-spirited if not downright dangerous. For example, it may appear before a human in the form of a trusted friend and proceed to tell vicious lies, such as &ldquo;your wife has left you&rdquo; or &ldquo;your brother has been murdered.&rdquo;</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Ecology:</b> Gendruwo eat all kinds of food and drink. Fearful humans sometimes leave generous offerings of food on the outskirts of their villages in hopes of keeping gendruwo away. Gendruwo also consume all types of paper and parchment. They enjoyannoying humans by eating crucial documents and books.</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Djim</b></p><p class=\"ni\">Djim are spirits of deceased priests, typically appearing as elderly, bald men wearing long prayer robes. Djim never make eye contact with humans or communicate with them directly. Instead, djim continually mumble chants and prayers in an archaic form of the local tongue.</p><p>Djim attend the funeral services of nobles and other wealthy men, to ensure safe passage of the deceased to the spirit world. However, they appear at the funeral only if the ceremony is performed exactly as prescribed. Local custom may dictate certain variations, but in general, djim prefer that the family follows these steps:</p><ul><li>After the deceased has drawn his final breath, the body is laid out on a special tatami mat upon which a living person has never set foot. The body is then covered by a silken shroud with the head exposed.</li><li>The eldest son places a coin in a bowl, covers it with a silken cloth, then takes it to the nearest stream or pool. He throws a lighted candle and a handful of rice into the water, removes the cloth, and throws in the coin. Now having &ldquo;purchased&rdquo; the water, he fills his bowl from the stream.</li><li>The eldest son uncovers the feet of the body, washes them with the &ldquo;purchased&rdquo; water, then covers them with the shroud.</li><li>The entire household, along with the deceased's friends and associates, bare their feet, and express their sorrow by chanting, wailing, and moaning for a period not less than one hour.</li><li>The shroud is removed. A twig is placed in the body's right hand and a fan is placed in the left hand; these are to sweep away evil spirits. The family places rings, bracelets, and other jewelry on the deceased, so that he makes a good impression when he enters the afterlife.</li><li>The eldest son prepares several pieces of spirit money, called fang lu ch'ien. Each fang lu ch'ien is a round piece of paper in the shape of a coin, usually blue in color. On the day of the funeral, the fang lu ch'ien are scattered behind the procession. The sound of chanted mumbles heralds the arrival of a djim, who appears several yards behind the procession, collecting the scattered fang lu ch'ien. The appearance of the djim and his acceptance of the fang lu ch'ien ensures that the deceased's passage to the spirit world will be a safe one.</li></ul><p>Djim are neither violent nor malicious. If attacked, they simply vanish, never to return to that particular area.</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Djangkong</b></p>  <p class=\"ni\">Djangkong take the form of a human skeleton with translucent bones and teeth made of black glass. When a human of good alignment is buried in an isolated area, djangkong sometimes appear in order to keep the deceased from becoming lonely.</p><p>Djangkong choose their haunts carefully. The ideal spot is a well-constructed crypt far from human settlements, preferably sheltered by tall trees. To attract the djangkong, carvings of animals native to the area should be placed in a line that leads to the crypt. Each corner of the crypt should be marked by a small stone bearing the name of the deceased; these markers, called tse' stones, define the area as a home for the dead.</p><p>The crypt itself should have the shape of a box or pyramid. It should contain a large grave marker made of granite or marble, and the marker must be in the south side of the crypt. Two arm chairs made of stone should stand side by side, their backs to the grave marker. The djangkong sits in one of these stone chairs, and the spirit of the deceased sits in the other.</p><p>To keep a djangkong happy, the family of the deceased must make a special offering at the crypt each year, during the first two weeks of April. The offering must include a variety of meats and vegetables, a sack of gold and silver coins, a bundle of incense sticks, a broom, and hoe. The djangkong will use the broom and hoe to rid the area of weeds and keep it clean. As long as the djangkong stays happy and remains in the crypt, the area bounded by the tse' stones is permanently charmed by <i>protection from evil</i>.</p><p></p><p class=\"f\"><b>Panaspati</b></p>  <p class=\"ni\">The panaspati is a grotesque memedi resembling a human body with its head between its legs. The creature walks on its hands and breathes fire. The fire appears to be normal, but it generates no heat and causes no damage.</p><p>Humans often summon a panaspati to frighten or intimidate their enemies. Two adult humans must summon the spirit creature; one alone will not suffice. If the panaspati appears (10% chance per day) and both humans resist its fear (i.e., they don't run away), the panaspati asks for an offering of food and coins. If the panaspati rejects their offering, it vanishes, and the humans lose all their body hair. (It will grow again normally, however.) If the spirit accepts the offering, it asks the humans whom they wish to frighten. The panaspati will then harass the selected victim for a full day, after which it disappears.</p><p></p><p class=\"f\"><b>Setan Gundul</b></p>  <p class=\"ni\">The setan gundul appears as a small child whose head has been completely shaved, except for a topknot. This spirit is the only type of memedi that cannot speak.</p><p>Setan gundul can be summoned only by an unmarried woman who is at least 80 years old. The woman summons the spirit by falling into a trance for two full days, after which the setan gundul appears. The spirit holds a brass mirror in its hands. Any person who resists the setan gundul's fear attack, and then gazes into its mirror, sees an omen of his future (e.g., a violent death, rich treasure, or great honor). The setan gundul seldom stays for more than a day, usually arriving after sunset and leaving before dawn. However, it may linger for longer periods if it receives tributes of food and is treated with kindness.</p><p></p><p class=\"f\"><b>Uwil</b></p>  <p class=\"ni\">Uwil are derived from the spirit of dead sohei. They are the most intelligent of all memedi, and also cooperate most fully with humans. Men often seek their advice. Uwil always walk with their heads held downward because their brains are so heavy.</p><p>Uwil reside far from human civilizations, usually in caves and underground tunnels. They always are accompanied by 1-4 pure white <a href=\"/appendix/bat\">bats</a>, which offer companionship. The uwil's bats are like normal bats in every respect, except they eat only stalactites. Uwil will converse with a human who treats them with respect, especially if he brings special food for the bats, such as gemencrusted stalactites.</p><p></p><p class=\"f\"><b>Wedon</b></p>  <p class=\"ni\">Wedon resemble humans who are covered in white silken sheets from head to toe. These spirits are perhaps the most feared of all memedi, as they are considered to be omens of death, destruction, and misery. The appearance of a flock of sparrows or loons usually foreshadows the wedon's arrival. Wise humans respond to these omens by moving to another location, seeking the aid of a priest or other holy man, or by praying to the gods for redemption. However, should the birds linger in the area or pursue any fleeing humans, the arrival of a wedon is inevitable. Any person who sees a wedon must make a successful save vs. wands or flee.</p>\n","images":["<img src=\"grf/kt.gif\" width=\"150\" height=\"75\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Kara-Tur (Forgotten Realms)\" title=\"Kara-Tur (Forgotten Realms)\" align=\"right\">","<img src=\"img/memedi.gif\" alt=\"Memedi\" title=\"Memedi\" border=\"0\" width=\"300\" height=\"360\" style=\"text-align:right;\" align=\"right\">","<img src=\"grf/add2_01.gif\" width=\"200\" height=\"56\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Advanced Dungeons & Dragons 2nd Edition\">"],"setting":"Kara-Tur (Forgotten Realms)","statblock":{"Common Memedi":{"Activity Cycle":"Night","Alignment":"Neutral","Armor Class":"6","Climate/Terrain":"Any","Damage/Attack":"Nil","Diet":"Special","Frequency":"Uncommon","Hit Dice":"1","Intelligence":"Semi- to high (2-14)","Magic Resistance":"Nil","Morale":"Average (9)","Movement":"24","No. Appearing":"1","No. of Attacks":"Nil","Organization":"Solitary","Size":"S (3-4' tall) or M (5-6' tall)","Special Attacks":"Fear","Special Defenses":"+1 or better weapon to hit, etherealness","THAC0":"19","Treasure":"Nil","XP Value":"35"},"Gendruwo":{"Activity Cycle":"Night","Alignment":"Chaotic neutral or chaotic good","Armor Class":"5","Climate/Terrain":"Any","Damage/Attack":"By weapon type","Diet":"Special","Frequency":"Uncommon","Hit Dice":"3","Intelligence":"High (13-14)","Magic Resistance":"35% (see below)","Morale":"Steady (11)","Movement":"24","No. Appearing":"1-3","No. of Attacks":"1","Organization":"Solitary","Size":"M (5-6' tall)","Special Attacks":"Fear","Special Defenses":"+1 or better weapon to hit, invisibility, etherealness","THAC0":"17","Treasure":"Nil","XP Value":"650"}},"title":"Memedi"},"sources":["2116"],"statblock_names":[],"title":"Memedi","prev_key":"mek","next_key":"mememori","monster_path":"/appendix/memedi"}},"staticQueryHashes":[],"slicesMap":{}}
