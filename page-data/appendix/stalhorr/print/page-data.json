While the powers listed above are the most common, some aarakocra have different or additional powers.</p><p class=\"f\">A race of intelligent, birdlike creatures living in the deepest deserts of Athas, the rare Athasian <a href=\"/appendix/aarakocr\">aarakocra</a> spends its time soaring on thermals in search of food.</p><p>The aarakocra is 7 to 8 feet tall with a wingspan of 20 feet or more. Because of its large wingspan, an aarakocra can carry as much as 75% of its own body weight and still fly easily. An aarakocra can fly a short distance carrying a burden equaling 125% of its own body weight. The average body weight of a full grown male is 100 pounds and a female is 85 pounds.</p><p>Each wing has a &ldquo;hand&rdquo; at its midpoint, consisting of three fingers and an opposable thumb. The fourth finger forms the rigid leading edge of the wing. In flight the hands cannot be used, but on the ground the aarakocra can use its hands almost as a human would. The aarakocra's body is protected by a thin bony plate on the chest, much like a solid rib cage. Talons on its legs can be used as claws and can be retracted to reveal a second set of hands, also with three fingers and an opposable thumb. Except for the chest plate, the entire skeleton is hollow and extremely fragile.</p><p>From a distance, the Athasian aarakocra resembles a huge <a href=\"/appendix/bird\">vulture</a>. Its black eyes, set in the front of the head, provide excellent vision over a long range. The plumage is generally black with a white collar for adult males and black or brown with a smaller white collar for females. Adolescents are a mixture of brown and black. The beak is large and covers most of the head. Plumage begins at the crown of the head and is darker near the head, except for the collar. Athasian aarakocra speak their own language and the languages of vultures and other large birds. Some speak the common tongue (5% to 10% chance depending on how deep in the wastelands a tribe lives).</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Combat:</b> Aarakocra can fight in the air or on the ground. They prefer aerial combat since their bones are too fragile to withstand a solid blow from a human-sized opponent. In combat against creatures on the ground, they prefer to fly over their victim and drop weighted nets. Some aarakocra use darts to harass ground-based opponents.</p><p>If their opponents can fly, the aarakocra generally forgo the use of the net, although large groups sometimes use nets on flying creatures. Normally, aarakocra attack flying creatures with long spears, diving from above and allowing the momentum to carry the spear through the target. Such an attack doubles the damage if the aarakocra have been able to dive at least 50 feet. Only the very largest aarakocra can carry more than one of these spears, they can attack with both at once with no penalty, causing double damage on each strike. All diving attacks are made at +4 and should be treated as a charge attack. All other penalties and restrictions of charge attacks apply.</p><p>The effect of the aarakocra's nets depends on if the opponent is flying at the time it becomes entangled. Creatures on the ground that are hit by a net are entangled and unable to participate in any combat until they make a successful Strength check to get free of the net. Flying creatures hit by a net can no longer fly and immediately begin falling. If they cannot escape the net or use some magical means to arrest the fall, normal falling damage applies.</p><p>Unless victims are entangled in nets, aarakocra are cautious in ground combat. If the aarakocra outnumber their opponents they advance in a straight line and thrust with their spears. If outnumbered, or the opponents are particularly tough, the aarakocra withdraw. Victims entangled in nets are killed or incapacitated for use as food or ransom.</p><p>Athasian aarakocra are mindful of their physical limitations as well as their comparatively low psionic abilities. They do not normally initiate psionic combat. At the first sign of psionic powers from any of their victims, however, all aarakocra that have some ability will use whatever attack and defense modes they can in an attempt to destroy the threat. Large groups of is or more aarakocra may initiate psionic combat if their leaders feel they can win quickly and avoid physical combat.</p><p>In desperation, an aarakocra can attempt to bite an opponent in combat. Because of the unwieldiness of its beak, the aarakocra has a THAC0 of 18 if attacking with this appendage. Further, the birdman causes only 1d2 points of damage with the beak.</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Habitat/Society:</b> Athasian aarakocra live in tribes with 6-20 (2d8+4) members, depending on the prestige of the leader. The largest tribe ever recorded had 50 members. The tribal hunting territory depends on the size of the tribe, usually about 500 square miles for a tribe of 10 members. There are no rigid boundaries between tribes and border disputes are not uncommon.</p><p>Alignments of tribe members are similar to the alignment of the leader. A tribe that has a leader who is neutral good may have neutral good, chaotic good, lawful good, and true neutral members. A predominantly evil tribe does not recognize boundaries with other tribes and treats other tribes as inferior beings to be eliminated.</p><p>Athasian aarakocra aren't happy in enclosed spaces, but they they take refuge in a cave or building if necessary.</p><p>Nonevil tribes live in rocky aeries in the highest peaks they can find. Evil tribes are normally nomadic and use an aerie made by another tribe if they need to remain in an area for a long time, even if they have to evict the tribe that made the nest.</p><p>Aarakocra aren't friendly toward intruders in their territory, especially caravans. They try to extract a toll from the caravan for passage through the desert. Good-aligned tribes allow unhindered passage of caravans that pay a tribute. If someone refuses to pay the tribute, the aarakocra try to capture scouts or outriders from the party and hold them until an even larger tribute is paid. The payment may be either livestock or shiny objects. Aarakocra are smart enough not to be taken in by glass baubles instead of gems, although they cannot tell the difference between the more common gems and the rare ones.</p><p>Evil tribes ask for tribute and often attack a caravan whether it pays or not. Aarakocra always demand shiny objects such as stones. These tribes find humans and demihumans to be quite tasty and prefer them to other food.</p><p>Good-aligned tribes of aarakocra sometimes return a lost traveler to the edge of the desert after first removing any valuables the traveler may be carrying. On very rare occasions a tribe might return a lost group of travelers to the more frequently traveled parts of the desert, again after first taking any valuables as payment.</p><p>The oldest male is the leader of the tribal hunting party and has 4+4 Hit Dice. The oldest female is in charge of the tribal aerie and has 3+3 HD. In tribes that have more than 15 members, the next oldest aarakocra serves as shaman and has 3+3 HD; the shaman completes the triumvirate necessary for proper worship and the summoning of elementals. (Interestingly, no magic-using aarakocra has ever been recorded.) Tribes without a shaman cannot summon <a href=\"/appendix/element1\">air elementals</a>, which is an important part of aarakocra culture.</p><p>The shaman is the leader of the daily sun worship. Aarakocra worship the sun because it provides them with the thermals they need to soar in search of food. The shaman also leads the mystic rituals used to summon an air elemental. Summoning an air elemental is usually done only in preparation for the tribe's most sacred ceremony, the hunt. Small tribes must band together for this ceremony to allow the triumvirate to be formed.</p><p>The ceremony to summon an air elemental must be conducted at dawn and requires the oldest male and female to emit a highpitched keening whistle. The shaman conducts an intricate dance around them, simultaneously chanting an ancient summoning mantra.</p><p>The hunt is the final part of the initiation of adolescent aarakocra to adulthood and often takes the tribe far from their normal teritory. The target is always a <a href=\"/appendix/drakalsi\">silt drake</a>. The hunt is the only time the females leave the relative safety of the nest. Even an evil tribe will not interfere with a tribe on a hunt. An air elemental is often summoned to help find the drake, but never takes part in the actual combat. Although the adult members of the tribe take part in the initial phases of the combat, it is the initiates who deliver the final, killing blows to me drake. Scars from the hunt are considered a mark of pride among all aarakocra.</p><p>The females spend about eight months of the year incubating their eggs. Athasian aarakocra mate for life and a pair normally produces as many as 10 offspring. A female lays one egg a year. Constant incubation is not required because of the high daytime temperatures, so the females can maintain the nest and keep the tribe's treasure in order.</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Ecology:</b> Athasian aarakocra are high on the food chain and have no natural enemies other than <a href=\"/appendix/drakatha\">drakes</a>. Unless evil, aarakocra leave their own territory only to hunt the silt drake and return as soon as possible when the hunt is over. (Evil aarakocra attack others, as noted above.) Aarakocra eggs and hatchlings are sought after by wealthy land owners who wish to use the creatures as scouts and sentries. An egg can bring as much as 10 cp in Tyr's marketplace. Tribes that have had eggs or hatchlings stolen have long memories and sometimes take revenge against the thief at a later date. Captive aarakocra join any tribe they come in contact with.</p><p>Athasian aarakocra have a natural life span of 21-30 years.</p><p></p><br clear=\"all\" style=\"clear:both; height:0;\">\r\n","images":["<img src=\"grf/ds.gif\" width=\"150\" height=\"75\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Dark Sun\" title=\"Dark Sun\" align=\"right\">","<img src=\"img/aarakath.gif\" alt=\"Aarakocra (Athas)\" title=\"Aarakocra (Athas)\" border=\"0\" width=\"300\" height=\"360\" style=\"text-align:right;\" align=\"right\">","<img src=\"grf/add2_01.gif\" width=\"200\" height=\"56\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Advanced Dungeons & Dragons 2nd Edition\">"],"setting":"Dark Sun","statblock":{"Aarakocra (Athas)":{"Activity Cycle":"Day","Alignment":"Any","Armor Class":"7","Climate/Terrain":"Deep desert","Damage/Attack":"1d3/1d3 or by weapon","Diet":"Carnivore","Frequency":"Rare","Hit Dice":"2+2","Intelligence":"Average (8-10)","Magic Resistance":"Nil","Morale":"Steady (11)","Movement":"6, Fl 36 (C)","No. Appearing":"1d10","No. of Attacks":"2","Organization":"Tribal","Size":"M (20'+ wingspan)","Special Attacks":"Nil","Special Defenses":"Nil","THAC0":"17","Treasure":"Varies","XP Value":"65"}},"title":"Aarakocra (Athas)"},"sources":["2433"],"statblock_names":[],"title":"Aarakocra (Athas)","prev_key":"zygraat","next_key":"aarakocr","monster_path":"/appendix/aarakath"}}},"pageContext":{"monster_key":"stalhorr","monster_data":{"TSR":["2433"],"fullBody":"  <table cellspacing=\"0\" cellpadding=\"0\"><tr><th>Climate/Terrain:</th><td>Any</td></tr><tr><th>Frequency:</th><td>Very rare</td></tr><tr><th>Organization:</th><td>Solitary</td></tr><tr><th>Activity Cycle:</th><td>Night</td></tr><tr><th>Diet:</th><td>Omnivore</td></tr><tr><th>Intelligence:</th><td>Average (8-10)</td></tr><tr><th>Treasure:</th><td>Nil (E)</td></tr><tr><th>Alignment:</th><td>Chaotic evil</td></tr><tr><th>No. Appearing:</th><td>1</td></tr><tr><th>Armor Class:</th><td>-3</td></tr><tr><th>Movement:</th><td>12</td></tr><tr><th>Hit Dice:</th><td>18</td></tr><tr><th>THAC0:</th><td>3</td></tr><tr><th>No. of Attacks:</th><td>7</td></tr><tr><th>Damage/Attack:</th><td>2-16 (&times;7)</td></tr><tr><th>Special Attacks:</th><td>Psionics, spells, constriction, bite</td></tr><tr><th>Special Defenses:</th><td>+1 or better to hit, spell immunity, invisibility</td></tr><tr><th>Magic Resistance:</th><td>25%</td></tr><tr><th>Size:</th><td>H (25' tall)</td></tr><tr><th>Morale:</th><td>Elite (15-16)</td></tr><tr><th>XP Value:</th><td>12,000</td></tr></table><p class=\"f\"><b>Psionics Summary</b></p><table class=\"ip\"><tr class=\"bk\"><th>Level</th><th>Dis/Sci/Dev</th><th>Attack/Defense</th><th>Score</th><th>PSPs</th></tr><tr class=\"cn\"><td>23</td><td>4/6/17</td><td>all/all</td><td>16</td><td>75</td></tr></table><p class=\"ni\"><b>Psychokinesis -</b> <i>Sciences:</i> disintegrate, telekinesis; <i>Devotions:</i> control body, inertial barrier, molecular manipulation, opposite reaction.</p><p class=\"ni\"><b>Psychometabolism -</b> <i>Science:</i> life detection; <i>Devotions:</i> body equilibrium, displacement, ectoplasmatic form.</p><p class=\"ni\"><b>Psychoportation -</b> <i>Science:</i> summon planar creature; <i>Devotions:</i> astral projection, time shift, wrench.</p><p class=\"ni\"><b>Telepathy -</b> <i>Sciences:</i> mind link, psionic blast; <i>Devotions:</i> contact, ego whip, id insinuation, mind bar, mind thrust, psionic crush, psionic drain.</p><p class=\"f\">The stalking horror, also known as the moonbeast, is one of the most feared creatures on Athas. Few have seen one and survived to describe it. Those who escape are usually so addlebrained that their words make little sense. The only reported sightings are on clear Athasian nights when the moons are in a specific alignment. The stalking horror is believed to be the result of some ancient summoning.</p><p>The moonbeast has a large octopoid bodv with at least 10 tentacles. Within the circle of tentacles lies its tooth-filled maw. Some witnesses report at least three rows of needle-sharp fangs inside. Its bulbous body is covered with 36 eye stalks, each a foot long. They give the beast 360-degree vision. It can retract the stalks to protect its eyes as it oozes through tight spaces.</p><p>The tentacles are lined with hooks that it uses to grip and rend. They provide the primary means of locomotion for the beast. It reaches ahead with several tentacles and pulls its bulbous body behind it.</p><p>Its skin is a mottled gray and is covered with a slimy secretion. Both the slime and its amorphous body allow the beast to pull itself through openings as small as a human-sized doorway. Its tentacles, which can be up to 20 feet long, have the strength to tear apart buildings.</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Combat:</b> These monsters are absolutely devastating in combat and have been known to destroy entire towns. The remains of herds of <a href=\"/appendix/animdoa1\">kanks</a>, <a href=\"/appendix/erdland\">erdland</a>, and even <a href=\"/appendix/animdoa1\">mekillots</a> have been found completely decimated by these voracious eaters.</p><p>Though the moon beast is usually invisible, its bulk causes a great deal of noise and vibrations, making surprise nearly impossible. The stalking horror always shows its true form before attacking.</p><p>In melee, the stalking horror has many attack forms available. The beast can use as many as 7 of its tentacles to attack during melee, each causing 2-16 (2d8) points of damage per strike. Any attack four or more greater than the THAC0 indicates that the victim has been grabbed by the tentacle. It can then constrict for an additional 1-10 (1d10) points of damage per round. Any creature caught in a tentacle has a chance of having at least one limb pinned. If a creature is grabbed, roll percentile dice. The results are as follows: one arm (1-25 left, 26-50 right), no arms (51-75), or both arms (76-100) pinned. A constricted character cannot cast spells, but can attack the tentacle (if only one hand is free the character attacks at -3). The vice-like grip of the tentacles is so strong that no creature can force them open, regardless of its strength. The tentacle must be severed to free the victim. Each tentacle must suffer 12 points of damage from a slashing or piercing weapon before it is severed.</p><p>The toothy mouth of these creatures is devastating in combat, capable of causing 3-30 (3d10) points of damage per attack. The beast can only bite creatures held in its tentacles. In this case the bite is in addition to other melee attacks. Also, the stalking horror has limited magic resistance (25%) and is immune to all spells less than 3rd level.</p><p>The stalking horror has the innate ability to use defiler magic. These magical abilities require no verbal, semantic, or material components. The creature can cast <i>wall of fog</i>, <i>fog cloud</i>, <i>mirror image</i>, <i>dispel magic</i>, <i>fireball</i>, <i>lightning bolt</i>, <i>spectral force</i>, <i>(Evard's) black tentacles</i>, <i>ice storm</i>, <i>cloudkill</i>, and <i>chain lightning</i> once per day. All spells cast from the creature should be considered as cast by a 12th-level defiler. They have the appropriate effect on the surrounding terrain.</p><p>The stalking horror constantly emits an aura of <i>fear</i>. All creatures within 60 feet of the moonbeast must make a successful save vs. paralyzation or be frozen in terror. This effect lasts for 2d6 rounds, during which the victim cannot run, attack, cast spells, or use psionics.</p><p>The stalking horror also has extraordinary psionic abilities. Among its favored psionic attack forms are life draining, phobia amplification, and time shift. Frequently, the moonbeast uses the phobia amplification to intensify the horror a victim feels when affected by the aura of <i>fear</i>. Any creature subject to both attack forms, provided they fail their initial save, must make a system shock roll. Failure means the victim goes into shock and babbles incoherently for 1-6 (1d6) weeks. After this time the victim remembers nothing of the encounter with the moonbeast.</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Habitat/Society:</b> The moonbeast remains dormant for months or even years at a time. But when the moons of Athas are in the right configuration, the beast awakens from its dormancy to feed on the creatures of Athas. The moonbeast leaves its lair only at night, only to feed, and does so invisibly.</p><p>When dormant, the moonbeast uses its psionic discipline to astral project itself to its home plane. It spends all its time projecting itself where it last remembers being &ldquo;happy&rdquo;. The beast stops projecting long enough to rest and regain its PSPs, then returns to the Astral Plane. But when the moons are in the right configuration, it triggers something in the creature that brings it out of its trance to feed. It eats almost anything animal. Its diet, however, is very unusual: it eats only the bones of its victims, leaving the rest of the body behind. It wails its anger and frustration at having its physical form stranded with no means to take itself back home.</p><p>The stalking horror prefers to lair away from civilization in caves and ruins that have long been abandoned. This allows the creature the time to meditate and rest without being disturbed. Stalking horrors position their lairs in very defensible locations.</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Ecology:</b> While the stalking horror eats almost anything, it has no natural predators. Its flesh is unpalatable to beings on the Prime Material Plane. Eating the flesh of the moonbeast causes nausea and hallucinations that last 2d4 hours after which the consumer falls into a deep coma for 1d4 days. During that time the consumer has horrifying dreams of a gray and misty world with bizarre and mutated creatures that slither and crawl across the sparse landscape.</p><p>Though the flesh cannot be eaten, the hide of the creature makes excellent armor and shields. If properly treated, the hide can make leather armor with an effective AC 5. It also gives its wearer a +1 bonus on saving throws for all spells of 1st and 2nd level. Few merchants are aware of the value of the hide, since few moonbeasts have ever been killed.</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Moonbeast Magical Items</b></p>  <p class=\"ni\">The moonbeast also stalks prey that have magical items strongly linked to the beast's summoning. Each horror has at least one item to which it is bonded. These items can range from jewelry to weapons to sculptures, but they have several things in common. First, each item has a gemstone of not less than 500 gp value as an element of its construction. Second, these items have at least one powerful magical property, such as <i>wall of fog</i>, <i>fog cloud</i>, <i>dispel magic</i>, <i>fireball</i>, <i>lightning bolt</i>, <i>(Evard's) black tentacles</i> or <i>cloudkill</i>. This power can be used once per day. The possessor of the item has 25% magic resistance. If the item is a weapon, it may have an enchantment of as much as +2. This item cannot harm the stalking horror to which it is linked. It may, however, be used against other stalking horrors.</p><p>These items also have some horrifying side effects. The owner of the item becomes very possessive of the item. The possessor attempts to stay in physical contact with the item at all times and becomes violent if it is forcibly removed. Anyone possessing such an item gradually becomes a creature of the night. After possessing the item for one continuous month, the possessor suffers a -1 penalty to all attack rolls, ability checks, and saving throws while in sunlight. The same rolls receive a +1 bonus if the character is bathed in the light of the full moon.</p><p>Characters possessing these items may carry them for years before they discover their deadly link to a moonbeast. Once the moonbeast has awakened and sated its appetite, it seeks out and attempts to destroy the individual possessing the item. If the moonbeast succeeds, it leaves the item for someone else to find. One sage has speculated that the moonbeast leaves the item, then returns to destroy its possessor as revenge for being summoned to Athas.</p><p></p><br clear=\"all\" style=\"clear:both; height:0;\">\r\n","images":["<img src=\"grf/ds.gif\" width=\"150\" height=\"75\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Dark Sun\" title=\"Dark Sun\" align=\"right\">","<img src=\"img/stalhorr.gif\" alt=\"Stalking Horror\" title=\"Stalking Horror\" border=\"0\" width=\"300\" height=\"360\" style=\"text-align:right;\" align=\"right\">","<img src=\"grf/add2_01.gif\" width=\"200\" height=\"56\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Advanced Dungeons & Dragons 2nd Edition\">"],"setting":"Dark Sun","statblock":{"Stalking Horror":{"Activity Cycle":"Night","Alignment":"Chaotic evil","Armor Class":"-3","Climate/Terrain":"Any","Damage/Attack":"2-16 (&times;7)","Diet":"Omnivore","Frequency":"Very rare","Hit Dice":"18","Intelligence":"Average (8-10)","Magic Resistance":"25%","Morale":"Elite (15-16)","Movement":"12","No. Appearing":"1","No. of Attacks":"7","Organization":"Solitary","Size":"H (25' tall)","Special Attacks":"Psionics, spells, constriction, bite","Special Defenses":"+1 or better to hit, spell immunity, invisibility","THAC0":"3","Treasure":"Nil (E)","XP Value":"12,000"}},"title":"Stalking Horror"},"sources":["2433"],"statblock_names":[],"title":"Stalking Horror","prev_key":"staldeat","next_key":"stargaze","monster_path":"/appendix/stalhorr"}},"staticQueryHashes":[],"slicesMap":{}}
