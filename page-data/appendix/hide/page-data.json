In basic appearance, it resembles a dirty floor mop or an opened umbrella, and in general is quite a disgusting sight. It can be of any color, changing hues frequently.</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Combat:</b> The hide will try to get close enough to a victim to bite it, its beak inflicting 2-12 hp damage. In order to disable a target so it can close in for the kill, it generates a cone of cold 10' wide and 30' long, which causes 3d6 hp damage. As a side effect, it is immune to all cold-based attacks, but if the battle goes against it anyway, and it loses three-quarters of its hit points, it can cover its retreat with the same sort of blinding cloud the <a href=\"/appendix/octojell\">octo-jelly</a> produces. The dimensions of this creature cloud, though, are 40' high by 60' wide by 60' long.</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Habitat/Society:</b> These creatures are solitary, due to the virtual impossibility of the deep sea providing enough food for more than one in a small area. The mating season is brief, and the eggs are abandoned as soon as they are laid.</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Ecology:</b> The hide has the same uses to both Man and Nature as the octojelly. In the natural world, it preys on both swimmers and bottom-crawlers, while its ink has the same value as a scroll-ink ingredient.</p><br clear=\"all\" style=\"clear:both; height:0;\">\r\n","images":["<img src=\"grf/dr.gif\" width=\"150\" height=\"75\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Dragon Magazine\" title=\"Dragon Magazine\" align=\"right\">","<img src=\"img/hide.gif\" alt=\"Hide\" title=\"Hide\" border=\"0\" width=\"300\" height=\"360\" style=\"text-align:right;\" align=\"right\">","<img src=\"grf/add2_01.gif\" width=\"200\" height=\"56\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Advanced Dungeons & Dragons 2nd Edition\">"],"setting":"Dragon Magazine","statblock":{"Hide":{"Activity Cycle":"Any","Alignment":"Neutral","Armor Class":"1","Climate/Terrain":"Ocean depths","Damage/Attack":"2-12","Diet":"Carnivore","Frequency":"Very rare","Hit Dice":"8","Intelligence":"Animal (1)","Magic Resistance":"Standard","Morale":"Fearless (20)","Movement":"3, swim 12","No. Appearing":"1","No. of Attacks":"1","Organization":"Solitary","Size":"Huge (20' across)","Special Attacks":"Cold generation","Special Defenses":"Luminous cloud, immunity to cold","THAC0":"13","Treasure":"Nil","XP Value":"3,000"}},"title":"Hide"},"sources":["Dragon#235"],"statblock_names":[],"title":"Hide","prev_key":"heway","next_key":"hippcamp"}},"staticQueryHashes":[],"slicesMap":{}}
