While the powers listed above are the most common, some aarakocra have different or additional powers.</p><p class=\"f\">A race of intelligent, birdlike creatures living in the deepest deserts of Athas, the rare Athasian <a href=\"/appendix/aarakocr\">aarakocra</a> spends its time soaring on thermals in search of food.</p><p>The aarakocra is 7 to 8 feet tall with a wingspan of 20 feet or more. Because of its large wingspan, an aarakocra can carry as much as 75% of its own body weight and still fly easily. An aarakocra can fly a short distance carrying a burden equaling 125% of its own body weight. The average body weight of a full grown male is 100 pounds and a female is 85 pounds.</p><p>Each wing has a &ldquo;hand&rdquo; at its midpoint, consisting of three fingers and an opposable thumb. The fourth finger forms the rigid leading edge of the wing. In flight the hands cannot be used, but on the ground the aarakocra can use its hands almost as a human would. The aarakocra's body is protected by a thin bony plate on the chest, much like a solid rib cage. Talons on its legs can be used as claws and can be retracted to reveal a second set of hands, also with three fingers and an opposable thumb. Except for the chest plate, the entire skeleton is hollow and extremely fragile.</p><p>From a distance, the Athasian aarakocra resembles a huge <a href=\"/appendix/bird\">vulture</a>. Its black eyes, set in the front of the head, provide excellent vision over a long range. The plumage is generally black with a white collar for adult males and black or brown with a smaller white collar for females. Adolescents are a mixture of brown and black. The beak is large and covers most of the head. Plumage begins at the crown of the head and is darker near the head, except for the collar. Athasian aarakocra speak their own language and the languages of vultures and other large birds. Some speak the common tongue (5% to 10% chance depending on how deep in the wastelands a tribe lives).</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Combat:</b> Aarakocra can fight in the air or on the ground. They prefer aerial combat since their bones are too fragile to withstand a solid blow from a human-sized opponent. In combat against creatures on the ground, they prefer to fly over their victim and drop weighted nets. Some aarakocra use darts to harass ground-based opponents.</p><p>If their opponents can fly, the aarakocra generally forgo the use of the net, although large groups sometimes use nets on flying creatures. Normally, aarakocra attack flying creatures with long spears, diving from above and allowing the momentum to carry the spear through the target. Such an attack doubles the damage if the aarakocra have been able to dive at least 50 feet. Only the very largest aarakocra can carry more than one of these spears, they can attack with both at once with no penalty, causing double damage on each strike. All diving attacks are made at +4 and should be treated as a charge attack. All other penalties and restrictions of charge attacks apply.</p><p>The effect of the aarakocra's nets depends on if the opponent is flying at the time it becomes entangled. Creatures on the ground that are hit by a net are entangled and unable to participate in any combat until they make a successful Strength check to get free of the net. Flying creatures hit by a net can no longer fly and immediately begin falling. If they cannot escape the net or use some magical means to arrest the fall, normal falling damage applies.</p><p>Unless victims are entangled in nets, aarakocra are cautious in ground combat. If the aarakocra outnumber their opponents they advance in a straight line and thrust with their spears. If outnumbered, or the opponents are particularly tough, the aarakocra withdraw. Victims entangled in nets are killed or incapacitated for use as food or ransom.</p><p>Athasian aarakocra are mindful of their physical limitations as well as their comparatively low psionic abilities. They do not normally initiate psionic combat. At the first sign of psionic powers from any of their victims, however, all aarakocra that have some ability will use whatever attack and defense modes they can in an attempt to destroy the threat. Large groups of is or more aarakocra may initiate psionic combat if their leaders feel they can win quickly and avoid physical combat.</p><p>In desperation, an aarakocra can attempt to bite an opponent in combat. Because of the unwieldiness of its beak, the aarakocra has a THAC0 of 18 if attacking with this appendage. Further, the birdman causes only 1d2 points of damage with the beak.</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Habitat/Society:</b> Athasian aarakocra live in tribes with 6-20 (2d8+4) members, depending on the prestige of the leader. The largest tribe ever recorded had 50 members. The tribal hunting territory depends on the size of the tribe, usually about 500 square miles for a tribe of 10 members. There are no rigid boundaries between tribes and border disputes are not uncommon.</p><p>Alignments of tribe members are similar to the alignment of the leader. A tribe that has a leader who is neutral good may have neutral good, chaotic good, lawful good, and true neutral members. A predominantly evil tribe does not recognize boundaries with other tribes and treats other tribes as inferior beings to be eliminated.</p><p>Athasian aarakocra aren't happy in enclosed spaces, but they they take refuge in a cave or building if necessary.</p><p>Nonevil tribes live in rocky aeries in the highest peaks they can find. Evil tribes are normally nomadic and use an aerie made by another tribe if they need to remain in an area for a long time, even if they have to evict the tribe that made the nest.</p><p>Aarakocra aren't friendly toward intruders in their territory, especially caravans. They try to extract a toll from the caravan for passage through the desert. Good-aligned tribes allow unhindered passage of caravans that pay a tribute. If someone refuses to pay the tribute, the aarakocra try to capture scouts or outriders from the party and hold them until an even larger tribute is paid. The payment may be either livestock or shiny objects. Aarakocra are smart enough not to be taken in by glass baubles instead of gems, although they cannot tell the difference between the more common gems and the rare ones.</p><p>Evil tribes ask for tribute and often attack a caravan whether it pays or not. Aarakocra always demand shiny objects such as stones. These tribes find humans and demihumans to be quite tasty and prefer them to other food.</p><p>Good-aligned tribes of aarakocra sometimes return a lost traveler to the edge of the desert after first removing any valuables the traveler may be carrying. On very rare occasions a tribe might return a lost group of travelers to the more frequently traveled parts of the desert, again after first taking any valuables as payment.</p><p>The oldest male is the leader of the tribal hunting party and has 4+4 Hit Dice. The oldest female is in charge of the tribal aerie and has 3+3 HD. In tribes that have more than 15 members, the next oldest aarakocra serves as shaman and has 3+3 HD; the shaman completes the triumvirate necessary for proper worship and the summoning of elementals. (Interestingly, no magic-using aarakocra has ever been recorded.) Tribes without a shaman cannot summon <a href=\"/appendix/element1\">air elementals</a>, which is an important part of aarakocra culture.</p><p>The shaman is the leader of the daily sun worship. Aarakocra worship the sun because it provides them with the thermals they need to soar in search of food. The shaman also leads the mystic rituals used to summon an air elemental. Summoning an air elemental is usually done only in preparation for the tribe's most sacred ceremony, the hunt. Small tribes must band together for this ceremony to allow the triumvirate to be formed.</p><p>The ceremony to summon an air elemental must be conducted at dawn and requires the oldest male and female to emit a highpitched keening whistle. The shaman conducts an intricate dance around them, simultaneously chanting an ancient summoning mantra.</p><p>The hunt is the final part of the initiation of adolescent aarakocra to adulthood and often takes the tribe far from their normal teritory. The target is always a <a href=\"/appendix/drakalsi\">silt drake</a>. The hunt is the only time the females leave the relative safety of the nest. Even an evil tribe will not interfere with a tribe on a hunt. An air elemental is often summoned to help find the drake, but never takes part in the actual combat. Although the adult members of the tribe take part in the initial phases of the combat, it is the initiates who deliver the final, killing blows to me drake. Scars from the hunt are considered a mark of pride among all aarakocra.</p><p>The females spend about eight months of the year incubating their eggs. Athasian aarakocra mate for life and a pair normally produces as many as 10 offspring. A female lays one egg a year. Constant incubation is not required because of the high daytime temperatures, so the females can maintain the nest and keep the tribe's treasure in order.</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Ecology:</b> Athasian aarakocra are high on the food chain and have no natural enemies other than <a href=\"/appendix/drakatha\">drakes</a>. Unless evil, aarakocra leave their own territory only to hunt the silt drake and return as soon as possible when the hunt is over. (Evil aarakocra attack others, as noted above.) Aarakocra eggs and hatchlings are sought after by wealthy land owners who wish to use the creatures as scouts and sentries. An egg can bring as much as 10 cp in Tyr's marketplace. Tribes that have had eggs or hatchlings stolen have long memories and sometimes take revenge against the thief at a later date. Captive aarakocra join any tribe they come in contact with.</p><p>Athasian aarakocra have a natural life span of 21-30 years.</p><br clear=\"all\" style=\"clear:both; height:0;\">\r\n","images":["<img src=\"grf/ds.gif\" width=\"150\" height=\"75\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Dark Sun\" title=\"Dark Sun\" align=\"right\">","<img src=\"img/aarakath.gif\" alt=\"Aarakocra (Athas)\" title=\"Aarakocra (Athas)\" border=\"0\" width=\"300\" height=\"360\" style=\"text-align:right;\" align=\"right\">","<img src=\"grf/add2_01.gif\" width=\"200\" height=\"56\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Advanced Dungeons & Dragons 2nd Edition\">"],"setting":"Dark Sun","statblock":{"Aarakocra (Athas)":{"Activity Cycle":"Day","Alignment":"Any","Armor Class":"7","Climate/Terrain":"Deep desert","Damage/Attack":"1d3/1d3 or by weapon","Diet":"Carnivore","Frequency":"Rare","Hit Dice":"2+2","Intelligence":"Average (8-10)","Magic Resistance":"Nil","Morale":"Steady (11)","Movement":"6, Fl 36 (C)","No. Appearing":"1d10","No. of Attacks":"2","Organization":"Tribal","Size":"M (20'+ wingspan)","Special Attacks":"Nil","Special Defenses":"Nil","THAC0":"17","Treasure":"Varies","XP Value":"65"}},"title":"Aarakocra (Athas)"},"sources":["2433"],"statblock_names":[],"title":"Aarakocra (Athas)","prev_key":"zygraat","next_key":"aarakocr","monster_path":"/appendix/aarakath"}}},"pageContext":{"monster_key":"zombie","monster_data":{"TSR":["2102","2140"],"fullBody":"  <table cellspacing=\"0\" cellpadding=\"0\"><tr class=\"bk\"><th> </th><th class=\"cn\">Common</th><th class=\"cn\">Monster</th><th class=\"cn\">Ju-ju</th><th class=\"cn\">Lord</th><th class=\"cn\">Sea</th></tr><tr><th>Climate/Terrain:</th><td>Any</td><td>Any</td><td>Any</td><td>Any</td><td>Shallow water</td></tr><tr><th>Frequency:</th><td>Rare</td><td>Very rare</td><td>Very rare</td><td>Very rare</td><td>Rare</td></tr><tr><th>Organization:</th><td>None</td><td>None</td><td>None</td><td>Solitary</td><td>Pack</td></tr><tr><th>Activity Cycle:</th><td>Night</td><td>Night</td><td>Night</td><td>Night</td><td>Night</td></tr><tr><th>Diet:</th><td>None</td><td>None</td><td>None</td><td>Carrion</td><td>Scavenger</td></tr><tr><th>Intelligence:</th><td>Non- (0)</td><td>Non- (0)</td><td>Low (5-7)</td><td>Average (8-10)</td><td>Low (5-7)</td></tr><tr><th>Treasure:</th><td>Nil</td><td>Nil</td><td>Nil</td><td>A</td><td>M</td></tr><tr><th>Alignment:</th><td>Neutral</td><td>Neutral</td><td>Neutral evil</td><td>Neutral evil</td><td>Chaotic evil</td></tr><tr><th>No. Appearing:</th><td>3-24</td><td>1-6</td><td>1-4</td><td>1</td><td>2-24</td></tr><tr><th>Armor Class:</th><td>8</td><td>6</td><td>6</td><td>6</td><td>7</td></tr><tr><th>Movement:</th><td>6</td><td>9</td><td>9</td><td>6</td><td>6, Sw 12</td></tr><tr><th>Hit Dice:</th><td>2</td><td>6</td><td>3+12</td><td>6</td><td>5</td></tr><tr><th>THAC0:</th><td>19</td><td>15</td><td>15</td><td>15</td><td>15</td></tr><tr><th>No. of Attacks:</th><td>1</td><td>1</td><td>1</td><td>2</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><th>Damage/Attack:</th><td>1-8</td><td>4-16</td><td>3-12</td><td>2-8/2-8</td><td>1-10</td></tr><tr><th>Special Attacks:</th><td>Nil</td><td>Nil</td><td>See below</td><td>See below</td><td>Stench, disease, spell use</td></tr><tr><th>Special Defenses:</th><td>Spell immunity</td><td>Spell immunity</td><td>Spell immunity</td><td>Spell immunity</td><td>Spell immunity</td></tr><tr><th>Magic Resistance:</th><td>See below</td><td>See below</td><td>See below</td><td>Nil</td><td>Nil</td></tr><tr><th>Size:</th><td>M (6')</td><td>L (8-12')</td><td>M (6')</td><td>M (6')</td><td>M (6')</td></tr><tr><th>Morale:</th><td>Special</td><td>Special</td><td>Special</td><td>Average (8-10)</td><td>Fearless (19-20)</td></tr><tr><th>XP Value:</th><td>65</td><td>650</td><td>975</td><td>650</td><td>420</td></tr></table><p class=\"f\">Zombies are mindless, animated corpses controlled by their creators, usually evil wizards or priests.</p><p>The condition of the corpse is not changed by the animating spell. If the body was missing a limb, the zombie created from it would be missing the same limb. Since it is difficult to get fresh bodies, most zombies are in sorry shape, usually missing hair and flesh, and sometimes even bones. This affects their movement, making it jerky and uneven. Usually zombies wear the clothing they died (or were buried) in. The rotting stench from a zombie might be noticeable up to 100 feet away, depending upon the condition of the body. Zombies cannot talk, being mindless, but have been known to utter a low moan when unable to complete an assigned task.</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Combat:</b> Zombies move very slowly, always striking last in a combat round. They are given only simple, single-phrase commands. They always fight until called off or destroyed, and nothing short of a priest can turn them back. They move in a straight line toward their opponents, with arms outstretched, seeking to claw or pummel their victims to death. Like most undead, zombies are immune to <i>sleep</i>, <i>charm</i>, <i>hold</i>, death magic, poisons, and cold-based spells. A vial of holy water inflicts 2-8 points of damage to a zombie.</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Habitat/Society:</b> Zombies are typically found near graveyards, dungeons, and similar charnel places. They follow the spoken commands of their creator, as given on the spot or previously, of limited length and uncomplicated meaning (a dozen simple words or so). The dead body of any humanoid creature can be made into a zombie.</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Ecology:</b> Zombies are not natural creations and have no role in ecology or nature.</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Ju-Ju Zombie</b></p><p class=\"ni\">These creatures are made when a wizard drains the life force from a man-sized humanoid creature with an <i>energy drain</i> spell. Their skin is hard, gray, and leathery. Ju-ju zombies have a spark of intelligence. A hateful light burns in their eyes, as they realize their condition and wish to destroy living things. They understand full-sentence instructions with conditions, and use simple tactics and strategies. Since they became zombies at the moment of death, their bodies tend to be in better condition. Ju-ju zombies use normal initiative rules to determine when they strike. They are dexterous enough to use normal weapons, although they must be specifically commanded to do so. These zombies can hurl weapons like javelins or spears, and can fire bows and crossbows. Their Dexterity allows them to climb walls as a thief (92%) and they strike as a 6 Hit Die monster. Ju-ju zombies are turned as specters.</p><p>The animating force of a ju-ju zombie is more strongly tied to the Negative Material plane. The result is that only +1 or better magical weapons can harm them. Regardless of the magic on the weapon, edged and cleaving weapons inflict normal damage, while blunt and piercing weapons cause half damage. In addition to normal zombie spell immunities, ju-ju zombies are immune to mind affecting spells and psionics, illusions, and to electricity and <i>magic missiles</i>. Fire causes only half damage.</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Zombie Lord</b></p><p class=\"ni\">The <a href=\"/appendix/zomblord\">zombie lord</a> is a living creature that has taken on the foul powers and abilities of the undead. They are formed on rare occasions as the result of a <i>raise dead</i> spell gone awry. Zombie lords look as they did in life, save that their skin has turned to the pale grey of death, and their flesh is rotting and decaying. The odor of vile corruption and rotting meat hangs about them, and carrion feeding insects often buzz about them to dine on the bits of flesh and ichor that drop from their bodies.</p><p>The zombie lords can speak those languages they knew in life and they seem to have a telepathic or mystical ability to converse freely with the living dead. Further, they can <i>speak with dead</i> merely by touching a corpse. Zombie lords are turned as vampires.</p><p>When forced into combat, it relies on the great strength of its two crushing fists. The odor of death surrounding the zombie lord is so potent it causes horrible effects in those who breathe it. On the first round a character comes within 30 yards, he must save vs. poison or be affected in some way. The following results are possible:</p><table class=\"ip\"><tr class=\"bk\"><th>1d6 Roll</th><th>Effect</th></tr><tr><td>1</td><td><i>Weakness</i> (as the spell).</td></tr><tr><td>2</td><td><i>Cause disease</i> (as the spell).</td></tr><tr><td>3</td><td>-1 point of Constitution.</td></tr><tr><td>4</td><td><i>Contagion</i> (as the spell).</td></tr><tr><td>5</td><td>Character unable to act for 1d4 rounds due to nausea and vomiting.</td></tr><tr><td>6</td><td>Character dies instantly and becomes a zombie under control of the zombie lord.</td></tr></table><p>All zombies within sight of the zombie lord are subject to its mental instructions. Further, the creature can use the senses of any zombie within a mile of it to learn all that is happening within a very large area.</p><p>Once per day, the zombie lord can <i>animate dead</i> to transform dead creatures into zombies. This works as described in the <i>Player's Handbook</i> except that it can be used on the living. Any living creature with fewer Hit Dice than the zombie lord can be attacked in this manner. A target who fails a saving throw vs. death is slain. In 1d4 rounds, the slain creature rises as a zombie under the zombie lord's command.</p><p>Zombie lords seek out places of death as lairs. Often, they live in old graveyards or on the site of a tremendous battle - any place there may be bodies to animate and feast upon. The mind of the zombie lord tends to focus on death and the creation of more undead. The regions around their lairs are often littered with the decaying bodies, half eaten, of those who have tried to confront the foul beast.</p><p>The zombie lord comes into being by chance, and only under certain conditions. First, an evil human must die at the hand of an undead creatures. Second, an attempt to raise the character must be made. Third, the corpse must fail its resurrection survival roll. Fourth and last, a deity of evil must show &ldquo;favor&rdquo; to the deceased, and curse him or her with the &ldquo;gift of eternal life&rdquo;. Within one week of the raise attempt, the corpse awakens as a zombie lord.</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Sea Zombie</b></p><p class=\"ni\"><a href=\"/appendix/zombsea\">Sea zombies</a> (also known as drowned ones) are the animated corpses of humans who died at sea. Although similar to land-dwelling zombies, they are free-willed and are rumored to be animated by the will of the god Nerull the Reaper (or another similar evil deity).</p><p>The appearance of drowned ones matches their name: they look like human corpses that have been underwater for some time; bloated and discolored flesh dripping with foul water, empty eye-sockets, tongue frequently protruding from between blackened lips. Their visage and the stench of decay surrounding them are so disgusting that anyone seeing a drowned one or coming within 20 feet of one must roll a saving throw vs. poison. A failed saving throw indicates that the character is nauseated, suffering a -1 penalty to his attack roll and a +1 penalty to his AC for 2d4 rounds. On land, drowned ones move slowly, with a clumsy, shambling gait. In water, however, they can swim with frightening speed.</p><p>Drowned ones have an abiding hatred for the living and attack them at any opportunity. These attacks often show surprising cunning (for example, luring ships onto the rocks and attacking the sailors as they try to save themselves from the wreck). Drowned ones take advantage of their swimming speed by attacking ships as they lie at anchor - climbing aboard the vessel and trying to drive the sailors overboard, where they can deal with them more easily.</p><p>Drowned ones attack with the weapons typical of sailors: short swords, daggers, hooks, clubs, belaying pins, etc. Because of the unnatural strength of the creatures, these weapons all inflict 1d10 points of damage. The putrid water that drips from the drowned ones contains many bacteria, so any successful hit has a 10% chance of causing a severe disease in the victim. The water-logged condition of the creature's flesh means that fire and fire-based magic cause only half damage. Lightning, electrical, and cold-based attacks inflict double damage. Drowned ones are immune to <i>sleep</i>, <i>charm</i> spells, illusions, and other mind-altering spells. Because they are created by the direct will of a deity, they cannot be turned.</p><p>Many of the humans who become drowned ones were priests while alive, and they retain their powers as undead. There is a 50% chance that each drowned one encountered is a priest of level 1d4. These creatures are granted their spells directly from Nerull (or similar deity), receiving only baneful spells.</p><p>Drowned ones congregate in loose packs. Their only motivation is their hatred for the living. They have no need to eat, although they rend and chew the flesh of their prey (this is probably just to strike terror in others). Underwater, drowned ones are active around the clock and are often found in the sunken wrecks of the ships in which they drowned. They are active above the surface during the night. Drowned ones normally stray no more than 100 yards from the water. If the wind drives the fog onto the coast, however, they can roam inland as far as the fog reaches. When the fog retreats, or when the sun is about to rise, they must return to the water.</p>\n","images":["<img src=\"grf/xx.gif\" width=\"150\" height=\"75\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Advanced Dungeons & Dragons 2nd Edition\" title=\"Advanced Dungeons & Dragons 2nd Edition\" align=\"right\">","<img src=\"img/zombie.gif\" alt=\"Zombie\" title=\"Zombie\" border=\"0\" width=\"300\" height=\"360\" style=\"text-align:right;\" align=\"right\">","<img src=\"grf/tsr_sm.png\" width=\"56\" height=\"59\" border=\"0\" alt=\"TSR\">"],"setting":"Advanced Dungeons & Dragons 2nd Edition","statblock":{"Common":{"Activity Cycle":"Night","Alignment":"Neutral","Armor Class":"8","Climate/Terrain":"Any","Damage/Attack":"1-8","Diet":"None","Frequency":"Rare","Hit Dice":"2","Intelligence":"Non- (0)","Magic Resistance":"See below","Morale":"Special","Movement":"6","No. Appearing":"3-24","No. of Attacks":"1","Organization":"None","Size":"M (6')","Special Attacks":"Nil","Special Defenses":"Spell immunity","THAC0":"19","Treasure":"Nil","XP Value":"65"},"Ju-ju":{"Activity Cycle":"Night","Alignment":"Neutral evil","Armor Class":"6","Climate/Terrain":"Any","Damage/Attack":"3-12","Diet":"None","Frequency":"Very rare","Hit Dice":"3+12","Intelligence":"Low (5-7)","Magic Resistance":"See below","Morale":"Special","Movement":"9","No. Appearing":"1-4","No. of Attacks":"1","Organization":"None","Size":"M (6')","Special Attacks":"See below","Special Defenses":"Spell immunity","THAC0":"15","Treasure":"Nil","XP Value":"975"},"Lord":{"Activity Cycle":"Night","Alignment":"Neutral evil","Armor Class":"6","Climate/Terrain":"Any","Damage/Attack":"2-8/2-8","Diet":"Carrion","Frequency":"Very rare","Hit Dice":"6","Intelligence":"Average (8-10)","Magic Resistance":"Nil","Morale":"Average (8-10)","Movement":"6","No. Appearing":"1","No. of Attacks":"2","Organization":"Solitary","Size":"M (6')","Special Attacks":"See below","Special Defenses":"Spell immunity","THAC0":"15","Treasure":"A","XP Value":"650"},"Monster":{"Activity Cycle":"Night","Alignment":"Neutral","Armor Class":"6","Climate/Terrain":"Any","Damage/Attack":"4-16","Diet":"None","Frequency":"Very rare","Hit Dice":"6","Intelligence":"Non- (0)","Magic Resistance":"See below","Morale":"Special","Movement":"9","No. Appearing":"1-6","No. of Attacks":"1","Organization":"None","Size":"L (8-12')","Special Attacks":"Nil","Special Defenses":"Spell immunity","THAC0":"15","Treasure":"Nil","XP Value":"650"},"Sea":{"Activity Cycle":"Night","Alignment":"Chaotic evil","Armor Class":"7","Climate/Terrain":"Shallow water","Damage/Attack":"1-10","Diet":"Scavenger","Frequency":"Rare","Hit Dice":"5","Intelligence":"Low (5-7)","Magic Resistance":"Nil","Morale":"Fearless (19-20)","Movement":"6, Sw 12","No. Appearing":"2-24","No. of Attacks":"1","Organization":"Pack","Size":"M (6')","Special Attacks":"Stench, disease, spell use","Special Defenses":"Spell immunity","THAC0":"15","Treasure":"M","XP Value":"420"}},"title":"Zombie"},"sources":["2102","2140"],"statblock_names":[],"title":"Zombie","prev_key":"zombdese","next_key":"zombligh","monster_path":"/appendix/zombie"}},"staticQueryHashes":[],"slicesMap":{}}
