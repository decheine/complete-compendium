They have magical (nonpsionic) telepathy (applicable only to all other brown unicorns within range) and ESP (which reaches all other beings, one person per round) out to a 60' radius; both powers operate continuously. They can cast a special <i>sleep </i> spell three times per day; this spell is exactly like the wizard spell but it affects at least one creature regardless of level. The spell works normally against creatures of 4+4 HD or less, but creatures of higher levels are allowed a saving throw vs. spells to avoid being put to sleep. Brown unicorns are never surprised, thanks to their mental talents, unless they are attacked at long range by missile fire.</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Habitat/Society:</b> Brown unicorns (&ldquo;roanicorns&rdquo;, as some call them) have a herd mentality. Each herd has one stallion and several mares. Stallions mark out their territories by placing a &ldquo;mental barrier&rdquo; along the borders of their territories. This beacon alerts other brown unicorns or psionically sensitive creatures that have crossed into the brown unicorn's demesnes, but does not hinder them. Brown unicorns sometimes bury themselves in sand on especially hot desert days. They can be ridden by maidens of any human or demihuman race who are pure of heart.</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Ecology:</b> These gentle creatures are herbivores that live on desert flowers, cacti, and sparse desert grasses. They can go for up to four days without food or water.</p><p>A brown unicorn's horn can be used to manufacture a special <i>sleeping potion</i>. Any character who drinks this potion is placed into suspended animation that is permanent until dispelled. A successful saving throw vs. poison negates this effect.</p><br clear=\"all\" style=\"clear:both; height:0;\">\r\n","images":["<img src=\"grf/dr.gif\" width=\"150\" height=\"75\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Dragon Magazine\" title=\"Dragon Magazine\" align=\"right\">","<img src=\"grf/add2_01.gif\" width=\"200\" height=\"56\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Advanced Dungeons & Dragons 2nd Edition\">"],"setting":"Dragon Magazine","statblock":{"Unicorn, Brown":{"Activity Cycle":"Day","Alignment":"Neutral","Armor Class":"3","Climate/Terrain":"Tropical Desert","Damage/Attack":"1-4/1-4/1-8","Diet":"Herbivore","Frequency":"Rare","Hit Dice":"3+4","Intelligence":"Very (11-12)","Magic Resistance":"Nil","Morale":"Elite (13-14)","Movement":"18","No. Appearing":"1-10","No. of Attacks":"3","Organization":"Herd","Size":"L","Special Attacks":"See below","Special Defenses":"See below","THAC0":"17","Treasure":"Nil","XP Value":"650"}},"title":"Unicorn, Brown"},"sources":["Dragon#190"],"statblock_names":[],"title":"Unicorn, Brown","prev_key":"unicblac","next_key":"uniccunn"}},"staticQueryHashes":[],"slicesMap":{}}
