While the powers listed above are the most common, some aarakocra have different or additional powers.</p><p class=\"f\">A race of intelligent, birdlike creatures living in the deepest deserts of Athas, the rare Athasian <a href=\"/appendix/aarakocr\">aarakocra</a> spends its time soaring on thermals in search of food.</p><p>The aarakocra is 7 to 8 feet tall with a wingspan of 20 feet or more. Because of its large wingspan, an aarakocra can carry as much as 75% of its own body weight and still fly easily. An aarakocra can fly a short distance carrying a burden equaling 125% of its own body weight. The average body weight of a full grown male is 100 pounds and a female is 85 pounds.</p><p>Each wing has a &ldquo;hand&rdquo; at its midpoint, consisting of three fingers and an opposable thumb. The fourth finger forms the rigid leading edge of the wing. In flight the hands cannot be used, but on the ground the aarakocra can use its hands almost as a human would. The aarakocra's body is protected by a thin bony plate on the chest, much like a solid rib cage. Talons on its legs can be used as claws and can be retracted to reveal a second set of hands, also with three fingers and an opposable thumb. Except for the chest plate, the entire skeleton is hollow and extremely fragile.</p><p>From a distance, the Athasian aarakocra resembles a huge <a href=\"/appendix/bird\">vulture</a>. Its black eyes, set in the front of the head, provide excellent vision over a long range. The plumage is generally black with a white collar for adult males and black or brown with a smaller white collar for females. Adolescents are a mixture of brown and black. The beak is large and covers most of the head. Plumage begins at the crown of the head and is darker near the head, except for the collar. Athasian aarakocra speak their own language and the languages of vultures and other large birds. Some speak the common tongue (5% to 10% chance depending on how deep in the wastelands a tribe lives).</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Combat:</b> Aarakocra can fight in the air or on the ground. They prefer aerial combat since their bones are too fragile to withstand a solid blow from a human-sized opponent. In combat against creatures on the ground, they prefer to fly over their victim and drop weighted nets. Some aarakocra use darts to harass ground-based opponents.</p><p>If their opponents can fly, the aarakocra generally forgo the use of the net, although large groups sometimes use nets on flying creatures. Normally, aarakocra attack flying creatures with long spears, diving from above and allowing the momentum to carry the spear through the target. Such an attack doubles the damage if the aarakocra have been able to dive at least 50 feet. Only the very largest aarakocra can carry more than one of these spears, they can attack with both at once with no penalty, causing double damage on each strike. All diving attacks are made at +4 and should be treated as a charge attack. All other penalties and restrictions of charge attacks apply.</p><p>The effect of the aarakocra's nets depends on if the opponent is flying at the time it becomes entangled. Creatures on the ground that are hit by a net are entangled and unable to participate in any combat until they make a successful Strength check to get free of the net. Flying creatures hit by a net can no longer fly and immediately begin falling. If they cannot escape the net or use some magical means to arrest the fall, normal falling damage applies.</p><p>Unless victims are entangled in nets, aarakocra are cautious in ground combat. If the aarakocra outnumber their opponents they advance in a straight line and thrust with their spears. If outnumbered, or the opponents are particularly tough, the aarakocra withdraw. Victims entangled in nets are killed or incapacitated for use as food or ransom.</p><p>Athasian aarakocra are mindful of their physical limitations as well as their comparatively low psionic abilities. They do not normally initiate psionic combat. At the first sign of psionic powers from any of their victims, however, all aarakocra that have some ability will use whatever attack and defense modes they can in an attempt to destroy the threat. Large groups of is or more aarakocra may initiate psionic combat if their leaders feel they can win quickly and avoid physical combat.</p><p>In desperation, an aarakocra can attempt to bite an opponent in combat. Because of the unwieldiness of its beak, the aarakocra has a THAC0 of 18 if attacking with this appendage. Further, the birdman causes only 1d2 points of damage with the beak.</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Habitat/Society:</b> Athasian aarakocra live in tribes with 6-20 (2d8+4) members, depending on the prestige of the leader. The largest tribe ever recorded had 50 members. The tribal hunting territory depends on the size of the tribe, usually about 500 square miles for a tribe of 10 members. There are no rigid boundaries between tribes and border disputes are not uncommon.</p><p>Alignments of tribe members are similar to the alignment of the leader. A tribe that has a leader who is neutral good may have neutral good, chaotic good, lawful good, and true neutral members. A predominantly evil tribe does not recognize boundaries with other tribes and treats other tribes as inferior beings to be eliminated.</p><p>Athasian aarakocra aren't happy in enclosed spaces, but they they take refuge in a cave or building if necessary.</p><p>Nonevil tribes live in rocky aeries in the highest peaks they can find. Evil tribes are normally nomadic and use an aerie made by another tribe if they need to remain in an area for a long time, even if they have to evict the tribe that made the nest.</p><p>Aarakocra aren't friendly toward intruders in their territory, especially caravans. They try to extract a toll from the caravan for passage through the desert. Good-aligned tribes allow unhindered passage of caravans that pay a tribute. If someone refuses to pay the tribute, the aarakocra try to capture scouts or outriders from the party and hold them until an even larger tribute is paid. The payment may be either livestock or shiny objects. Aarakocra are smart enough not to be taken in by glass baubles instead of gems, although they cannot tell the difference between the more common gems and the rare ones.</p><p>Evil tribes ask for tribute and often attack a caravan whether it pays or not. Aarakocra always demand shiny objects such as stones. These tribes find humans and demihumans to be quite tasty and prefer them to other food.</p><p>Good-aligned tribes of aarakocra sometimes return a lost traveler to the edge of the desert after first removing any valuables the traveler may be carrying. On very rare occasions a tribe might return a lost group of travelers to the more frequently traveled parts of the desert, again after first taking any valuables as payment.</p><p>The oldest male is the leader of the tribal hunting party and has 4+4 Hit Dice. The oldest female is in charge of the tribal aerie and has 3+3 HD. In tribes that have more than 15 members, the next oldest aarakocra serves as shaman and has 3+3 HD; the shaman completes the triumvirate necessary for proper worship and the summoning of elementals. (Interestingly, no magic-using aarakocra has ever been recorded.) Tribes without a shaman cannot summon <a href=\"/appendix/element1\">air elementals</a>, which is an important part of aarakocra culture.</p><p>The shaman is the leader of the daily sun worship. Aarakocra worship the sun because it provides them with the thermals they need to soar in search of food. The shaman also leads the mystic rituals used to summon an air elemental. Summoning an air elemental is usually done only in preparation for the tribe's most sacred ceremony, the hunt. Small tribes must band together for this ceremony to allow the triumvirate to be formed.</p><p>The ceremony to summon an air elemental must be conducted at dawn and requires the oldest male and female to emit a highpitched keening whistle. The shaman conducts an intricate dance around them, simultaneously chanting an ancient summoning mantra.</p><p>The hunt is the final part of the initiation of adolescent aarakocra to adulthood and often takes the tribe far from their normal teritory. The target is always a <a href=\"/appendix/drakalsi\">silt drake</a>. The hunt is the only time the females leave the relative safety of the nest. Even an evil tribe will not interfere with a tribe on a hunt. An air elemental is often summoned to help find the drake, but never takes part in the actual combat. Although the adult members of the tribe take part in the initial phases of the combat, it is the initiates who deliver the final, killing blows to me drake. Scars from the hunt are considered a mark of pride among all aarakocra.</p><p>The females spend about eight months of the year incubating their eggs. Athasian aarakocra mate for life and a pair normally produces as many as 10 offspring. A female lays one egg a year. Constant incubation is not required because of the high daytime temperatures, so the females can maintain the nest and keep the tribe's treasure in order.</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Ecology:</b> Athasian aarakocra are high on the food chain and have no natural enemies other than <a href=\"/appendix/drakatha\">drakes</a>. Unless evil, aarakocra leave their own territory only to hunt the silt drake and return as soon as possible when the hunt is over. (Evil aarakocra attack others, as noted above.) Aarakocra eggs and hatchlings are sought after by wealthy land owners who wish to use the creatures as scouts and sentries. An egg can bring as much as 10 cp in Tyr's marketplace. Tribes that have had eggs or hatchlings stolen have long memories and sometimes take revenge against the thief at a later date. Captive aarakocra join any tribe they come in contact with.</p><p>Athasian aarakocra have a natural life span of 21-30 years.</p><p></p><br clear=\"all\" style=\"clear:both; height:0;\">\r\n","images":["<img src=\"grf/ds.gif\" width=\"150\" height=\"75\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Dark Sun\" title=\"Dark Sun\" align=\"right\">","<img src=\"img/aarakath.gif\" alt=\"Aarakocra (Athas)\" title=\"Aarakocra (Athas)\" border=\"0\" width=\"300\" height=\"360\" style=\"text-align:right;\" align=\"right\">","<img src=\"grf/add2_01.gif\" width=\"200\" height=\"56\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Advanced Dungeons & Dragons 2nd Edition\">"],"setting":"Dark Sun","statblock":{"Aarakocra (Athas)":{"Activity Cycle":"Day","Alignment":"Any","Armor Class":"7","Climate/Terrain":"Deep desert","Damage/Attack":"1d3/1d3 or by weapon","Diet":"Carnivore","Frequency":"Rare","Hit Dice":"2+2","Intelligence":"Average (8-10)","Magic Resistance":"Nil","Morale":"Steady (11)","Movement":"6, Fl 36 (C)","No. Appearing":"1d10","No. of Attacks":"2","Organization":"Tribal","Size":"M (20'+ wingspan)","Special Attacks":"Nil","Special Defenses":"Nil","THAC0":"17","Treasure":"Varies","XP Value":"65"}},"title":"Aarakocra (Athas)"},"sources":["2433"],"statblock_names":[],"title":"Aarakocra (Athas)","prev_key":"zygraat","next_key":"aarakocr","monster_path":"/appendix/aarakath"}}},"pageContext":{"monster_key":"shadpers","monster_data":{"TSR":["2105"],"fullBody":"  <table cellspacing=\"0\" cellpadding=\"0\"><tr class=\"bk\"><th> </th><th class=\"cn\">Shadowperson</th><th class=\"cn\">Revered Ancient One</th></tr><tr><th>Climate/Terrain:</th><td>Any/Subterranean</td><td>Any/Subterranean</td></tr><tr><th>Frequency:</th><td>Rare</td><td>Very rare</td></tr><tr><th>Organization:</th><td>Clan</td><td>Solitary</td></tr><tr><th>Activity Cycle:</th><td>Night</td><td>Any</td></tr><tr><th>Diet:</th><td>Omnivore</td><td>None</td></tr><tr><th>Intelligence:</th><td>Very (11-12)</td><td>Genius (18)</td></tr><tr><th>Treasure:</th><td>Nil</td><td>Nil</td></tr><tr><th>Alignment:</th><td>Neutral (good)</td><td>Neutral good</td></tr><tr><th>No. Appearing:</th><td>2-40</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><th>Armor Class:</th><td>2</td><td>Nil</td></tr><tr><th>Movement:</th><td>12, Fl 18 (C)</td><td>Nil</td></tr><tr><th>Hit Dice:</th><td>3+1</td><td>Nil</td></tr><tr><th>THAC0:</th><td>17</td><td>Nil</td></tr><tr><th>No. of Attacks:</th><td>1</td><td>Nil</td></tr><tr><th>Damage/Attack:</th><td>1-8 (shadowstaff)</td><td>Nil</td></tr><tr><th>Special Attacks:</th><td>See below</td><td>Nil</td></tr><tr><th>Special Defenses:</th><td>See below</td><td>Nil</td></tr><tr><th>Magic Resistance:</th><td>Nil</td><td>Nil</td></tr><tr><th>Size:</th><td>M (5' tall)</td><td>Nil</td></tr><tr><th>Morale:</th><td>Steady (11)</td><td>Nil</td></tr><tr><th>XP Value:</th><td>175</td><td>Nil</td></tr></table><p class=\"f\">The shadowpeople are a race of mammals that lives underground in small self-contained communities. One of the oldest races of Krynn, they are little known to the outside world.</p><p>Shadowpeople resemble slim, gangly apes. They have hairy heads with small flat noses, pointed ears, and sharp fangs, two of which protrude above their lower lips when their mouths are closed. Their eyes are green or amber and resemble those of a cat. They have long claws on their hands and feet. Smooth fur, either black or dark brown, covers their bodies. A long, stretchable membrane connects their arms to their flanks. The membrane enables them to glide through the air, covering ten feet of ground for every foot they drop (for instance, a shadowperson dropping from a ten-foot ledge could glide 100').</p><p>When in their subterranean homes, shadowpeople wear few clothes. Their fur provides sufficient warmth, and they have no interest in body decoration. On their rare trips to the surface, they are likely to wear long, dark robes and hoods to conceal their identities.</p><p>To the surface-dwelling races of Krynn, shadowpeople are commonly regarded as creatures of myth. Cherishing their privacy, the shadowpeople have gone to great lengths to preserve their reputation as nonexistent creatures, seldom interacting with other races and maintaining their communities far from other civilized outposts. Shadowpeople are, in tact, a kind and benevolent race, capable in drastic situations of uniting with good citizens of other races to promote their common interests.</p><p>Shadowpeople can communicate in a series of squeaks and growls that forms a primitive language, but they are much more likely to use their advanced mental abilities to send and receive messages. All shadowpeople can send and receive thoughts telepathically to creatures within a 60-foot range, assuming the sender and receiver share a common language and that they are not separated by more than three feet of stone, three inches of iron, or any solid sheeting of lead, gold, or steel. Additionally, shadowpeople can use <i>ESP</i> at will, as per the 2nd-level wizard spell, up to a range of 50 yards.</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Combat:</b> The two classes of shadowpeople are warriors and counselors. The counselors are unskilled in combat; they depend on the warriors for protection. Shadow warriors are skilled and able fighters, striking quickly and silently. Each shadow warrior employs a wickedly curved hook called a <i>shadowstaff</i> to both attack and restrain opponents. Once an opponent has been impaled on the hook of a shadowstaff, the opponent's attacks are hampered and he continues to take damage from the hook. The victim suffers a -2 penalty on all attack rolls and sustains an additional 1d8 points of damage every round until one or the other of the combatants is dead or until the fight ends. An impaled victim is also unable to cast spells. The construction of a shadowstaff is such that is very difficult for a victim to pull himself free once he is impaled; if he takes no other actions and succeeds in Dexterity checks for two successive rounds with a -2 penalty, he has freed himself from the shadowstatf.</p><p>The <i>ESP</i> ability of the shadowpeople accounts for their low Armor Class. In combat, they are able to anticipate the actions of their enemies and can take the appropriate measures to defend themselves. Shadowpeople cannot be surprised by any sentient creature within 60'.</p><p>The shadowpeople's most important defense is the <i>mindweave</i>, a ritual undertaken by shadow warriors prior to venturing into situations of potential danger. The mindweave ritual lasts about one hour, during which time the participants link hands to form a large circle, then chant in unison and concentrate. During the mindweave, the shadowpeople use their telepathic abilities to tie all of their minds together. For 1d4+4 hours after the ritual, the shadowpeople share a collective awareness that enables them to move, fight, and defend in perfect unison, giving them a +1 bonus to all attack rolls and saving throws. Characters of other races invited to participate in the mindweave can also receive the benefits of the ritual if they succeed in an Intelligence check with a -5 penalty.</p><p>Though good fighters in darkness, shadowpeople are severely handicapped when fighting in the light of the sun. When the sky is overcast, they can execute normal actions, but do so at great pain, causing a -2 penalty to all attack rolls. In bright sunlight, this penalty increases to -4. Shadowpeople exposed to bright sunlight become temporarily blinded after 2d6 turns of exposure. The blindness lasts for a number of hours equal to the number of turns spent outside.</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Habitat/Society:</b> Shadowpeople are most commonly found in catacombs beneath large cities, or in dungeons and underground reaches of vast, abandoned cities in the more desolate regions of the world. One of the largest communities of shadowpeople is located beneath the dark city of Sanction, a port in central Ansalon on the northeastern shore of the New Sea. Surrounded by three great volcanos, Sanction is an unappealing jumble of warehouses, brothels, slum dwellings, and slave markets. During the War of the Lance, Sanction was a major stronghold of the forces of evil; unknown to them, a tunnel system honeycombing the land below the city provided a hiding place for a thriving community of shadowpeople.</p><p>In Sanction, as in other populated areas near shadowpeople communities, the existence of the race is the subject of rumors and speculation. From time to time, a solitary explorer or an inquisitive wizard may stumble on a community of shadowpeople, but such intruders are usually sworn to secrecy or given potions to erase their memories. So far, no one has revealed the existence of the shadowpeople to the world at large - at least, no such stories have yet been believed. Still, shadowpeople are occasionally seen at night by children or the elderly; shadowpeople have a special affinity for human children and senior citizens, and sometimes engage in pleasant mental conversations with them at their bedsides.</p><p>Shadowpeople have a close, clannish culture. Mated shadowpeople have 1d4 offspring at a time, and the young are cared for by whatever adults happen to be nearby. When young shadowpeople reach the age of ten, they are assigned to either the warrior class or to the counselor class. These assignments are not arbitrary; they are made on the basis of the youngsters' aptitudes and interests.</p><p>The warriors patrol the underground tunnel network and defend the clan against intrusion. The counselors make all of the administrative decisions for the clan. One of the counselors is elected to serve as king. The king makes the final decisions in instances where the counselors are unable to reach a consensus. The counselors also participate in a mindweave ritual similar to that of the warriors to create the Revered Ancient One (see following).</p><p>A typical settlement of shadowpeople is a labyrinth of subterranean passages linking variouslysized natural caverns. Passages leading to the main living areas are lined with traps. Intruders stepping in the wrong place trigger two immense slabs of stone to drop from the ceiling, completely blocking the passage. Trapped intruders are telepathically examined by shadow warriors to determine their motives. Intruders are required to agree to the terms of the shadow warriors, or are left trapped between the slabs.</p><p>Personal residences are furnished simply, with stone furniture and woven mats for sleeping. Each residence has three vents; one vent leads to the surface to bring in fresh air, the second leads to an underground stream to provide fresh water, and the third leads to a bottomless passage or a lava stream for refuse disposal. Other caverns are used for mushroom farms, conference rooms, and recreational areas. The deepest and most inaccessible cavern is reserved for the Revered Ancient One.</p><p>Shadowpeople do not collect treasure, but are fascinated by art. Most cavern walls are decorated with elaborate drawings depicting scenes and heroes from the shadowpeople's past. Shadow warriors sometimes venture to the surface world to make oft with an especially attractive sculpture or painting.</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Ecology:</b> Shadowpeople have no natural enemies, save for the <a href=\"/appendix/lizmankr\">jarak-sinn</a>, a race of savage lizard men who occasionally raid shadowpeople settlements in an attempt to drive them from their homes. Shadowpeople do not keep any domesticated animals.</p><p>Mushrooms and other fungi are dietary staples, supplemented at times by insects and worms. Shadowpeople do not engage in trade.</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Revered Ancient One</b></p>  <p class=\"ni\">The Revered Ancient One is the manifestation of the mental energies of the shadowpeople counselors. When the counselors link hands to form a large circle, then chant in unison and concentrate for an hour, the Revered Ancient One appears. The amount of time the Revered Ancient One remains conjured depends on the number of counselors performing the mindweave ritual. If four to ten counselors perform the ritual, the Revered Ancient One appears for 1-2 hours. If 11 or more counselors perform the ritual, the Revered Ancient One appears for 2d4 hours. Fewer than four counselors cannot conjure the Revered Ancient One. Characters of other races can participate in the mindweave ritual, but they do not count as counselors when determining whether the Revered Ancient One is conjured or how long it stays.</p><p>The Revered Ancient One has no physical properties or attributes. Its intelligence is always genius level, and it is always of neutral good alignment. The Revered Ancient One can cast <i>cure serious wounds</i> an unlimited number of times per day, providing the recipient of the spell is brought to the Revered Ancient One's cavern (see below). The Revered Ancient One can also cast <i>teleport without error</i> on anyone brought to its cavern; the recipient can be teleported to any location in the Prime Material plane, providing he has been there before. Finally, the Revered Ancient One can answer any question mentally posed by any of the counselors who conjured it The Revered Ancient One answers these questions with 95% accuracy: however, the Revered Ancient One has no ability to foresee future events.</p><p>The Revered Ancient One usually resides in a sacred cavern adjacent to the shadowpeople's community. This cavern is always blocked by a permanent <i>wall of force</i> that the Revered Ancient One can negate at will, enabling it to decide who will pass through. No light of any kind exists in the Revered Ancient Ones cavern, even when it is not present: the darkness cannot be dispelled by magical or any other means. The Revered Ancient One communicates mentally, a character perceives its words as a soothing voice, distant and echoed.</p><p></p><br clear=\"all\" style=\"clear:both; height:0;\">\r\n","images":["<img src=\"grf/gh.gif\" width=\"150\" height=\"75\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Greyhawk\" title=\"Greyhawk\" align=\"right\">","<img src=\"img/shadpers.gif\" alt=\"Shadowperson\" title=\"Shadowperson\" border=\"0\" width=\"300\" height=\"360\" style=\"text-align:right;\" align=\"right\">","<img src=\"grf/add2_01.gif\" width=\"200\" height=\"56\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Advanced Dungeons & Dragons 2nd Edition\">"],"setting":"Greyhawk","statblock":{"Revered Ancient One":{"Activity Cycle":"Any","Alignment":"Neutral good","Armor Class":"Nil","Climate/Terrain":"Any/Subterranean","Damage/Attack":"Nil","Diet":"None","Frequency":"Very rare","Hit Dice":"Nil","Intelligence":"Genius (18)","Magic Resistance":"Nil","Morale":"Nil","Movement":"Nil","No. Appearing":"1","No. of Attacks":"Nil","Organization":"Solitary","Size":"Nil","Special Attacks":"Nil","Special Defenses":"Nil","THAC0":"Nil","Treasure":"Nil","XP Value":"Nil"},"Shadowperson":{"Activity Cycle":"Night","Alignment":"Neutral (good)","Armor Class":"2","Climate/Terrain":"Any/Subterranean","Damage/Attack":"1-8 (shadowstaff)","Diet":"Omnivore","Frequency":"Rare","Hit Dice":"3+1","Intelligence":"Very (11-12)","Magic Resistance":"Nil","Morale":"Steady (11)","Movement":"12, Fl 18 (C)","No. Appearing":"2-40","No. of Attacks":"1","Organization":"Clan","Size":"M (5' tall)","Special Attacks":"See below","Special Defenses":"See below","THAC0":"17","Treasure":"Nil","XP Value":"175"}},"title":"Shadowperson"},"sources":["2105"],"statblock_names":[],"title":"Shadowperson","prev_key":"shadow","next_key":"shadslow","monster_path":"/appendix/shadpers"}},"staticQueryHashes":[],"slicesMap":{}}
