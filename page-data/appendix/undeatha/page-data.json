While the powers listed above are the most common, some aarakocra have different or additional powers.</p><p class=\"f\">A race of intelligent, birdlike creatures living in the deepest deserts of Athas, the rare Athasian <a href=\"/appendix/aarakocr\">aarakocra</a> spends its time soaring on thermals in search of food.</p><p>The aarakocra is 7 to 8 feet tall with a wingspan of 20 feet or more. Because of its large wingspan, an aarakocra can carry as much as 75% of its own body weight and still fly easily. An aarakocra can fly a short distance carrying a burden equaling 125% of its own body weight. The average body weight of a full grown male is 100 pounds and a female is 85 pounds.</p><p>Each wing has a &ldquo;hand&rdquo; at its midpoint, consisting of three fingers and an opposable thumb. The fourth finger forms the rigid leading edge of the wing. In flight the hands cannot be used, but on the ground the aarakocra can use its hands almost as a human would. The aarakocra's body is protected by a thin bony plate on the chest, much like a solid rib cage. Talons on its legs can be used as claws and can be retracted to reveal a second set of hands, also with three fingers and an opposable thumb. Except for the chest plate, the entire skeleton is hollow and extremely fragile.</p><p>From a distance, the Athasian aarakocra resembles a huge <a href=\"/appendix/bird\">vulture</a>. Its black eyes, set in the front of the head, provide excellent vision over a long range. The plumage is generally black with a white collar for adult males and black or brown with a smaller white collar for females. Adolescents are a mixture of brown and black. The beak is large and covers most of the head. Plumage begins at the crown of the head and is darker near the head, except for the collar. Athasian aarakocra speak their own language and the languages of vultures and other large birds. Some speak the common tongue (5% to 10% chance depending on how deep in the wastelands a tribe lives).</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Combat:</b> Aarakocra can fight in the air or on the ground. They prefer aerial combat since their bones are too fragile to withstand a solid blow from a human-sized opponent. In combat against creatures on the ground, they prefer to fly over their victim and drop weighted nets. Some aarakocra use darts to harass ground-based opponents.</p><p>If their opponents can fly, the aarakocra generally forgo the use of the net, although large groups sometimes use nets on flying creatures. Normally, aarakocra attack flying creatures with long spears, diving from above and allowing the momentum to carry the spear through the target. Such an attack doubles the damage if the aarakocra have been able to dive at least 50 feet. Only the very largest aarakocra can carry more than one of these spears, they can attack with both at once with no penalty, causing double damage on each strike. All diving attacks are made at +4 and should be treated as a charge attack. All other penalties and restrictions of charge attacks apply.</p><p>The effect of the aarakocra's nets depends on if the opponent is flying at the time it becomes entangled. Creatures on the ground that are hit by a net are entangled and unable to participate in any combat until they make a successful Strength check to get free of the net. Flying creatures hit by a net can no longer fly and immediately begin falling. If they cannot escape the net or use some magical means to arrest the fall, normal falling damage applies.</p><p>Unless victims are entangled in nets, aarakocra are cautious in ground combat. If the aarakocra outnumber their opponents they advance in a straight line and thrust with their spears. If outnumbered, or the opponents are particularly tough, the aarakocra withdraw. Victims entangled in nets are killed or incapacitated for use as food or ransom.</p><p>Athasian aarakocra are mindful of their physical limitations as well as their comparatively low psionic abilities. They do not normally initiate psionic combat. At the first sign of psionic powers from any of their victims, however, all aarakocra that have some ability will use whatever attack and defense modes they can in an attempt to destroy the threat. Large groups of is or more aarakocra may initiate psionic combat if their leaders feel they can win quickly and avoid physical combat.</p><p>In desperation, an aarakocra can attempt to bite an opponent in combat. Because of the unwieldiness of its beak, the aarakocra has a THAC0 of 18 if attacking with this appendage. Further, the birdman causes only 1d2 points of damage with the beak.</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Habitat/Society:</b> Athasian aarakocra live in tribes with 6-20 (2d8+4) members, depending on the prestige of the leader. The largest tribe ever recorded had 50 members. The tribal hunting territory depends on the size of the tribe, usually about 500 square miles for a tribe of 10 members. There are no rigid boundaries between tribes and border disputes are not uncommon.</p><p>Alignments of tribe members are similar to the alignment of the leader. A tribe that has a leader who is neutral good may have neutral good, chaotic good, lawful good, and true neutral members. A predominantly evil tribe does not recognize boundaries with other tribes and treats other tribes as inferior beings to be eliminated.</p><p>Athasian aarakocra aren't happy in enclosed spaces, but they they take refuge in a cave or building if necessary.</p><p>Nonevil tribes live in rocky aeries in the highest peaks they can find. Evil tribes are normally nomadic and use an aerie made by another tribe if they need to remain in an area for a long time, even if they have to evict the tribe that made the nest.</p><p>Aarakocra aren't friendly toward intruders in their territory, especially caravans. They try to extract a toll from the caravan for passage through the desert. Good-aligned tribes allow unhindered passage of caravans that pay a tribute. If someone refuses to pay the tribute, the aarakocra try to capture scouts or outriders from the party and hold them until an even larger tribute is paid. The payment may be either livestock or shiny objects. Aarakocra are smart enough not to be taken in by glass baubles instead of gems, although they cannot tell the difference between the more common gems and the rare ones.</p><p>Evil tribes ask for tribute and often attack a caravan whether it pays or not. Aarakocra always demand shiny objects such as stones. These tribes find humans and demihumans to be quite tasty and prefer them to other food.</p><p>Good-aligned tribes of aarakocra sometimes return a lost traveler to the edge of the desert after first removing any valuables the traveler may be carrying. On very rare occasions a tribe might return a lost group of travelers to the more frequently traveled parts of the desert, again after first taking any valuables as payment.</p><p>The oldest male is the leader of the tribal hunting party and has 4+4 Hit Dice. The oldest female is in charge of the tribal aerie and has 3+3 HD. In tribes that have more than 15 members, the next oldest aarakocra serves as shaman and has 3+3 HD; the shaman completes the triumvirate necessary for proper worship and the summoning of elementals. (Interestingly, no magic-using aarakocra has ever been recorded.) Tribes without a shaman cannot summon <a href=\"/appendix/element1\">air elementals</a>, which is an important part of aarakocra culture.</p><p>The shaman is the leader of the daily sun worship. Aarakocra worship the sun because it provides them with the thermals they need to soar in search of food. The shaman also leads the mystic rituals used to summon an air elemental. Summoning an air elemental is usually done only in preparation for the tribe's most sacred ceremony, the hunt. Small tribes must band together for this ceremony to allow the triumvirate to be formed.</p><p>The ceremony to summon an air elemental must be conducted at dawn and requires the oldest male and female to emit a highpitched keening whistle. The shaman conducts an intricate dance around them, simultaneously chanting an ancient summoning mantra.</p><p>The hunt is the final part of the initiation of adolescent aarakocra to adulthood and often takes the tribe far from their normal teritory. The target is always a <a href=\"/appendix/drakalsi\">silt drake</a>. The hunt is the only time the females leave the relative safety of the nest. Even an evil tribe will not interfere with a tribe on a hunt. An air elemental is often summoned to help find the drake, but never takes part in the actual combat. Although the adult members of the tribe take part in the initial phases of the combat, it is the initiates who deliver the final, killing blows to me drake. Scars from the hunt are considered a mark of pride among all aarakocra.</p><p>The females spend about eight months of the year incubating their eggs. Athasian aarakocra mate for life and a pair normally produces as many as 10 offspring. A female lays one egg a year. Constant incubation is not required because of the high daytime temperatures, so the females can maintain the nest and keep the tribe's treasure in order.</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Ecology:</b> Athasian aarakocra are high on the food chain and have no natural enemies other than <a href=\"/appendix/drakatha\">drakes</a>. Unless evil, aarakocra leave their own territory only to hunt the silt drake and return as soon as possible when the hunt is over. (Evil aarakocra attack others, as noted above.) Aarakocra eggs and hatchlings are sought after by wealthy land owners who wish to use the creatures as scouts and sentries. An egg can bring as much as 10 cp in Tyr's marketplace. Tribes that have had eggs or hatchlings stolen have long memories and sometimes take revenge against the thief at a later date. Captive aarakocra join any tribe they come in contact with.</p><p>Athasian aarakocra have a natural life span of 21-30 years.</p><br clear=\"all\" style=\"clear:both; height:0;\">\r\n","images":["<img src=\"grf/ds.gif\" width=\"150\" height=\"75\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Dark Sun\" title=\"Dark Sun\" align=\"right\">","<img src=\"img/aarakath.gif\" alt=\"Aarakocra (Athas)\" title=\"Aarakocra (Athas)\" border=\"0\" width=\"300\" height=\"360\" style=\"text-align:right;\" align=\"right\">","<img src=\"grf/add2_01.gif\" width=\"200\" height=\"56\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Advanced Dungeons & Dragons 2nd Edition\">"],"setting":"Dark Sun","statblock":{"Aarakocra (Athas)":{"Activity Cycle":"Day","Alignment":"Any","Armor Class":"7","Climate/Terrain":"Deep desert","Damage/Attack":"1d3/1d3 or by weapon","Diet":"Carnivore","Frequency":"Rare","Hit Dice":"2+2","Intelligence":"Average (8-10)","Magic Resistance":"Nil","Morale":"Steady (11)","Movement":"6, Fl 36 (C)","No. Appearing":"1d10","No. of Attacks":"2","Organization":"Tribal","Size":"M (20'+ wingspan)","Special Attacks":"Nil","Special Defenses":"Nil","THAC0":"17","Treasure":"Varies","XP Value":"65"}},"title":"Aarakocra (Athas)"},"sources":["2433"],"statblock_names":[],"title":"Aarakocra (Athas)","prev_key":"zygraat","next_key":"aarakocr","monster_path":"/appendix/aarakath"}}},"pageContext":{"monster_key":"undeatha","monster_data":{"TSR":["2433"],"fullBody":"  <p class=\"f\">The undead of Athas are classified as either freewilled undead or controlled undead. Freewilled undead once belonged to an intelligent species and in undeath continue to think for themselves. They are often referred to simply as undead. Controlled undead are animated corpses such as <a href=\"/appendix/skeleton\">skeletons</a> and <a href=\"/appendix/zombie\">zombies</a> that may not belong to an intelligent species. In undeath they are controlled by others, usually evil wizards or priests. They are often referred to as the walking dead. Freewilled undead are far more dangerous than controlled undead as they can think and act independently.</p><p>All undead are intolerant of all intelligent living races and most attack them on sight. Even undead who were of good alignment in life are evil in undeath and do not tolerate the presence of living beings for long. Many undead actually seek out and attack living beings whom they sense nearby.</p><p>Undead seldom need food or water and are immune to the harshest elements. They are often unaffected by normal weapons and can resist massive amounts of damage without being slowed down.</p><p>The undead of Athas are all unique creatures. While undead are classified by their basic powers and weaknesses, most have additional powers and weaknesses beyond those commonly associated with creatures of their type. Undead retain all the powers, skills, and abilities they possessed in life based upon their character class and level.</p><p>The type of undead a creature becomes upon death is based upon the motivation or event that caused the undead to resist death. While certain races are more likely to become certain types of undead, this is because members of that particular race often share similar motivations.</p><p>The different categories of undead on Athas are the <a href=\"/appendix/dhaot\">dhaot</a>, <a href=\"/appendix/fael\">fael</a>, <a href=\"/appendix/kaisharg\">kaisharga</a>, <a href=\"/appendix/meorty\">meorty</a>, <a href=\"/appendix/raaig\">raaig</a>, <a href=\"/appendix/rackspir\">racked spirit</a>, skeleton, zombie, <a href=\"/appendix/zombthin\">thinking zombie</a>, <a href=\"/appendix/tliz\">t'liz</a>, and <a href=\"/appendix/wraiatha\">wraith</a>.</p><p><i>Dhaot:</i> Dhaots are incorporeal undead who cannot rest until they return home. Even after returning home as spirits, they often find they cannot rest until their physical remains are also returned to their home. The desert is filled with dhaots of <a href=\"/appendix/halfatha\">halflings</a> who died outside their beloved forests.</p><p><i>Fael:</i> Faels are gluttonous undead who appear wherever a large amount of food is present. They try to remain inconspicuous, but their insatiable hunger eventually gives them away as they eat every scrap of food in sight. Faels are never full as their hunger is derived from their insatiable hunger for excesses they had in life. Most faels are from the upper echelons of society and most are <a href=\"/appendix/elfathas\">elves</a> or humans.</p><p><i>Kaisharga:</i> Often called the Dead Lords, the kaisharga are undead similar to <a href=\"/appendix/lich\">liches</a>. They voluntarily sought undeath, believing it to be a form of immortality. They are incredibly powerful and extremely rare. The largest known collection of them is found in the Valley of Dust and Fire.</p><p><i>Meorty:</i> Meorties are undead who were once protectors of domain that vanished more than 2,000 years ago. They were placed in crypts with large amounts of treasure, so they might continue to look after their realms in death. They emerge from their crypts and hunt down those who violate their ancient laws. Each ancient domain has its own ancient laws and its own meorties; however, the boundaries of the ancient domains have been forgotten and even the ancient laws are lost except for those held over as customs by the people of the various regions. Those who see a meorty's crypt seldom live to tell of the experience. All meorties are of the old races (human, elf, <a href=\"/appendix/dwaratha\">dwarf</a>, <a href=\"/appendix/giantath\">giant</a>, and halfling).</p><p><i>Raaig:</i> Raaigs are incorporeal spirits sustained by their unwavering belief and sense of duty to ancient gods that no longer exist on Athas. Raaigs serve as guardians to ancient shrines and temples, protecting them from those who follow different moral precepts, primarily those of different alignment than themselves. They occasionally appear to those they deem worthy who are of the same alignment. All raaigs are at least 2,000 years old and all are of the old races (human, elf, dwarf, giant, and halfling).</p><p><i>Racked spirit:</i> Racked spirits are incorporeal undead animated by their own guilt over committing some act that violated their basic nature. These guilty spirits suffer eternally and only gain joy and peace through acts of destruction. The dwarven banshee, created when a dwarf forsakes his life purpose, is the most common.</p><p><i>Skeleton and zombie:</i> Skeletons and zombies are controlled undead. They retain none of the special powers, skills, or abilities they possessed in life. They are simply animated corpses controlled by an evil wizard or priest. Most skeletons and zombies are man-sized or smaller, but larger corpses such as mekillot skeletons and zombie giants are often animated by more powerful necromancers.</p><p><i>Thinking zombie:</i> Thinking zombies are freewilled zombies often identifiable by the spark of hate burning within then eyes. Creatures who die before completing an important task (often under the compulsion of a geas or quest spell) often become thinking zombies. They continue in their effort to complete their quest and are often very clever in their approaches. They never allow themselves to be diverted from their goal. Many thinking zombies are giants and <a href=\"/appendix/gianhalf\">half-giants</a>, as they are often selected for quests because of their size and strength.</p><p><i>T'liz:</i> T'lizes are powerful defilers who died before completing their magical studies. They continue in their studies as undead and are among the most powerful and dangerous of the undead. Most defilers are hunted down and destroyed by the sorcerer kings and the Veiled Alliance before becoming t'lizes. They are valuable sources of information since they live for centuries, but they are evil and cunning and only associate with and aid the living when it is to their own advantage.</p><p><i>Wraith:</i> Athasian wraiths differ from other wraiths in that they voluntarily embraced undeath as a form of existence. They are incorporeal spirits, and servants of the <a href=\"/appendix/dragotyr\">Dragon</a>. They are occasionally found among the ancient ruins guarding the bodies and possessions of their dead relatives.</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Special Undead Powers</b></p><p class=\"ni\"><i>Accelerate Aging:</i> The undead have the power to cause a living victim to age 5-30 (1d6&times;5) years with their touch. The victim receives a save vs. spells, gaining +1 to their save for each HD they have greater than that of the undead.</p><p><i>Cause Despair:</i> The undead have the power to cause living victims within a 30-foot or greater (30 feet + 10 feet per HD more than 5) radius to lose hope and become depressed. Victims must successfully save vs. spells or suffer a -1 to -4 penalty (1d4) on all rolls for a number of turns equal to twice the undead's HD.</p><p><i>Cause Fear:</i> The undead have the power to cause fear in any living creature within 10 feet. Treat the effects as those caused by a <a href=\"/appendix/dragon\">dragon's</a> fear aura. Those with fewer than 1 HD flee for 4-24 (4d6) turns. Those with fewer HD than the undead must successfully save vs. petrification or suffer a -2 penalty on attack rolls against the undead.</p><p><i>Cause Paralysis:</i> The undead's touch causes paralysis for 2-8 (2d4) rounds (1%-50%), 2-8 (2d4) turns (51%-75%), 2-8 (2d4) hours (76%-90%), or 2-8 (2d4) days (91%-100%). Victims must successfully save vs. paralysis to avoid the effects.</p><p><i>Cause Revulsion:</i> The undead can cause all within a certain (30 feet + 10 feet per HD more than 5) radius to become physically ill, suffering extreme nausea. Victims must successfully save vs. spells or suffer a -1 to -4 (1d4) penalty on all rolls for a number of turns equal to twice the undead's HD.</p><p>Claws: The undead has claws, either retractable or not, that cause 1-6 (1d6) points of damage. If the undead already have claws, then the claws are longer and sharper, causing an additional +2 damage.</p><p><i>Control Undead:</i> The undead have the power to control undead as an evil cleric equal in level to their HD. If they were clerics during life, their power to control undead is increased by 1-8 (1d8) levels.</p><p><i>Drain Attributes:</i> The undead can drain 1.4 (d4) points from one of a victim's attributes with its touch. The victim must make a successful save vs. death so no attributes are lost, but if the save is failed, the attribute points are lost. The effects last a number of days equal to twice the undead's HD. After that, the points are regained at a rate of 3 per day. If a victim's attribute is reduced to zero, the victim falls unconscious until at least one attribute point returns.</p><p><i>Drain PSPs:</i> The undead can drain 3-24 (3d8) PSPs from their victims if they have psionics. The victim must make a successful save vs. paralyzation to resist the effect.</p><p><i>Enhanced Senses:</i> While all undead typically possess infravision, those with this power have one or more specially acute senses. Their senses allow them to spot the living much easier and they are more difficult to surprise (-1 to their surprise roll).</p><p><i>Fangs:</i> The undead have fangs that serve as an additional attack, causing 1-4 (1d4) points of damage. If the undead already have fangs, the damage they cause is increased by +2 as the fangs are longer and sharper than usual.</p><p><i>Improved Saves:</i> The undead gain +1 on all saving throws.</p><p><i>Increased Attribute:</i> The undead have a score of 19-24 in one attribute of the DM's choosing.</p><p><i>Increased Hit Points:</i> The undead have an additional 1-4 (1d4) hit points per HD.</p><p><i>Increased Movement Rate:</i> The undead's movement rate is 3 more than other undead of its kind.</p><p><i>Increased Psionic Strength:</i> This power is useful only to undead who have psionic powers. Undead with psionic powers receive an additional 3 PSPs per HD.</p><p><i>Increased Weapon Resistance:</i> The undead can be hit only by a creature with greater HD than themselves or by a +1 or greater magical weapon. If the undead already have a +1 THAC0 bonus, then increase the defense to +2, meaning they can only be hit by a creature at least 2 HD greater than themselves or with a +2 or greater magical weapon. If the undead already have a +2 THAC0 bonus, then increase the defenses to +3, meaning they can only be hit by a creature at least 3 HD greater than themselves or with a +3 or greater magical weapon.</p><p><i>Magic Resistance:</i> The undead have an additional 5% magic resistance per HD up to 90%.</p><p><i>Produce Undead:</i> The undead can produce one lesser controlled undead (animated skeletons or zombies) for each HD they have. This may be used once per day and there must be skeletons or corpses present.</p><p><i>Psionic Wild Talents:</i> The undead have one or two psionic wild talents per 3 HD, along with any prerequisite psionic powers they might require. The DM can choose the wild talents or select them randomly by using Table 12 in <i>The Complete psionicists Handbook</i>. The undead have a number of PSPs to use for each of their powers plus an additional 4 PSPs per HD more than 1.</p><p><i>Regeneration:</i> The undead can regenerate 1 hit point per round. If they can already regenerate 1 hit point per round, then their regeneration increases to 2 hit points per round.</p><p><i>Spell Immunity:</i> The undead are immune to 1-4 (1d4) spells of the DM's choosing.</p><p><i>Spell-like Power:</i> The undead can cast any selected spells totaling a certain number of levels based on then Hit Dice levels. The number and level of the innate spells possessed by the undead is based upon their HD. Spell levels gained, based on undead's Hit Dice: 1-3 HD gains 1-3 spell levels, 4-6 HD gains 1-4 spell levels, 7-9 HD gains 1-6 spell levels, 10-12 HD gains 2-8 spell levels, 13-15 HD gains 3-12 spell levels, maximum spell level of 5th level; 16+ HD gains 3-12+2 spell levels, maximum spell level of 6th level.</p><p>The spells can be cast at will, there is no limit to the number of times these spells may be cast, and no spell components are required. Treat the spell as though it were cast by a wizard or priest of a level equal to the undead's Hit Dice.
