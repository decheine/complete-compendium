While the powers listed above are the most common, some aarakocra have different or additional powers.</p><p class=\"f\">A race of intelligent, birdlike creatures living in the deepest deserts of Athas, the rare Athasian <a href=\"/appendix/aarakocr\">aarakocra</a> spends its time soaring on thermals in search of food.</p><p>The aarakocra is 7 to 8 feet tall with a wingspan of 20 feet or more. Because of its large wingspan, an aarakocra can carry as much as 75% of its own body weight and still fly easily. An aarakocra can fly a short distance carrying a burden equaling 125% of its own body weight. The average body weight of a full grown male is 100 pounds and a female is 85 pounds.</p><p>Each wing has a &ldquo;hand&rdquo; at its midpoint, consisting of three fingers and an opposable thumb. The fourth finger forms the rigid leading edge of the wing. In flight the hands cannot be used, but on the ground the aarakocra can use its hands almost as a human would. The aarakocra's body is protected by a thin bony plate on the chest, much like a solid rib cage. Talons on its legs can be used as claws and can be retracted to reveal a second set of hands, also with three fingers and an opposable thumb. Except for the chest plate, the entire skeleton is hollow and extremely fragile.</p><p>From a distance, the Athasian aarakocra resembles a huge <a href=\"/appendix/bird\">vulture</a>. Its black eyes, set in the front of the head, provide excellent vision over a long range. The plumage is generally black with a white collar for adult males and black or brown with a smaller white collar for females. Adolescents are a mixture of brown and black. The beak is large and covers most of the head. Plumage begins at the crown of the head and is darker near the head, except for the collar. Athasian aarakocra speak their own language and the languages of vultures and other large birds. Some speak the common tongue (5% to 10% chance depending on how deep in the wastelands a tribe lives).</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Combat:</b> Aarakocra can fight in the air or on the ground. They prefer aerial combat since their bones are too fragile to withstand a solid blow from a human-sized opponent. In combat against creatures on the ground, they prefer to fly over their victim and drop weighted nets. Some aarakocra use darts to harass ground-based opponents.</p><p>If their opponents can fly, the aarakocra generally forgo the use of the net, although large groups sometimes use nets on flying creatures. Normally, aarakocra attack flying creatures with long spears, diving from above and allowing the momentum to carry the spear through the target. Such an attack doubles the damage if the aarakocra have been able to dive at least 50 feet. Only the very largest aarakocra can carry more than one of these spears, they can attack with both at once with no penalty, causing double damage on each strike. All diving attacks are made at +4 and should be treated as a charge attack. All other penalties and restrictions of charge attacks apply.</p><p>The effect of the aarakocra's nets depends on if the opponent is flying at the time it becomes entangled. Creatures on the ground that are hit by a net are entangled and unable to participate in any combat until they make a successful Strength check to get free of the net. Flying creatures hit by a net can no longer fly and immediately begin falling. If they cannot escape the net or use some magical means to arrest the fall, normal falling damage applies.</p><p>Unless victims are entangled in nets, aarakocra are cautious in ground combat. If the aarakocra outnumber their opponents they advance in a straight line and thrust with their spears. If outnumbered, or the opponents are particularly tough, the aarakocra withdraw. Victims entangled in nets are killed or incapacitated for use as food or ransom.</p><p>Athasian aarakocra are mindful of their physical limitations as well as their comparatively low psionic abilities. They do not normally initiate psionic combat. At the first sign of psionic powers from any of their victims, however, all aarakocra that have some ability will use whatever attack and defense modes they can in an attempt to destroy the threat. Large groups of is or more aarakocra may initiate psionic combat if their leaders feel they can win quickly and avoid physical combat.</p><p>In desperation, an aarakocra can attempt to bite an opponent in combat. Because of the unwieldiness of its beak, the aarakocra has a THAC0 of 18 if attacking with this appendage. Further, the birdman causes only 1d2 points of damage with the beak.</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Habitat/Society:</b> Athasian aarakocra live in tribes with 6-20 (2d8+4) members, depending on the prestige of the leader. The largest tribe ever recorded had 50 members. The tribal hunting territory depends on the size of the tribe, usually about 500 square miles for a tribe of 10 members. There are no rigid boundaries between tribes and border disputes are not uncommon.</p><p>Alignments of tribe members are similar to the alignment of the leader. A tribe that has a leader who is neutral good may have neutral good, chaotic good, lawful good, and true neutral members. A predominantly evil tribe does not recognize boundaries with other tribes and treats other tribes as inferior beings to be eliminated.</p><p>Athasian aarakocra aren't happy in enclosed spaces, but they they take refuge in a cave or building if necessary.</p><p>Nonevil tribes live in rocky aeries in the highest peaks they can find. Evil tribes are normally nomadic and use an aerie made by another tribe if they need to remain in an area for a long time, even if they have to evict the tribe that made the nest.</p><p>Aarakocra aren't friendly toward intruders in their territory, especially caravans. They try to extract a toll from the caravan for passage through the desert. Good-aligned tribes allow unhindered passage of caravans that pay a tribute. If someone refuses to pay the tribute, the aarakocra try to capture scouts or outriders from the party and hold them until an even larger tribute is paid. The payment may be either livestock or shiny objects. Aarakocra are smart enough not to be taken in by glass baubles instead of gems, although they cannot tell the difference between the more common gems and the rare ones.</p><p>Evil tribes ask for tribute and often attack a caravan whether it pays or not. Aarakocra always demand shiny objects such as stones. These tribes find humans and demihumans to be quite tasty and prefer them to other food.</p><p>Good-aligned tribes of aarakocra sometimes return a lost traveler to the edge of the desert after first removing any valuables the traveler may be carrying. On very rare occasions a tribe might return a lost group of travelers to the more frequently traveled parts of the desert, again after first taking any valuables as payment.</p><p>The oldest male is the leader of the tribal hunting party and has 4+4 Hit Dice. The oldest female is in charge of the tribal aerie and has 3+3 HD. In tribes that have more than 15 members, the next oldest aarakocra serves as shaman and has 3+3 HD; the shaman completes the triumvirate necessary for proper worship and the summoning of elementals. (Interestingly, no magic-using aarakocra has ever been recorded.) Tribes without a shaman cannot summon <a href=\"/appendix/element1\">air elementals</a>, which is an important part of aarakocra culture.</p><p>The shaman is the leader of the daily sun worship. Aarakocra worship the sun because it provides them with the thermals they need to soar in search of food. The shaman also leads the mystic rituals used to summon an air elemental. Summoning an air elemental is usually done only in preparation for the tribe's most sacred ceremony, the hunt. Small tribes must band together for this ceremony to allow the triumvirate to be formed.</p><p>The ceremony to summon an air elemental must be conducted at dawn and requires the oldest male and female to emit a highpitched keening whistle. The shaman conducts an intricate dance around them, simultaneously chanting an ancient summoning mantra.</p><p>The hunt is the final part of the initiation of adolescent aarakocra to adulthood and often takes the tribe far from their normal teritory. The target is always a <a href=\"/appendix/drakalsi\">silt drake</a>. The hunt is the only time the females leave the relative safety of the nest. Even an evil tribe will not interfere with a tribe on a hunt. An air elemental is often summoned to help find the drake, but never takes part in the actual combat. Although the adult members of the tribe take part in the initial phases of the combat, it is the initiates who deliver the final, killing blows to me drake. Scars from the hunt are considered a mark of pride among all aarakocra.</p><p>The females spend about eight months of the year incubating their eggs. Athasian aarakocra mate for life and a pair normally produces as many as 10 offspring. A female lays one egg a year. Constant incubation is not required because of the high daytime temperatures, so the females can maintain the nest and keep the tribe's treasure in order.</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Ecology:</b> Athasian aarakocra are high on the food chain and have no natural enemies other than <a href=\"/appendix/drakatha\">drakes</a>. Unless evil, aarakocra leave their own territory only to hunt the silt drake and return as soon as possible when the hunt is over. (Evil aarakocra attack others, as noted above.) Aarakocra eggs and hatchlings are sought after by wealthy land owners who wish to use the creatures as scouts and sentries. An egg can bring as much as 10 cp in Tyr's marketplace. Tribes that have had eggs or hatchlings stolen have long memories and sometimes take revenge against the thief at a later date. Captive aarakocra join any tribe they come in contact with.</p><p>Athasian aarakocra have a natural life span of 21-30 years.</p><p></p><br clear=\"all\" style=\"clear:both; height:0;\">\r\n","images":["<img src=\"grf/ds.gif\" width=\"150\" height=\"75\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Dark Sun\" title=\"Dark Sun\" align=\"right\">","<img src=\"img/aarakath.gif\" alt=\"Aarakocra (Athas)\" title=\"Aarakocra (Athas)\" border=\"0\" width=\"300\" height=\"360\" style=\"text-align:right;\" align=\"right\">","<img src=\"grf/add2_01.gif\" width=\"200\" height=\"56\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Advanced Dungeons & Dragons 2nd Edition\">"],"setting":"Dark Sun","statblock":{"Aarakocra (Athas)":{"Activity Cycle":"Day","Alignment":"Any","Armor Class":"7","Climate/Terrain":"Deep desert","Damage/Attack":"1d3/1d3 or by weapon","Diet":"Carnivore","Frequency":"Rare","Hit Dice":"2+2","Intelligence":"Average (8-10)","Magic Resistance":"Nil","Morale":"Steady (11)","Movement":"6, Fl 36 (C)","No. Appearing":"1d10","No. of Attacks":"2","Organization":"Tribal","Size":"M (20'+ wingspan)","Special Attacks":"Nil","Special Defenses":"Nil","THAC0":"17","Treasure":"Varies","XP Value":"65"}},"title":"Aarakocra (Athas)"},"sources":["2433"],"statblock_names":[],"title":"Aarakocra (Athas)","prev_key":"zygraat","next_key":"aarakocr","monster_path":"/appendix/aarakath"}}},"pageContext":{"monster_key":"penangga","monster_data":{"TSR":["2132"],"fullBody":"  <table cellspacing=\"0\" cellpadding=\"0\"><tr><th>Climate/Terrain:</th><td>Any</td></tr><tr><th>Frequency:</th><td>Rare</td></tr><tr><th>Organization:</th><td>Solitary</td></tr><tr><th>Activity Cycle:</th><td>Night</td></tr><tr><th>Diet:</th><td>Blood</td></tr><tr><th>Intelligence:</th><td>Average (8-10)</td></tr><tr><th>Treasure:</th><td>Nil</td></tr><tr><th>Alignment:</th><td>Lawful evil</td></tr><tr><th>No. Appearing:</th><td>1</td></tr><tr><th>Armor Class:</th><td>10; 8 with head detached</td></tr><tr><th>Movement:</th><td>12; head detached Fl 18 (B)</td></tr><tr><th>Hit Dice:</th><td>Body variable; head 4</td></tr><tr><th>THAC0:</th><td>16</td></tr><tr><th>No. of Attacks:</th><td>1 or 2</td></tr><tr><th>Damage/Attack:</th><td>1-6 or by weapon type/1-4</td></tr><tr><th>Special Attacks:</th><td>Blood drain</td></tr><tr><th>Special Defenses:</th><td>See below</td></tr><tr><th>Magic Resistance:</th><td>See below</td></tr><tr><th>Size:</th><td>M (5-6')</td></tr><tr><th>Morale:</th><td>Steady (11)</td></tr><tr><th>XP Value:</th><td>1,400</td></tr></table><p class=\"f\">A female <a href=\"/appendix/vampire\">vampire</a> variant of great power and horrifying appearance, the penanggalan appears during daylight as an attractive human female of any character class. This &ldquo;person&rdquo; will resemble the penanggalan before its death.</p><p>At night, the penanggalan assumes its true form. Its head detaches itself from its body, rising vertically and flying off in search of human prey, to feast upon blood. Attached to the base of the head is a 3' long, slimy black &ldquo;tail&rdquo; which tapers to a point at one end. A penanggalan's eyes glow red in near-total and total darkness conditions.</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Combat:</b> In human form, the creature will fight and act in the manner appropriate to her apparent class and level, with most abilities undiminished. Thus, if she was a wizard in life, she can cast spells; if a thief, she can pick pockets. If, however, the penanggalan was a paladin before death, she is considered a normal fighter of appropriate level. If the penanggalan was a cleric, she is limited to using only those spells which have a harmful effect, and she cannot turn undead. In this human form, the body of the penanggalan is also vulnerable to damage as she was before death, and her hit points remain the same as in life. The head, however, will withstand an extra 4 HD of damage.</p><p>A <i>know alignment</i> spell cast on the creature in human form will reveal the alignment the penanggalan pursued while alive; as undead, at night, the creature is lawful evil.</p><p>In her human form, the penanggalan is immune to holy/unholy symbols and undead turning. She also has, in either form, the normal immunity of undead creatures to spells which attempt to control the mind or body.</p><p>Before night falls, a penanggalan must return to one of her secret lairs. She may have as many as six such lairs, all within an area of 25 square miles. At her lair, a penanggalan's head separates from its body and flies off in search of blood. The head always has its full hit points when it detaches, regardless of damage to the body.</p><p>Anyone who witnesses this detaching of the head must make a saving throw vs. death magic or fall irretrievably unconscious for 24 hours, and then remain <i>feebleminded</i> for 3 days. If the victim makes the save, he/she is <i>feebleminded</i> until dawn.</p><p>The head and tail will fly in search of a victim. If a penanggalan cannot find a female to kill, a male victim will do as a last resort. If there is more than one eligible female to attack, the penanggalan always attacks the one with the highest Charisma. When a suitable victim is found, the penanggalan will attempt to <i>hypnotize</i> her prey, as per the 1st-level wizard spell. The victim must make a saving throw vs. spell with a -3 penalty, or fall under the control of the penangalan for as long as it takes to feed. If a victim saves against the penanggalan's hypnotism, the monster will not be able to exert any further influence over him/her and will flee in fear and confusion to one of her lairs for the rest of the night. Furthermore, the person who made the save will be immune to any further attacks by that specific penanggalan and will be able to recognize that particular one again, regardless of the form the monster takes.</p><p>The creature makes two small lacerations on the victim's throat and feasts on the blood throughout the night. For each night's feeding, the victim loses 1-6 hit points of damage and one point each of Strength and Constitution. If the victim's Strength or Constitution is reduced to zero, the victim dies.</p><p>The penanggalan will select the same victim each night, if possible, and will continue to visit and feed on successive nights until the victim is dead. The victim must still be successfully <i>hypnotized</i> each night of the penanggalan's visitation. However, the victim's saving throw is progressively more difficult; the penalty is -4 on the second occasion, -5 on the third, and so on. A break in the sequence of one or more nights will halt the progression; the saving throw penalty will start again at -3 if the penanggalan makes renewed contact alter a night's respite.</p><p>If the victim survives the night, he/she will remember none of these events, save for some disturbingly ominous dreams, generally of dark shadowy crypts, flowing red waters, and shrivelled corpses stacked like wood. If for some reason the victim avoids further attacks, even in the event of a belatedly successful save vs. <i>hypnosis</i>, he/she will still continue to lose hit points at the rate of one per night, until the victim is dead. <i>Dispel evil</i> cast upon the victim will end this loss.</p><p>Note that hit points drained by the penanggalan cannot be restored by magical means such as curative spells, even by powerful spells such as <i>restoration</i>, unless <i>dispel evil</i> has been cast upon the victim. In effect, the victim's maximum hit points are being drained, Similarly, the victim's lost Strength and Constitution points cannot be recovered until after the <i>dispel evil</i> is cast. Once the spell has been cast, hit points are restored at the rate of one point per day, and the Strength and Constitution points at the rate of one point of each per week.</p><p>The victim is &ldquo;asleep&rdquo; during the visitations and will never actually see the creature, even if the saving throw vs. hypnotism is made. The penanggalan will never by choice attack a victim who is awake, but will attack any who threaten her lair.</p><p>Anyone who sees the detached head of the penanggalan when it is flying, feeding, or fighting, must save vs. spell, or be overcome with fear. In this form, however, the penanggalan can be turned by a cleric; treat the monster as a wraith for turning purposes. If the head is turned, it will flee to its nearest lair for the rest of the night, and rejoin its body near dawn. If it is dispelled by the priest, the creature is destroyed, and the body decays.</p><p>If a penanggalan kills a male victim, he does not return as undead. If an attempt is made to <i>raise</i> him, his chances of resurrection survival are halved. A female victim will rise from the grave in three days as a penanggalan, as a free-willed undead. If an attempt is made to <i>raise</i> her within that three day period, the chances of resurrection survival are halved. Should an attempt to <i>raise</i> the victim succeed, the victim will be unable to do anything other than rest for a week, after which all damage done by the penanggalan is healed. Failure means that no further attempt can be made; the process by which the victim becomes a penanggalan is then inexorable.</p><p>The penanggalan takes normal damage from all weapons. If weaponless and in human form, a penanggalan can bite for 1-6 hit points of damage, but it will try to avoid this attack form for fear of giving away its true nature. Damage done by this bite while in human form will not drain hit points or abilities, nor will it cause undeath.</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Habitat/Society:</b> As a penanggalan's head flies about, it sometimes makes a hissing noise, and at other times it makes a gurgling speech that is barely recognizable as Common. If an Intelligence check is made, the listener understands the speech, which is usually a pronouncement of doom or whispered secrets about what it is like to experience undeath. Any who understand the speech will get a -2 penalty on the saves they make when they first witness the penanggalan's flight.</p><p>If sunlight strikes the penanggalan's head when it is separated from the body, the head will be paralyzed and fall helplessly to the ground until nightfall. If the head and body are not reunited within seven hours of initial exposure to daylight, both will start to decay rapidly and the evil life-force which animates the creature will return to the Nine Hells. Therefore, a penanggalan will always attempt to reunite her head with her body before the first rays of dawn.</p><p>The headless body of the penanggalan, if discovered by the living, appears to be merely a decapitated corpse that is very well-preserved on the outside, though if any have the nerve to examine the neck, they will see that the internal organs are visible, and dried up as if mummified. The head will &ldquo;know&rdquo; when intruders have reached its body, and this is the only occasion when the penanggalan will actively seek out and attempt to destroy an enemy who is awake.</p><p>The shiny black tail protruding from the base of the head is prehensile. It can be used as a whip to snag and choke victims for 1d4 points of damage per hit, and has a Strength of 19. A penanggalan frequently attacks by biting and grappling with her tail. Treat this as a wrestling attack: if the creature gains a hold, she inflicts normal subdual damage plus 7 points each round for the tail's 19 Strength. In total darkness, the tail glows with an eerie black luminescence. This, coupled with the red glow from the penanggalan's eyes, makes for a truly horrible sight. People who see this glowing apparition must make a saving throw vs. spell. A failed roll gives the victim an additional -2 penalty when he/she finally sees the penanggalan's full features and must make a saving throw.</p><p>Penanggalans are solitary creatures who make their lairs in mines, ruins, crypts, underground dungeons, or other abandoned buildings or structures. These places are usually protected by simple traps such as pits, deadfalls, or poisoned spears.</p><p>These undead creatures are particularly fond of the blood of women in their late teens to early forties, with a Charisma of 13 or greater. It has been speculated that penanggalans focus on that group out of insane jealousy, since the penanggalan can no longer give or receive love. If when in human form, a penanggalan witnesses a couple being affectionate or talking of their romance, the creature will be in such a state of homicidal fury that she will single out the woman for an attack at the earliest possible opportunity.</p><p> Penanggalan are not good at seduction. Though they can flirt in some small way while in human form, they cannot express love, or engage in any displays of affection. This weakness is enough to repulse even male vampires. who, though they sometimes have beautiful vampiric women as their consorts, would never consider a penanggalan as a companion. Sometimes, vampires will indirectly give clues to a party of adventurers on the whereabouts of a penanggalan's lair, in the hope that they will destroy her.</p><p>When in human form, the penanggalan seeks parties of unwary travellers to befriend. The creature will attempt to join them, and may in fact prove extremely useful, since over her years of undeath, she has been able to pick up many skills and languages, as well as a store of information about the area she frequents. Naturally, the penanggalan will have plausible reasons for her impressive knowledge, and will sometimes even make deliberate errors, or feign ignorance in some areas. These measures are taken in order to deflect the suspicion of party members who may be wondering how their new companion manages to be omniscient.</p><p>A penanggalan who joins a party will never encamp with the party for the night, nor will she accompany them to the nocturnal safety of an inn. The creature will beg off, making excuses about other duties. She may even offer to keep guard while the others sleep. Many penanggalan attempt to pass themselves off as rangers, who are known for their vigilance.</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Ecology:</b> Othcr than the blood they drain from their victims, penanggalan do not eat or drink, though they often pretend to do so to hide their true nature from potential victims. The slimy tail of the penanggalan's head is useful in creating various types of p<i>otions of undead control</i>, as well as <i>amulets of turning</i>.</p><p></p><br clear=\"all\" style=\"clear:both; height:0;\">\r\n","images":["<img src=\"grf/ff.gif\" width=\"150\" height=\"75\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Fiends Folio\" title=\"Fiends Folio\" align=\"right\">","<img src=\"img/penangga.gif\" alt=\"Penanggalan\" title=\"Penanggalan\" border=\"0\" width=\"300\" height=\"360\" style=\"text-align:right;\" align=\"right\">","<img src=\"grf/add2_01.gif\" width=\"200\" height=\"56\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Advanced Dungeons & Dragons 2nd Edition\">"],"setting":"Fiends Folio","statblock":{"Penanggalan":{"Activity Cycle":"Night","Alignment":"Lawful evil","Armor Class":"10; 8 with head detached","Climate/Terrain":"Any","Damage/Attack":"1-6 or by weapon type/1-4","Diet":"Blood","Frequency":"Rare","Hit Dice":"Body variable; head 4","Intelligence":"Average (8-10)","Magic Resistance":"See below","Morale":"Steady (11)","Movement":"12; head detached Fl 18 (B)","No. Appearing":"1","No. of Attacks":"1 or 2","Organization":"Solitary","Size":"M (5-6')","Special Attacks":"Blood drain","Special Defenses":"See below","THAC0":"16","Treasure":"Nil","XP Value":"1,400"}},"title":"Penanggalan"},"sources":["2132"],"statblock_names":[],"title":"Penanggalan","prev_key":"peluda","next_key":"pennig","monster_path":"/appendix/penangga"}},"staticQueryHashes":[],"slicesMap":{}}
