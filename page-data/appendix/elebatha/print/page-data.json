While the powers listed above are the most common, some aarakocra have different or additional powers.</p><p class=\"f\">A race of intelligent, birdlike creatures living in the deepest deserts of Athas, the rare Athasian <a href=\"/appendix/aarakocr\">aarakocra</a> spends its time soaring on thermals in search of food.</p><p>The aarakocra is 7 to 8 feet tall with a wingspan of 20 feet or more. Because of its large wingspan, an aarakocra can carry as much as 75% of its own body weight and still fly easily. An aarakocra can fly a short distance carrying a burden equaling 125% of its own body weight. The average body weight of a full grown male is 100 pounds and a female is 85 pounds.</p><p>Each wing has a &ldquo;hand&rdquo; at its midpoint, consisting of three fingers and an opposable thumb. The fourth finger forms the rigid leading edge of the wing. In flight the hands cannot be used, but on the ground the aarakocra can use its hands almost as a human would. The aarakocra's body is protected by a thin bony plate on the chest, much like a solid rib cage. Talons on its legs can be used as claws and can be retracted to reveal a second set of hands, also with three fingers and an opposable thumb. Except for the chest plate, the entire skeleton is hollow and extremely fragile.</p><p>From a distance, the Athasian aarakocra resembles a huge <a href=\"/appendix/bird\">vulture</a>. Its black eyes, set in the front of the head, provide excellent vision over a long range. The plumage is generally black with a white collar for adult males and black or brown with a smaller white collar for females. Adolescents are a mixture of brown and black. The beak is large and covers most of the head. Plumage begins at the crown of the head and is darker near the head, except for the collar. Athasian aarakocra speak their own language and the languages of vultures and other large birds. Some speak the common tongue (5% to 10% chance depending on how deep in the wastelands a tribe lives).</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Combat:</b> Aarakocra can fight in the air or on the ground. They prefer aerial combat since their bones are too fragile to withstand a solid blow from a human-sized opponent. In combat against creatures on the ground, they prefer to fly over their victim and drop weighted nets. Some aarakocra use darts to harass ground-based opponents.</p><p>If their opponents can fly, the aarakocra generally forgo the use of the net, although large groups sometimes use nets on flying creatures. Normally, aarakocra attack flying creatures with long spears, diving from above and allowing the momentum to carry the spear through the target. Such an attack doubles the damage if the aarakocra have been able to dive at least 50 feet. Only the very largest aarakocra can carry more than one of these spears, they can attack with both at once with no penalty, causing double damage on each strike. All diving attacks are made at +4 and should be treated as a charge attack. All other penalties and restrictions of charge attacks apply.</p><p>The effect of the aarakocra's nets depends on if the opponent is flying at the time it becomes entangled. Creatures on the ground that are hit by a net are entangled and unable to participate in any combat until they make a successful Strength check to get free of the net. Flying creatures hit by a net can no longer fly and immediately begin falling. If they cannot escape the net or use some magical means to arrest the fall, normal falling damage applies.</p><p>Unless victims are entangled in nets, aarakocra are cautious in ground combat. If the aarakocra outnumber their opponents they advance in a straight line and thrust with their spears. If outnumbered, or the opponents are particularly tough, the aarakocra withdraw. Victims entangled in nets are killed or incapacitated for use as food or ransom.</p><p>Athasian aarakocra are mindful of their physical limitations as well as their comparatively low psionic abilities. They do not normally initiate psionic combat. At the first sign of psionic powers from any of their victims, however, all aarakocra that have some ability will use whatever attack and defense modes they can in an attempt to destroy the threat. Large groups of is or more aarakocra may initiate psionic combat if their leaders feel they can win quickly and avoid physical combat.</p><p>In desperation, an aarakocra can attempt to bite an opponent in combat. Because of the unwieldiness of its beak, the aarakocra has a THAC0 of 18 if attacking with this appendage. Further, the birdman causes only 1d2 points of damage with the beak.</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Habitat/Society:</b> Athasian aarakocra live in tribes with 6-20 (2d8+4) members, depending on the prestige of the leader. The largest tribe ever recorded had 50 members. The tribal hunting territory depends on the size of the tribe, usually about 500 square miles for a tribe of 10 members. There are no rigid boundaries between tribes and border disputes are not uncommon.</p><p>Alignments of tribe members are similar to the alignment of the leader. A tribe that has a leader who is neutral good may have neutral good, chaotic good, lawful good, and true neutral members. A predominantly evil tribe does not recognize boundaries with other tribes and treats other tribes as inferior beings to be eliminated.</p><p>Athasian aarakocra aren't happy in enclosed spaces, but they they take refuge in a cave or building if necessary.</p><p>Nonevil tribes live in rocky aeries in the highest peaks they can find. Evil tribes are normally nomadic and use an aerie made by another tribe if they need to remain in an area for a long time, even if they have to evict the tribe that made the nest.</p><p>Aarakocra aren't friendly toward intruders in their territory, especially caravans. They try to extract a toll from the caravan for passage through the desert. Good-aligned tribes allow unhindered passage of caravans that pay a tribute. If someone refuses to pay the tribute, the aarakocra try to capture scouts or outriders from the party and hold them until an even larger tribute is paid. The payment may be either livestock or shiny objects. Aarakocra are smart enough not to be taken in by glass baubles instead of gems, although they cannot tell the difference between the more common gems and the rare ones.</p><p>Evil tribes ask for tribute and often attack a caravan whether it pays or not. Aarakocra always demand shiny objects such as stones. These tribes find humans and demihumans to be quite tasty and prefer them to other food.</p><p>Good-aligned tribes of aarakocra sometimes return a lost traveler to the edge of the desert after first removing any valuables the traveler may be carrying. On very rare occasions a tribe might return a lost group of travelers to the more frequently traveled parts of the desert, again after first taking any valuables as payment.</p><p>The oldest male is the leader of the tribal hunting party and has 4+4 Hit Dice. The oldest female is in charge of the tribal aerie and has 3+3 HD. In tribes that have more than 15 members, the next oldest aarakocra serves as shaman and has 3+3 HD; the shaman completes the triumvirate necessary for proper worship and the summoning of elementals. (Interestingly, no magic-using aarakocra has ever been recorded.) Tribes without a shaman cannot summon <a href=\"/appendix/element1\">air elementals</a>, which is an important part of aarakocra culture.</p><p>The shaman is the leader of the daily sun worship. Aarakocra worship the sun because it provides them with the thermals they need to soar in search of food. The shaman also leads the mystic rituals used to summon an air elemental. Summoning an air elemental is usually done only in preparation for the tribe's most sacred ceremony, the hunt. Small tribes must band together for this ceremony to allow the triumvirate to be formed.</p><p>The ceremony to summon an air elemental must be conducted at dawn and requires the oldest male and female to emit a highpitched keening whistle. The shaman conducts an intricate dance around them, simultaneously chanting an ancient summoning mantra.</p><p>The hunt is the final part of the initiation of adolescent aarakocra to adulthood and often takes the tribe far from their normal teritory. The target is always a <a href=\"/appendix/drakalsi\">silt drake</a>. The hunt is the only time the females leave the relative safety of the nest. Even an evil tribe will not interfere with a tribe on a hunt. An air elemental is often summoned to help find the drake, but never takes part in the actual combat. Although the adult members of the tribe take part in the initial phases of the combat, it is the initiates who deliver the final, killing blows to me drake. Scars from the hunt are considered a mark of pride among all aarakocra.</p><p>The females spend about eight months of the year incubating their eggs. Athasian aarakocra mate for life and a pair normally produces as many as 10 offspring. A female lays one egg a year. Constant incubation is not required because of the high daytime temperatures, so the females can maintain the nest and keep the tribe's treasure in order.</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Ecology:</b> Athasian aarakocra are high on the food chain and have no natural enemies other than <a href=\"/appendix/drakatha\">drakes</a>. Unless evil, aarakocra leave their own territory only to hunt the silt drake and return as soon as possible when the hunt is over. (Evil aarakocra attack others, as noted above.) Aarakocra eggs and hatchlings are sought after by wealthy land owners who wish to use the creatures as scouts and sentries. An egg can bring as much as 10 cp in Tyr's marketplace. Tribes that have had eggs or hatchlings stolen have long memories and sometimes take revenge against the thief at a later date. Captive aarakocra join any tribe they come in contact with.</p><p>Athasian aarakocra have a natural life span of 21-30 years.</p><p></p><br clear=\"all\" style=\"clear:both; height:0;\">\r\n","images":["<img src=\"grf/ds.gif\" width=\"150\" height=\"75\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Dark Sun\" title=\"Dark Sun\" align=\"right\">","<img src=\"img/aarakath.gif\" alt=\"Aarakocra (Athas)\" title=\"Aarakocra (Athas)\" border=\"0\" width=\"300\" height=\"360\" style=\"text-align:right;\" align=\"right\">","<img src=\"grf/add2_01.gif\" width=\"200\" height=\"56\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Advanced Dungeons & Dragons 2nd Edition\">"],"setting":"Dark Sun","statblock":{"Aarakocra (Athas)":{"Activity Cycle":"Day","Alignment":"Any","Armor Class":"7","Climate/Terrain":"Deep desert","Damage/Attack":"1d3/1d3 or by weapon","Diet":"Carnivore","Frequency":"Rare","Hit Dice":"2+2","Intelligence":"Average (8-10)","Magic Resistance":"Nil","Morale":"Steady (11)","Movement":"6, Fl 36 (C)","No. Appearing":"1d10","No. of Attacks":"2","Organization":"Tribal","Size":"M (20'+ wingspan)","Special Attacks":"Nil","Special Defenses":"Nil","THAC0":"17","Treasure":"Varies","XP Value":"65"}},"title":"Aarakocra (Athas)"},"sources":["2433"],"statblock_names":[],"title":"Aarakocra (Athas)","prev_key":"zygraat","next_key":"aarakocr","monster_path":"/appendix/aarakath"}}},"pageContext":{"monster_key":"elebatha","monster_data":{"TSR":["2433"],"fullBody":"  <p class=\"f\">The elemental beast is a creature of low intelligence that is native to one of the four elemental planes. The physical form of the elemental beast is composed of one of the four elements - earth, air, fire, or water. The beast is composed of only the purest elemental material and there is no substance within it other than its native element.</p><p>The only proven way of transporting the elemental beast to the Prime Material Plane is by some magical means such as a rod, staff, wand, or spell. There are, however, myths of these beasts appearing near areas of intense &ldquo;elemental activity&rdquo; (an elemental beast of water would appear in the center of a whirlpool). Magical researchers have developed a theory that as the energy from a natural elemental occurrence (hurricane, tornado, whirlpool, firestorm. earthquake) reaches an extreme intensity, a temporary rift can develop between the Prime Material Plane and the elemental planes that release elemental beasts.</p><p>When summoned to the Prime Material Plane, only the &ldquo;elemental essence&rdquo; or life force of the elemental beast is brought forth. Therefore, the beast must adopt forms of its element that are available on that particular plane. The prime planes are all made from the various mixes of the four basic elements, and therefore each element is available everywhere on the prime planes. However, because the elements are all combined, the elemental beast is less &ldquo;pure&rdquo; and therefore less powerful than if it were encountered on its home plane where the base element is of the purest nature.</p><p>This impurity also causes the beast pain that varies by the degree to which its element is contaminated with other material. An elemental beast of water that is summoned near a bog or swamp would likely be in extreme agony while the same creature summoned near a spring-fed lake would experience a lesser degree of discomfort. Extreme pain causes the beast to enter a rage that, if unchecked, could cause it to turn on its summoner.</p><p>As only the elemental essence is brought to the Prime Material Plane, a beast is impervious to certain attacks. An elemental beast is immune to all physical attacks that are nonmagical. Magical attacks include such natural abilities as breath weapons, gaze attacks, poisons, paralysis, and other innate powers. No creature of less than 4 HD can harm the elemental beast without magical assistance.</p><p>The mind of the elemental beast is very different from beings of the Prime Material Plane. An attempt to control or contact these beasts psionically causes the psionisist to enter a trancelike state. During this time, the individual babbles, screams, and wails, but does not speak. This state lasts for 3-18 (3d6) rounds and then the psionicist enters a comatose state for 3-30 (3d10) hours. When he wakes he has no recollection of the events that transpired between the attempted contact and his waking.</p><p>An elemental beast is susceptible to spells and magical items that affect such creatures. <i>Protection from evil</i> spells and devices that create such effects protect the target from the creature. While the beast cannot touch or enter areas protected, it can affect the surrounding areas and cause damage using methods that require no contact. For example, an <a href=\"/appendix/elebair\">elemental beast of air</a> could create a whirlwind that surrounds the target, causing the victim to be pelted with debris and suffer the appropriate damage.</p><p>On its home plane, an elemental beast is highly sought by the <a href=\"/appendix/genie\">genie</a> races as a pet, guardian, or hunting companion. The beast truly excels as a hunting companion. Its sensitivity to impure elements makes it an excellent tracker. This tracking ability only applies on its home plane since prime worlds are far too impure and create too much white noise for the creature to use this ability effectively. This sensitivity is so keen that the beast can even track natives of the plane if they have a physical form that contains any material not of the purest element.</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Summoning an Elemental Beast:</b> Elemental beasts are summoned using a variant of most spells that are capable of contacting and summoning an <a href=\"/appendix/elementa\">elemental</a>. Devices that summon or affect elementals have the same effect on elemental beasts unless otherwise noted. For example, a <i>censer controlling air elements</i> also controls elemental beasts of air, but a <i>ring of air elemental control</i> only effects creatures other than air elementals making their home in that plane.</p><p>As with the standard elemental summoning, each individual casting a spell or using a device creates a unique signature that is answered only once per day by creatures residing in the inner planes. There are three basic methods used to summon the beasts, a spell, a staff, or a device. An individual can use multiple methods to summon elemental beasts from the same plane. For example, a summon elemental spell can only call one elemental beast of air per day, but the same individual can use a staff or a device to summon another air beast. However, the same individual with multiple devices, even if they are different types of magical items, can only summon one of a given type of elemental beast per day using these devices.</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Controlling an Elemental Beast:</b> Once the elemental beast has been brought to the Prime Material Plane, it must be controlled. With most spells and devices this is an aspect of the summoning that is incorporated into the casting. However, if something happens to the summoner to distract him, there is a 75% chance he loses control of the beast. The summoner must maintain concentration for the entire duration of the spell or until he has communicated with the creature and given it its mission.</p><p>For every round the elemental beast is on the Prime Material Plane there is a 1% cumulative chance that it breaks free of control and becomes freewilled. At this point there is a 50% chance that the freewilled beast attacks the summoner, his party, or the closest creature if the summoner is not at hand. A beast that doesn.t attack runs off to look for an environment suited to its nature. Such loss of control happens even if the creature has been sent on a mission and direct control has been removed. If an elemental beast becomes free-willed while on a mission. there is no way to regain control and it begins a rampage that ends only when it is sent back to its home plane, it is destroyed, or 24 hours has passed since entering the rage.</p><p>If the elemental beast becomes free-willed at any time other than while fulfilling its quest, the summoner can regain control by successfully casting a <i>charm monster</i> spell or a <i>speak with monster spell</i> followed immediately by a <i>charm</i> spell. Other spells that work to temporarily stop the beast from rampaging are <i>hold monster</i> and <i>imprisonment</i>. A <i>banishment</i> spell can send a free-willed creature back to its home plane.</p><p>There are precautions that can be taken when summoning a beast that ease control. The summoner can try to make the beast experience less pain in being summoned by acquiring the purest form of the correct element. Ten cubic feet of the element is required for this to have any affect on control as the beast assimilates the finest specimens to create its new body. An elemental so created has half (rounded up) the chance of becoming free-willed. Only five cubic feet of material is needed if the substance used is from the elemental plane from which the beast is summoned. In this case, the chance of breaking control is only 25%. It is possible for another individual to arrest control of an elemental beast from the summoner. A <i>dispel magic</i> spell cast at the individual who summoned the beast, if successful, breaks the bond between the two beings and transfers that control to the caster of the <i>dispel magic</i>. Rules for casting <i>dispel magic</i> are identical to those on page 148 of the <i>Player's Handbook</i> except that on a roll of 20, the elemental beast becomes free-willed.</p><p>If control of the elemental beast is transferred to a new individual, the beast obeys his commands as if he were the original summoner. If the transfer falls, the beast's hit points are increased to the maximum 8 hit points per die. A failure also augments the bond between summoner and beast and no further attempts to seize control succeed. If the summoner loses control of the elemental beast, the creature remembers the person attempting to gain control of it and attacks him even before attacking the summoner.</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Missions:</b> Elemental beasts summoned to the Prime Material Plane can be petitioned to provide one service for the summoner. Because of the low lntelligence of these creatures, they can understand only simple commands of no more than a few words. While on this mission, there is no need to control the elemental. It is single-minded in its quest and does not stop until either the service is complete, it becomes free-willed, it is destroyed, it is sent to its home plane, or the spell lapses. For a spell caster to succeed in sending the beast on the quest, he must cast a <i>charm monster</i>. The caster must also have some means of communicating with the creature, such as a <i>speak with monster</i> spell or a <i>helm of telepathy</i>. To bind the deal, the summoner must provide a gift of a gem worth at least 1,000 gp. If the caster achieves all of this criteria, he then rolls a 1d20 for a Charisma check. A successful roll indicates that a deal has been struck and the beast provides one service. If the attempt fails, there is a 25% chance the elemental beast breaks control to become free-willed. Only one mission can be attempted per summoning.</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Returning to the Elemental Planes:</b> <b>Returning to the Elemental Planes:</b> Elemental beasts have no innate ability to return to their home planes. They look to the summoner to return them home. The ease of control and increased safety of the summoning might be explained by the creature's inability to return home and a fear of being stranded on a strange and hostile world.</p><p>Following a mission or when the original purpose of the summoning has been completed, elemental beasts return to the controller to be dismissed. If the controller is unable or unwillmg to return the beast home, the beast immediately attacks the individual. All such attacks are made as if the beast were in a berserk fury and are made at +l, but the AC has a -1 penalty.</p><p>Stranded beasts seek out a less hostile region until some means of return presents itself. This might be the source of many of the &ldquo;mythical&rdquo; elemental beasts that have been seen inhabiting the Prime Material Plane.</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Free-willed Ravenloft Elementals:</b> <b>Elemental Beasts on Athas:</b> Athasian priests often prefer to summon elemental beasts to their elemental counterparts. In this case, the beasts are slightly more controllable and can even be sent on a mission with little or no supervision. Also, the effect the elemental beasts have on any psionicist attempting to communicate with the creatures allows greater control.</p><p>Some elemental beasts stranded on Athas are quite disadvantaged compared with most prime planes. The harsh climate and terrain make both <a href=\"/appendix/elebwate\">water elemental beasts</a> and <a href=\"/appendix/elebair\">air elemental beasts</a> uneasy. There are few places on Athas where the water beasts can survive for long and the frequent sand and dust storms cause air elementals extreme pain and fury.</p><p>If an Athasian is an elemental priest or a wizard and has the ability to communicate with an elemental and the ability to return it to its home plane, the beast can frequently make a deal. As with all communication with an elemental beast, the concepts must be simple and clear or the beast becomes confused and possibly attacks the Athasian (25% chance).</p><p>While all elemental beasts are rare on Athas, <a href=\"/appendix/elebfire\">fire elemental beasts</a> have been known to exist in areas of volcanic activity. Some <a href=\"/appendix/elebeart\">earth elemental beasts</a> have been reported in the rocky badlands and the mountains.</p><p></p><br clear=\"all\" style=\"clear:both; height:0;\">\r\n","images":["<img src=\"grf/ds.gif\" width=\"150\" height=\"75\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Dark Sun\" title=\"Dark Sun\" align=\"right\">","<img src=\"img/elebatha.gif\" alt=\"Elemental Beast (Athas), General Information\" title=\"Elemental Beast (Athas), General Information\" border=\"0\" width=\"300\" height=\"360\" style=\"text-align:right;\" align=\"right\">","<img src=\"grf/add2_01.gif\" width=\"200\" height=\"56\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Advanced Dungeons & Dragons 2nd Edition\">"],"setting":"Dark Sun","title":"Elemental Beast (Athas), General Information"},"sources":["2433"],"statblock_names":[],"title":"Elemental Beast (Athas), General Information","prev_key":"elebair","next_key":"elebeart","monster_path":"/appendix/elebatha"}},"staticQueryHashes":[],"slicesMap":{}}
