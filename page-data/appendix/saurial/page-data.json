While the powers listed above are the most common, some aarakocra have different or additional powers.</p><p class=\"f\">A race of intelligent, birdlike creatures living in the deepest deserts of Athas, the rare Athasian <a href=\"/appendix/aarakocr\">aarakocra</a> spends its time soaring on thermals in search of food.</p><p>The aarakocra is 7 to 8 feet tall with a wingspan of 20 feet or more. Because of its large wingspan, an aarakocra can carry as much as 75% of its own body weight and still fly easily. An aarakocra can fly a short distance carrying a burden equaling 125% of its own body weight. The average body weight of a full grown male is 100 pounds and a female is 85 pounds.</p><p>Each wing has a &ldquo;hand&rdquo; at its midpoint, consisting of three fingers and an opposable thumb. The fourth finger forms the rigid leading edge of the wing. In flight the hands cannot be used, but on the ground the aarakocra can use its hands almost as a human would. The aarakocra's body is protected by a thin bony plate on the chest, much like a solid rib cage. Talons on its legs can be used as claws and can be retracted to reveal a second set of hands, also with three fingers and an opposable thumb. Except for the chest plate, the entire skeleton is hollow and extremely fragile.</p><p>From a distance, the Athasian aarakocra resembles a huge <a href=\"/appendix/bird\">vulture</a>. Its black eyes, set in the front of the head, provide excellent vision over a long range. The plumage is generally black with a white collar for adult males and black or brown with a smaller white collar for females. Adolescents are a mixture of brown and black. The beak is large and covers most of the head. Plumage begins at the crown of the head and is darker near the head, except for the collar. Athasian aarakocra speak their own language and the languages of vultures and other large birds. Some speak the common tongue (5% to 10% chance depending on how deep in the wastelands a tribe lives).</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Combat:</b> Aarakocra can fight in the air or on the ground. They prefer aerial combat since their bones are too fragile to withstand a solid blow from a human-sized opponent. In combat against creatures on the ground, they prefer to fly over their victim and drop weighted nets. Some aarakocra use darts to harass ground-based opponents.</p><p>If their opponents can fly, the aarakocra generally forgo the use of the net, although large groups sometimes use nets on flying creatures. Normally, aarakocra attack flying creatures with long spears, diving from above and allowing the momentum to carry the spear through the target. Such an attack doubles the damage if the aarakocra have been able to dive at least 50 feet. Only the very largest aarakocra can carry more than one of these spears, they can attack with both at once with no penalty, causing double damage on each strike. All diving attacks are made at +4 and should be treated as a charge attack. All other penalties and restrictions of charge attacks apply.</p><p>The effect of the aarakocra's nets depends on if the opponent is flying at the time it becomes entangled. Creatures on the ground that are hit by a net are entangled and unable to participate in any combat until they make a successful Strength check to get free of the net. Flying creatures hit by a net can no longer fly and immediately begin falling. If they cannot escape the net or use some magical means to arrest the fall, normal falling damage applies.</p><p>Unless victims are entangled in nets, aarakocra are cautious in ground combat. If the aarakocra outnumber their opponents they advance in a straight line and thrust with their spears. If outnumbered, or the opponents are particularly tough, the aarakocra withdraw. Victims entangled in nets are killed or incapacitated for use as food or ransom.</p><p>Athasian aarakocra are mindful of their physical limitations as well as their comparatively low psionic abilities. They do not normally initiate psionic combat. At the first sign of psionic powers from any of their victims, however, all aarakocra that have some ability will use whatever attack and defense modes they can in an attempt to destroy the threat. Large groups of is or more aarakocra may initiate psionic combat if their leaders feel they can win quickly and avoid physical combat.</p><p>In desperation, an aarakocra can attempt to bite an opponent in combat. Because of the unwieldiness of its beak, the aarakocra has a THAC0 of 18 if attacking with this appendage. Further, the birdman causes only 1d2 points of damage with the beak.</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Habitat/Society:</b> Athasian aarakocra live in tribes with 6-20 (2d8+4) members, depending on the prestige of the leader. The largest tribe ever recorded had 50 members. The tribal hunting territory depends on the size of the tribe, usually about 500 square miles for a tribe of 10 members. There are no rigid boundaries between tribes and border disputes are not uncommon.</p><p>Alignments of tribe members are similar to the alignment of the leader. A tribe that has a leader who is neutral good may have neutral good, chaotic good, lawful good, and true neutral members. A predominantly evil tribe does not recognize boundaries with other tribes and treats other tribes as inferior beings to be eliminated.</p><p>Athasian aarakocra aren't happy in enclosed spaces, but they they take refuge in a cave or building if necessary.</p><p>Nonevil tribes live in rocky aeries in the highest peaks they can find. Evil tribes are normally nomadic and use an aerie made by another tribe if they need to remain in an area for a long time, even if they have to evict the tribe that made the nest.</p><p>Aarakocra aren't friendly toward intruders in their territory, especially caravans. They try to extract a toll from the caravan for passage through the desert. Good-aligned tribes allow unhindered passage of caravans that pay a tribute. If someone refuses to pay the tribute, the aarakocra try to capture scouts or outriders from the party and hold them until an even larger tribute is paid. The payment may be either livestock or shiny objects. Aarakocra are smart enough not to be taken in by glass baubles instead of gems, although they cannot tell the difference between the more common gems and the rare ones.</p><p>Evil tribes ask for tribute and often attack a caravan whether it pays or not. Aarakocra always demand shiny objects such as stones. These tribes find humans and demihumans to be quite tasty and prefer them to other food.</p><p>Good-aligned tribes of aarakocra sometimes return a lost traveler to the edge of the desert after first removing any valuables the traveler may be carrying. On very rare occasions a tribe might return a lost group of travelers to the more frequently traveled parts of the desert, again after first taking any valuables as payment.</p><p>The oldest male is the leader of the tribal hunting party and has 4+4 Hit Dice. The oldest female is in charge of the tribal aerie and has 3+3 HD. In tribes that have more than 15 members, the next oldest aarakocra serves as shaman and has 3+3 HD; the shaman completes the triumvirate necessary for proper worship and the summoning of elementals. (Interestingly, no magic-using aarakocra has ever been recorded.) Tribes without a shaman cannot summon <a href=\"/appendix/element1\">air elementals</a>, which is an important part of aarakocra culture.</p><p>The shaman is the leader of the daily sun worship. Aarakocra worship the sun because it provides them with the thermals they need to soar in search of food. The shaman also leads the mystic rituals used to summon an air elemental. Summoning an air elemental is usually done only in preparation for the tribe's most sacred ceremony, the hunt. Small tribes must band together for this ceremony to allow the triumvirate to be formed.</p><p>The ceremony to summon an air elemental must be conducted at dawn and requires the oldest male and female to emit a highpitched keening whistle. The shaman conducts an intricate dance around them, simultaneously chanting an ancient summoning mantra.</p><p>The hunt is the final part of the initiation of adolescent aarakocra to adulthood and often takes the tribe far from their normal teritory. The target is always a <a href=\"/appendix/drakalsi\">silt drake</a>. The hunt is the only time the females leave the relative safety of the nest. Even an evil tribe will not interfere with a tribe on a hunt. An air elemental is often summoned to help find the drake, but never takes part in the actual combat. Although the adult members of the tribe take part in the initial phases of the combat, it is the initiates who deliver the final, killing blows to me drake. Scars from the hunt are considered a mark of pride among all aarakocra.</p><p>The females spend about eight months of the year incubating their eggs. Athasian aarakocra mate for life and a pair normally produces as many as 10 offspring. A female lays one egg a year. Constant incubation is not required because of the high daytime temperatures, so the females can maintain the nest and keep the tribe's treasure in order.</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Ecology:</b> Athasian aarakocra are high on the food chain and have no natural enemies other than <a href=\"/appendix/drakatha\">drakes</a>. Unless evil, aarakocra leave their own territory only to hunt the silt drake and return as soon as possible when the hunt is over. (Evil aarakocra attack others, as noted above.) Aarakocra eggs and hatchlings are sought after by wealthy land owners who wish to use the creatures as scouts and sentries. An egg can bring as much as 10 cp in Tyr's marketplace. Tribes that have had eggs or hatchlings stolen have long memories and sometimes take revenge against the thief at a later date. Captive aarakocra join any tribe they come in contact with.</p><p>Athasian aarakocra have a natural life span of 21-30 years.</p><p></p><br clear=\"all\" style=\"clear:both; height:0;\">\r\n","images":["<img src=\"grf/ds.gif\" width=\"150\" height=\"75\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Dark Sun\" title=\"Dark Sun\" align=\"right\">","<img src=\"img/aarakath.gif\" alt=\"Aarakocra (Athas)\" title=\"Aarakocra (Athas)\" border=\"0\" width=\"300\" height=\"360\" style=\"text-align:right;\" align=\"right\">","<img src=\"grf/add2_01.gif\" width=\"200\" height=\"56\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Advanced Dungeons & Dragons 2nd Edition\">"],"setting":"Dark Sun","statblock":{"Aarakocra (Athas)":{"Activity Cycle":"Day","Alignment":"Any","Armor Class":"7","Climate/Terrain":"Deep desert","Damage/Attack":"1d3/1d3 or by weapon","Diet":"Carnivore","Frequency":"Rare","Hit Dice":"2+2","Intelligence":"Average (8-10)","Magic Resistance":"Nil","Morale":"Steady (11)","Movement":"6, Fl 36 (C)","No. Appearing":"1d10","No. of Attacks":"2","Organization":"Tribal","Size":"M (20'+ wingspan)","Special Attacks":"Nil","Special Defenses":"Nil","THAC0":"17","Treasure":"Varies","XP Value":"65"}},"title":"Aarakocra (Athas)"},"sources":["2433"],"statblock_names":[],"title":"Aarakocra (Athas)","prev_key":"zygraat","next_key":"aarakocr","monster_path":"/appendix/aarakath"}}},"pageContext":{"monster_key":"saurial","monster_data":{"TSR":["2125","2166"],"fullBody":"  <table cellspacing=\"0\" cellpadding=\"0\"><tr class=\"bk\"><th> </th><th class=\"cn\">Finhead</th><th class=\"cn\">Bladeback</th><th class=\"cn\">Flyer</th><th class=\"cn\">Hornhead</th></tr><tr><th>Climate/Terrain:</th><td>Jungle</td><td>Jungle</td><td>Jungle/mountain</td><td>Jungle</td></tr><tr><th>Frequency:</th><td>Very rare</td><td>Very rare</td><td>Very rare</td><td>Very rare</td></tr><tr><th>Organization:</th><td>Community</td><td>Community</td><td>Community</td><td>Community</td></tr><tr><th>Activity Cycle:</th><td>Day</td><td>Day</td><td>Day</td><td>Day</td></tr><tr><th>Diet:</th><td>Omnivore</td><td>Vegetarian</td><td>Carnivore</td><td>Vegetarian</td></tr><tr><th>Intelligence:</th><td>Very (11-12)</td><td>Very (11-12)</td><td>Very (11-12)</td><td>Very (11-12)</td></tr><tr><th>Treasure:</th><td>Nil</td><td>Nil</td><td>Nil</td><td>Nil</td></tr><tr><th>Alignment:</th><td>Any</td><td>Any</td><td>Any</td><td>Any</td></tr><tr><th>No. Appearing:</th><td>1-6</td><td>1-4</td><td>2-8</td><td>1-2</td></tr><tr><th>Armor Class:</th><td>5</td><td>4</td><td>6</td><td>4</td></tr><tr><th>Movement:</th><td>12</td><td>10</td><td>9, Fl 24 (C)</td><td>10</td></tr><tr><th>Hit Dice:</th><td>2</td><td>2</td><td>2</td><td>4</td></tr><tr><th>THAC0:</th><td>19</td><td>19</td><td>19</td><td>17</td></tr><tr><th>No. of Attacks:</th><td>1 or 2</td><td>1 or 3</td><td>1 or 3</td><td>1 or 3</td></tr><tr><th>Damage/Attack:</th><td>By weapon</td><td>By weapon</td><td>By weapon</td><td>By weapon</td></tr><tr><th>Special Attacks:</th><td>See below</td><td>See below</td><td>See below</td><td>See below</td></tr><tr><th>Special Defenses:</th><td>See below</td><td>See below</td><td>See below</td><td>See below</td></tr><tr><th>Magic Resistance:</th><td>Nil</td><td>Nil</td><td>Nil</td><td>Nil</td></tr><tr><th>Size:</th><td>M (5' tall)</td><td>L (7' tall)</td><td>S (3' tall)</td><td>L (10' tall)</td></tr><tr><th>Morale:</th><td>Steady (12)</td><td>Steady (12)</td><td>Average (10)</td><td>Elite (14)</td></tr><tr><th>XP Value:</th><td>35</td><td>35</td><td>65</td><td>120</td></tr></table><p class=\"f\"><img src=\"/img/spc/saurfinh.gif\" width=\"300\" height=\"360\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Saurial, Finhead\" title=\"Saurial, Finhead\" style=\"float:left;\">Saurials are intelligent bipedal lizards descended from creatures similar to dinosaurs. Saurials are not native to the Realms, but originate from an alternate Prime Material Plane. Most saurials now in the Realms were kidnapped from their homes and brought to the Realms as slaves by the evil god Moander. Upon Moander's death, these saurials elected to remain in the Realms and make it their home. They live in a single village in the Lost Vale in the Desertsmouth Mountains east of Anauroch. They are still recovering physically and spiritually from the deprivations they suffered under Moander, so very few saurials travel far from the shelter of the Lost Vale, though this may change with the passing of the years and as their numbers increase.</p><p>There are many different races of saurials, but only finheads, bladebacks, flyers, and hornheads are currently in the Realms. These are the names provided by the natives of the Realms to these newcomers. The saurials' own names are a combination of noises and scents which do not translate well into mammalian speech.</p><p>All four races have brightly colored scales, sharp claws, and tails, but their body shapes otherwise vary considerably. A finhead is nearly human in shape, though shorter than most humans, with a tail just over half its body length and a pronounced fin on its head. A bladeback is taller and stockier with a series of large, sharp scales which extend from the top of its head, down its spine and along its nearly body-length tail. A flyer has a delicate frame, with smaller legs, a shorter tail and a flap of scalecovered flesh beneath each arm which serve as wings. So although ungainly on foot, a flyer is extremely graceful when airborne. A hornhead is a giant beast with a tail longer than its own body and sharp horns protruding both from its head and the great bony plate which protects its neck. All four of these races have scales of some shade of green and their back scales are mixed with yellow scales in patterns unique to each individual. Flyers sometimes feature a bolder red splotch around their necks. Only rarely is a pure white saurial born in each race.</p><p><img src=\"/img/spc/saurblad.gif\" width=\"300\" height=\"360\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Saurial, Bladeback\" title=\"Saurial, Bladeback\" style=\"float:right;\">All saurials have true infravision. They can detect heat wavelengths with their eyes, but they cannot see a cold object in the dark. Although they are not cold-blooded like true <a href=\"/appendix/lizard\">lizards</a>, saurials are not as efficient at keeping their blood warm as are Realms mammals. If exposed too long to freezing air, saurials go into a torpor called cold sleep. They fall asleep and their breathing slows until they may even appear dead. A saurial's ability to resist the cold sleep is based on its size. A 3-foot flyer succumbs to the cold sleep in 3 turns, while a 5-foot finhead succumbs in 5 turns, and so forth. If the saurial is bundled in insulating clothing, these times are doubled. A saurial in cold sleep returns to consciousness within an hour or two if it is brought to a warm place. A saurial left exposed to freezing weather for more than a day dies.</p><p>For daily activities saurials do not generally wear more than loin cloths and simple, loose cloaks as long as they are in a tropical climate. They do, however, wear ornate robes of fabric and animal hides for ceremonial occasions. They decorate their homes with wall hangings and floor coverings. Saurials are not comfortable in armor. To avoid the cold sleep saurials bundle up in colder regions. Tattoos are common, particularly among spellcasters, and depending on their race, saurial mages either carve special symbols into the bony plates of their body or tattoo them into their scales.</p><p>Saurials do not speak any Realms languages; indeed, to most humans they do not seem to speak at all, since their voices are pitched too high to be heard without magic. The emotions accompanying their words are emitted as scents that humans can often detect, so a human familiar with the saurials can often tell what one is feeling without knowing what one is saying. Saurials can hear human speech, but so far, none have learned the language, although many of their spellcasters can use magic to do so. One of their number, the paladin Dragonbait, understands Common because of his magical bond with the sellsword Alias of Westgate. The saurials. form of writing is to carve lines on sticks, which is used mostly for magic and important records.</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Combat:</b> <img src=\"/img/spc/saurflye.gif\" width=\"300\" height=\"360\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Saurial, Flyer\" title=\"Saurial, Flyer\" style=\"float:left;\">Saurials, like humans, fight with a variety of weapons, mainly determined by their character class. For example, spellcasters use magic, fighters use blades and missile weapons, and clerics favor blunt weapons or magic. Saurial-crafted blades have shorter grips and favor barb-like tips. Humans not used to such weapons suffer a -1 attack penalty with saurial blades, and saurials suffer a -1 attack penalty with human weapons.</p><p>If unarmed and severely pressed, saurials resort to ancient modes of attack. Finheads claw with both hands (1d3/1d3) or use their thick tail as a whip (1d2). Bladebacks use both claws (1d4/1d4) and swing at any rear attacker with their razored tail (1d6). Flyers claw and bite (1d2/1d2,1d2). Hornheads either claw (1d4/1d4) and swing their tail (2d4) or charge with their horns (2d6).</p><p>Saurial Armor Class is as listed for each of the individual races, and is a result of their own thick natural hides. Saurial Armor Class can be improved by means of armor, though this is an alien concept to saurials, and such armor would need to be custom-made for the creatures. Saurial Armor Class would only be improved if the Armor Class would be higher than the saurial's natural Armor Class. So a finback in leather armor would gain no benefit. Exceptional saurials have the same limitations as their character class. Saurial mages do not wear armor, and saurial thieves would be limited to the protection of leather armor, which would be insufficient for their protection and as such not used.</p><p>Because of the nature of the saurial senses, all saurials receive a +2 saving throw bonus against sound-based attacks, such as a <a href=\"/appendix/harpy\">harpy's</a> charm or a <i>shout</i> spell. They are more susceptible to gasbased attacks, including poison gas and <i>cloudkill</i> spells, and as such have a -2 penalty on all saving throws against these attack forms.</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Habitat/Society:</b> The adult saurials of the Lost Vale number 110 and consider themselves one tribe, although they are made up of different races. Leading and protecting this tribe are a hornhead wizard of 14th level named Grypht, Grypht's three apprentices, a bladeback priest of 7th level named Sweetleaf, who worships Chauntea in lieu of his own goddess of the harvest, and Sweetleaf's five acolytes. The renowned finhead paladin Dragonbait visits the valley as often as his adventures allow. The tribe's other adventurers were killed battling Moander in their original plane. The remaining members are villagers without adventuring skills. Most are farmers and hunters. There are weavers, carpenters, a stonemason, a blacksmith, and musicians among their numbers. Moander killed all their young but 20 more saurials have hatched since the evil god's death. The adults have worked hard to build their new village and to restore order, but they are still somber after their ordeal. They look for the next generation to bring joy back into their lives. The saurials harvest and gather enough food and keep warm and dry in small thatched huts, but they prefer solid single family dwellings of stone or wood. One by one, each family is building a home, and gradually adding extra rooms onto them.</p><p><img src=\"/img/spc/saurhorn.gif\" width=\"300\" height=\"360\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Saurial, Hornhead\" title=\"Saurial, Hornhead\" style=\"float:right;\">This outpost is the sole known established domain of saurials in the Realms. However, once the gap between the Realms and the saurials' home plane has been breeched, there is a chance that more saurials may appear in Faerûn, or that adventurers from this dimension may find their way to the saurial homeworld.</p><p>Saurials live in mixed groups with little conflict among the races, unlike the mammals of the Realms, which seem to have different nations for <a href=\"/appendix/elf\">elves</a>, <a href=\"/appendix/dwarf\">dwarves</a>, and men. Saurials think of themselves as saurials first, and their sub-race second, and recognize that the other races of saurials have as much to contribute to their community as their own race, if not more. Saurial communities consist of all types of the various races, though there tends to be fewer of the larger hornheads and bladebacks because of the food limitations. Even communities with one race of saurials treat all other races as brethren. The Realms domain of the Lost Vale has primarily finbacks, but also has a large number of flyers, and a smattering of bladebacks and hornheads, including their leader, Grypht.</p><p>The listed statistics are for common saurials, but like the races of the Realms, these creatures have a number of exceptional individuals whose abilities closely resemble those of exceptional fighters, priests, mages, and thieves. In random encounters outside the Lost Vale, for every ten &ldquo;common&rdquo; saurials encountered there is an individual of exceptional ability, either a fighter (40%), mage (40%), priest (10%), or thief (10%). These exceptional individuals are of levels 1-10. They are unarmored, but equipped with weapons according to the restrictions of their class. Saurial spell-casters may still cast their spells in this plane, and those who derive their abilities from gods may continue to do so if their god has a Realmsian equivalent.</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Ecology:</b> Saurials mate for life and can produce 1-2 eggs a year. Both male and female share the duties of keeping the eggs warm and safe, feeding the hatchlings, and training them. A saurial appears full grown within five years, but the experience that brings mental maturity takes as long to develop as it would in a human. Saurials live a very long time if in favorable conditions. Grypht is more than 200 years old, without the aid of magic. Hornheads and bladebacks require a lot of vegetation to survive, so they are careful to limit their numbers in small regions, while the Lost Vale's abundant wildlife can support many more finheads and flyers.</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Finbacks</b></p>  <p class=\"ni\">Finbacks tend to be alert, bright, active, curious, and emotional. They are good with their hands and have enough muscle for common work and defense. Exceptional finbacks are usually, though not always, fighters or fighter sub-classes. Finbacks tend to believe in ultimate concepts of good, evil, and truth, and see things in terms of black and white. They are enthusiatic about new tasks and adventures, and leap into dangerous situations before getting a full idea of what dangers await. Most saurials found outside the Lost Vale are likely to be finbacks.</p><p></p><p class=\"f\"><b>Hornheads</b></p>  <p class=\"ni\">Hornheads are large and powerful, and tend toward careful, rational planning and thought. While they are slow of speech and carefully choose their words, they are not slow of mind, and have an interest in the sciences and crafts such as blacksmithing and weapon-making. Exceptional individuals may be of any character class, but the most powerful hornhead in the Realms is a spell-caster.</p><p></p><p class=\"f\"><b>Bladebacks</b></p>  <p class=\"ni\">Bladebacks are social creatures, more than the other three races, and as such tend to congregate with other saurials more readily. They are the most straight-forward and trusting of the saurials, but understand saurial nature well enough to know what their comrades want. Bladebacks are slow to anger, but once riled are passionate fighters. They are slow to forgive slights and offenses, and have long memories. Within the saurial organization, bladebacks often rise to positions of power as leaders of the combined groups, or advisors to those leaders. Exceptional bladebacks are often priests.</p><p></p><p class=\"f\"><b>Flyers</b></p>  <p class=\"ni\">Flyers are nervous, noisy saurials, both irritable and irritating. They have the benefit of flight, and as such often flee rather than fight. Enthusiastic conversationalists, flyers natter on about whatever gossip comes to mind. Their role in the community is usually as scouts or messengers, but there have been flyer heroes in saurial history who have rescued their larger brethren on many occasions, as any flyer will repeatedly tell you. Exceptional flyers are usually fighters or thieves.</p><p></p><br clear=\"all\" style=\"clear:both; height:0;\">\r\n","images":["<img src=\"grf/fr.gif\" width=\"150\" height=\"75\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Forgotten Realms\" title=\"Forgotten Realms\" align=\"right\">","<img src=\"img/saurial.gif\" alt=\"Saurial\" title=\"Saurial\" border=\"0\" width=\"300\" height=\"360\" style=\"text-align:right;\" align=\"right\">","<img src=\"/img/spc/saurfinh.gif\" width=\"300\" height=\"360\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Saurial, Finhead\" title=\"Saurial, Finhead\" style=\"float:left;\">","<img src=\"/img/spc/saurblad.gif\" width=\"300\" height=\"360\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Saurial, Bladeback\" title=\"Saurial, Bladeback\" style=\"float:right;\">","<img src=\"/img/spc/saurflye.gif\" width=\"300\" height=\"360\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Saurial, Flyer\" title=\"Saurial, Flyer\" style=\"float:left;\">","<img src=\"/img/spc/saurhorn.gif\" width=\"300\" height=\"360\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Saurial, Hornhead\" title=\"Saurial, Hornhead\" style=\"float:right;\">","<img src=\"grf/add2_01.gif\" width=\"200\" height=\"56\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Advanced Dungeons & Dragons 2nd Edition\">"],"setting":"Forgotten Realms","statblock":{"Bladeback":{"Activity Cycle":"Day","Alignment":"Any","Armor Class":"4","Climate/Terrain":"Jungle","Damage/Attack":"By weapon","Diet":"Vegetarian","Frequency":"Very rare","Hit Dice":"2","Intelligence":"Very (11-12)","Magic Resistance":"Nil","Morale":"Steady (12)","Movement":"10","No. Appearing":"1-4","No. of Attacks":"1 or 3","Organization":"Community","Size":"L (7' tall)","Special Attacks":"See below","Special Defenses":"See below","THAC0":"19","Treasure":"Nil","XP Value":"35"},"Finhead":{"Activity Cycle":"Day","Alignment":"Any","Armor Class":"5","Climate/Terrain":"Jungle","Damage/Attack":"By weapon","Diet":"Omnivore","Frequency":"Very rare","Hit Dice":"2","Intelligence":"Very (11-12)","Magic Resistance":"Nil","Morale":"Steady (12)","Movement":"12","No. Appearing":"1-6","No. of Attacks":"1 or 2","Organization":"Community","Size":"M (5' tall)","Special Attacks":"See below","Special Defenses":"See below","THAC0":"19","Treasure":"Nil","XP Value":"35"},"Flyer":{"Activity Cycle":"Day","Alignment":"Any","Armor Class":"6","Climate/Terrain":"Jungle/mountain","Damage/Attack":"By weapon","Diet":"Carnivore","Frequency":"Very rare","Hit Dice":"2","Intelligence":"Very (11-12)","Magic Resistance":"Nil","Morale":"Average (10)","Movement":"9, Fl 24 (C)","No. Appearing":"2-8","No. of Attacks":"1 or 3","Organization":"Community","Size":"S (3' tall)","Special Attacks":"See below","Special Defenses":"See below","THAC0":"19","Treasure":"Nil","XP Value":"65"},"Hornhead":{"Activity Cycle":"Day","Alignment":"Any","Armor Class":"4","Climate/Terrain":"Jungle","Damage/Attack":"By weapon","Diet":"Vegetarian","Frequency":"Very rare","Hit Dice":"4","Intelligence":"Very (11-12)","Magic Resistance":"Nil","Morale":"Elite (14)","Movement":"10","No. Appearing":"1-2","No. of Attacks":"1 or 3","Organization":"Community","Size":"L (10' tall)","Special Attacks":"See below","Special Defenses":"See below","THAC0":"17","Treasure":"Nil","XP Value":"120"}},"title":"Saurial"},"sources":["2125","2166"],"statblock_names":[],"title":"Saurial","prev_key":"sauggoss","next_key":"sawflyde","monster_path":"/appendix/saurial"}},"staticQueryHashes":[],"slicesMap":{}}
