While the powers listed above are the most common, some aarakocra have different or additional powers.</p><p class=\"f\">A race of intelligent, birdlike creatures living in the deepest deserts of Athas, the rare Athasian <a href=\"/appendix/aarakocr\">aarakocra</a> spends its time soaring on thermals in search of food.</p><p>The aarakocra is 7 to 8 feet tall with a wingspan of 20 feet or more. Because of its large wingspan, an aarakocra can carry as much as 75% of its own body weight and still fly easily. An aarakocra can fly a short distance carrying a burden equaling 125% of its own body weight. The average body weight of a full grown male is 100 pounds and a female is 85 pounds.</p><p>Each wing has a &ldquo;hand&rdquo; at its midpoint, consisting of three fingers and an opposable thumb. The fourth finger forms the rigid leading edge of the wing. In flight the hands cannot be used, but on the ground the aarakocra can use its hands almost as a human would. The aarakocra's body is protected by a thin bony plate on the chest, much like a solid rib cage. Talons on its legs can be used as claws and can be retracted to reveal a second set of hands, also with three fingers and an opposable thumb. Except for the chest plate, the entire skeleton is hollow and extremely fragile.</p><p>From a distance, the Athasian aarakocra resembles a huge <a href=\"/appendix/bird\">vulture</a>. Its black eyes, set in the front of the head, provide excellent vision over a long range. The plumage is generally black with a white collar for adult males and black or brown with a smaller white collar for females. Adolescents are a mixture of brown and black. The beak is large and covers most of the head. Plumage begins at the crown of the head and is darker near the head, except for the collar. Athasian aarakocra speak their own language and the languages of vultures and other large birds. Some speak the common tongue (5% to 10% chance depending on how deep in the wastelands a tribe lives).</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Combat:</b> Aarakocra can fight in the air or on the ground. They prefer aerial combat since their bones are too fragile to withstand a solid blow from a human-sized opponent. In combat against creatures on the ground, they prefer to fly over their victim and drop weighted nets. Some aarakocra use darts to harass ground-based opponents.</p><p>If their opponents can fly, the aarakocra generally forgo the use of the net, although large groups sometimes use nets on flying creatures. Normally, aarakocra attack flying creatures with long spears, diving from above and allowing the momentum to carry the spear through the target. Such an attack doubles the damage if the aarakocra have been able to dive at least 50 feet. Only the very largest aarakocra can carry more than one of these spears, they can attack with both at once with no penalty, causing double damage on each strike. All diving attacks are made at +4 and should be treated as a charge attack. All other penalties and restrictions of charge attacks apply.</p><p>The effect of the aarakocra's nets depends on if the opponent is flying at the time it becomes entangled. Creatures on the ground that are hit by a net are entangled and unable to participate in any combat until they make a successful Strength check to get free of the net. Flying creatures hit by a net can no longer fly and immediately begin falling. If they cannot escape the net or use some magical means to arrest the fall, normal falling damage applies.</p><p>Unless victims are entangled in nets, aarakocra are cautious in ground combat. If the aarakocra outnumber their opponents they advance in a straight line and thrust with their spears. If outnumbered, or the opponents are particularly tough, the aarakocra withdraw. Victims entangled in nets are killed or incapacitated for use as food or ransom.</p><p>Athasian aarakocra are mindful of their physical limitations as well as their comparatively low psionic abilities. They do not normally initiate psionic combat. At the first sign of psionic powers from any of their victims, however, all aarakocra that have some ability will use whatever attack and defense modes they can in an attempt to destroy the threat. Large groups of is or more aarakocra may initiate psionic combat if their leaders feel they can win quickly and avoid physical combat.</p><p>In desperation, an aarakocra can attempt to bite an opponent in combat. Because of the unwieldiness of its beak, the aarakocra has a THAC0 of 18 if attacking with this appendage. Further, the birdman causes only 1d2 points of damage with the beak.</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Habitat/Society:</b> Athasian aarakocra live in tribes with 6-20 (2d8+4) members, depending on the prestige of the leader. The largest tribe ever recorded had 50 members. The tribal hunting territory depends on the size of the tribe, usually about 500 square miles for a tribe of 10 members. There are no rigid boundaries between tribes and border disputes are not uncommon.</p><p>Alignments of tribe members are similar to the alignment of the leader. A tribe that has a leader who is neutral good may have neutral good, chaotic good, lawful good, and true neutral members. A predominantly evil tribe does not recognize boundaries with other tribes and treats other tribes as inferior beings to be eliminated.</p><p>Athasian aarakocra aren't happy in enclosed spaces, but they they take refuge in a cave or building if necessary.</p><p>Nonevil tribes live in rocky aeries in the highest peaks they can find. Evil tribes are normally nomadic and use an aerie made by another tribe if they need to remain in an area for a long time, even if they have to evict the tribe that made the nest.</p><p>Aarakocra aren't friendly toward intruders in their territory, especially caravans. They try to extract a toll from the caravan for passage through the desert. Good-aligned tribes allow unhindered passage of caravans that pay a tribute. If someone refuses to pay the tribute, the aarakocra try to capture scouts or outriders from the party and hold them until an even larger tribute is paid. The payment may be either livestock or shiny objects. Aarakocra are smart enough not to be taken in by glass baubles instead of gems, although they cannot tell the difference between the more common gems and the rare ones.</p><p>Evil tribes ask for tribute and often attack a caravan whether it pays or not. Aarakocra always demand shiny objects such as stones. These tribes find humans and demihumans to be quite tasty and prefer them to other food.</p><p>Good-aligned tribes of aarakocra sometimes return a lost traveler to the edge of the desert after first removing any valuables the traveler may be carrying. On very rare occasions a tribe might return a lost group of travelers to the more frequently traveled parts of the desert, again after first taking any valuables as payment.</p><p>The oldest male is the leader of the tribal hunting party and has 4+4 Hit Dice. The oldest female is in charge of the tribal aerie and has 3+3 HD. In tribes that have more than 15 members, the next oldest aarakocra serves as shaman and has 3+3 HD; the shaman completes the triumvirate necessary for proper worship and the summoning of elementals. (Interestingly, no magic-using aarakocra has ever been recorded.) Tribes without a shaman cannot summon <a href=\"/appendix/element1\">air elementals</a>, which is an important part of aarakocra culture.</p><p>The shaman is the leader of the daily sun worship. Aarakocra worship the sun because it provides them with the thermals they need to soar in search of food. The shaman also leads the mystic rituals used to summon an air elemental. Summoning an air elemental is usually done only in preparation for the tribe's most sacred ceremony, the hunt. Small tribes must band together for this ceremony to allow the triumvirate to be formed.</p><p>The ceremony to summon an air elemental must be conducted at dawn and requires the oldest male and female to emit a highpitched keening whistle. The shaman conducts an intricate dance around them, simultaneously chanting an ancient summoning mantra.</p><p>The hunt is the final part of the initiation of adolescent aarakocra to adulthood and often takes the tribe far from their normal teritory. The target is always a <a href=\"/appendix/drakalsi\">silt drake</a>. The hunt is the only time the females leave the relative safety of the nest. Even an evil tribe will not interfere with a tribe on a hunt. An air elemental is often summoned to help find the drake, but never takes part in the actual combat. Although the adult members of the tribe take part in the initial phases of the combat, it is the initiates who deliver the final, killing blows to me drake. Scars from the hunt are considered a mark of pride among all aarakocra.</p><p>The females spend about eight months of the year incubating their eggs. Athasian aarakocra mate for life and a pair normally produces as many as 10 offspring. A female lays one egg a year. Constant incubation is not required because of the high daytime temperatures, so the females can maintain the nest and keep the tribe's treasure in order.</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Ecology:</b> Athasian aarakocra are high on the food chain and have no natural enemies other than <a href=\"/appendix/drakatha\">drakes</a>. Unless evil, aarakocra leave their own territory only to hunt the silt drake and return as soon as possible when the hunt is over. (Evil aarakocra attack others, as noted above.) Aarakocra eggs and hatchlings are sought after by wealthy land owners who wish to use the creatures as scouts and sentries. An egg can bring as much as 10 cp in Tyr's marketplace. Tribes that have had eggs or hatchlings stolen have long memories and sometimes take revenge against the thief at a later date. Captive aarakocra join any tribe they come in contact with.</p><p>Athasian aarakocra have a natural life span of 21-30 years.</p>\n","images":["<img src=\"grf/ds.gif\" width=\"150\" height=\"75\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Dark Sun\" title=\"Dark Sun\" align=\"right\">","<img src=\"img/aarakath.gif\" alt=\"Aarakocra (Athas)\" title=\"Aarakocra (Athas)\" border=\"0\" width=\"300\" height=\"360\" style=\"text-align:right;\" align=\"right\">","<img src=\"grf/add2_01.gif\" width=\"200\" height=\"56\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Advanced Dungeons & Dragons 2nd Edition\">"],"setting":"Dark Sun","statblock":{"Aarakocra (Athas)":{"Activity Cycle":"Day","Alignment":"Any","Armor Class":"7","Climate/Terrain":"Deep desert","Damage/Attack":"1d3/1d3 or by weapon","Diet":"Carnivore","Frequency":"Rare","Hit Dice":"2+2","Intelligence":"Average (8-10)","Magic Resistance":"Nil","Morale":"Steady (11)","Movement":"6, Fl 36 (C)","No. Appearing":"1d10","No. of Attacks":"2","Organization":"Tribal","Size":"M (20'+ wingspan)","Special Attacks":"Nil","Special Defenses":"Nil","THAC0":"17","Treasure":"Varies","XP Value":"65"}},"title":"Aarakocra (Athas)"},"sources":["2433"],"statblock_names":[],"title":"Aarakocra (Athas)","prev_key":"zygraat","next_key":"aarakocr","monster_path":"/appendix/aarakath"}}},"pageContext":{"monster_key":"famimyst","monster_data":{"TSR":["2501"],"fullBody":"  <table cellspacing=\"0\" cellpadding=\"0\"><tr class=\"bk\"><th> </th><th class=\"cn\">Aryth</th><th class=\"cn\">Bogan</th><th class=\"cn\">Fylgar</th><th class=\"cn\">Gretch</th><th class=\"cn\">Ulzaq</th></tr><tr><th>Climate/Terrain:</th><td>Any</td><td>Any</td><td>Any</td><td>Any</td><td>Any</td></tr><tr><th>Frequency:</th><td>Very rare</td><td>Very rare</td><td>Very rare</td><td>Very rare</td><td>Very rare</td></tr><tr><th>Organization:</th><td>Solitary</td><td>Solitary</td><td>Solitary</td><td>Solitary</td><td>Solitary</td></tr><tr><th>Activity Cycle:</th><td>Day</td><td>Any</td><td>Day</td><td>Day</td><td>Night</td></tr><tr><th>Diet:</th><td>Omnivore</td><td>Omnivore</td><td>Omnivore</td><td>Omnivore</td><td>Omnivore</td></tr><tr><th>Intelligence:</th><td>High (13)</td><td>Very (11)</td><td>Very (11)</td><td>Very (12)</td><td>Low (6)</td></tr><tr><th>Treasure:</th><td>Q</td><td>Q</td><td>Q</td><td>Q</td><td>Q</td></tr><tr><th>Alignment:</th><td>Any good</td><td>Any evil</td><td>Any lawful</td><td>Any neutral</td><td>Any chaotic</td></tr><tr><th>No. Appearing:</th><td>1</td><td>1</td><td>1</td><td>1</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><th>Armor Class:</th><td>0</td><td>0</td><td>0</td><td>0</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><th>Movement:</th><td>9, Fl 18 (B)</td><td>12, Fl 30 (A)</td><td>6, Fl 24 (A)</td><td>15, Fl 18 (C)</td><td>6</td></tr><tr><th>Hit Dice:</th><td>3</td><td>3</td><td>3</td><td>3</td><td>3</td></tr><tr><th>THAC0:</th><td>17</td><td>17</td><td>17</td><td>17</td><td>17</td></tr><tr><th>No. of Attacks:</th><td>1</td><td>1</td><td>1</td><td>1</td><td>3 or 1</td></tr><tr><th>Damage/Attack:</th><td>1d4 (tail)</td><td>1d4 (bite) or 1d3 (tail)</td><td>1d4 (bite) or 1d4 (tail)</td><td>1d4 (bite) or 1d4 (tail)</td><td>1d2 (claw)/1d2 (claw)/1d4 (bite) or 1d4 (tail)</td></tr><tr><th>Special Attacks:</th><td>Sleep</td><td>Charm, poison</td><td>Nil</td><td>Dexterity drain, slow</td><td>Strength drain, confusion</td></tr><tr><th>Special Defenses:</th><td>See below</td><td>See below</td><td>See below</td><td>See below</td><td>See below</td></tr><tr><th>Magic Resistance:</th><td>Nil</td><td>Nil</td><td>Nil</td><td>Nil</td><td>Nil</td></tr><tr><th>Size:</th><td>T (1' tall)</td><td>T (1' tall)</td><td>T (2' tall)</td><td>T (2' tall)</td><td>T (2' tall)</td></tr><tr><th>Morale:</th><td>Steady (11)</td><td>Average (10)</td><td>Elite (i3)</td><td>Steady (11)</td><td>Average (10)</td></tr><tr><th>XP Value:</th><td>2,000</td><td>2,000</td><td>975</td><td>1,400</td><td>2,000</td></tr></table><p class=\"f\">Although the unique familiars of Mystara look like tiny humanoid creatures, these are actually the normal forms Immortals take when they visit the Prime Material Plane on special missions or to perform acts of penance. As a familiar, the Immortal serves a mortal master: a wizard of similar alignment. <i>Note that text in this entry refers only to the five special familiars listed here, not to regular wizard familiars.</i></p><p>The five types of familiar correspond to the five spheres of the Immortals. Each of these spheres corresponds roughly to a particular alignment. The chart below shows the familiar type that represents each sphere/alignment.</p><table class=\"ip\"><tr class=\"bk\"><th>Familiar</th><th>Sphere</th><th>Alignment</th></tr><tr><td>ulzaq</td><td>energy</td><td>chaos</td></tr><tr><td>bogan</td><td>entropy</td><td>evil</td></tr><tr><td>fylgar</td><td>matter</td><td>law</td></tr><tr><td>aryth</td><td>thought</td><td>good</td></tr><tr><td>gretch</td><td>time</td><td>neutral</td></tr></table><p>Immortals do not follow these classifications exclusively; for example, an Immortal of thought might choose to take the form of a fylgar. As a familiar, then, it would possess connections to both law (for fylgars) and good (for its thought sphere), making it a fylgar of lawful good alignment.</p><p>The tiny humanoids all have small wings and an assortment of powers, but each type of familiar boasts its own unique strengths, weaknesses, and physical features.</p><p>While it remains a willing (and magically bound) servant, a familiar can communicate telepathically with its master for up to 1 mile. In addition, a master within that range can use all the familiar's senses (including infravision) and gains a +3 bonus to all saving throws while in physical contact with it.</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Combat:</b> In battle, a familiar attacks with its tail and bite. (The ulzaq may use its claws as well.) Damage varies with the type of familiar, and each type has special combat abilities.</p><p>All familiars are immune to nonmagical weapons, as well as cold- and fire-based attacks. They can become invisible (per the spell <i>invisibility</i>) and can cast <i>detect evil</i> and <i>detect magic</i> at will. These creatures all have infravision with a 60-foot range. Each can regenerate 1 hit point of damage per round (as with the <i>regenerate</i> spell) and pass this ability on to their masters no more than 10 feet away. Familiars all use their magical abilities as they were 21st-level wizards.</p><p>If a familiar ever falls to 0 hit points, its body on the Prime Material Plane is destroyed, and its life-force returns to its home plane. The character whom the creature served will not be granted another familiar for at least one year and suffers the permanent loss of 1d4+1 hit points due to the shattering of the mystic connection upon the familiar's death.</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Habitat/Society:</b> The familiars of Mystara serve their masters out of either choice or duty, depending on the reason they were sent to the Prime Material Plane. In most cases, a familiar allows a wizard to bind it into service with a <i>find familiar</i> spell. Unlike most such creatures, however, Immortal familiars often choose their masters carefully, either searching out a wizard of the proper alignment who is trying to summon a familiar, or even presenting themselves to a chosen wizard and telling this character to cast the spell. A completed spell binds Immortal familiars just as it would any other familiar.</p><p>Certain high-level wizards have been known to bind an unwilling familiar to their service; only a few know the exact method to perform such a binding. This very risky procedure involves long, dangerous, and costly magical opera1ions and produces a weaker bond than if the candidate were willing. If such a familiar ever escapes its magical bindings, it will focus all of its abilities on punishing its former captor.</p><p>Once per week, a familiar may use its special Immortal knowledge and insight to help its master make an important decision. The aid it gives equates to that of a <i>commune</i> spell.</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Ecology:</b> Although in their Immortal forms, familiars do not need sustenance, while on the Prime Material Plane they need rest, food, and drink to survive, just like nonmagical creatures.</p><p>Familiars can speak, but rarely choose to communicate with anyone except their masters. They normally assist their masters in all manner of tasks, from magical experiments to epic quests. Their special abilities make them adept at spying and scouting enemy camps. Because of the harm a familiar's death inflicts on its master, wizards seldom use them as guards or warriors.</p><p>Familiars make their homes wherever their masters live, and the two seldom stray far from each other.</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Aryth</b></p>  <p class=\"ni\">Aryths have the most unassuming appearance of any familiar. These tiny humanoids (1 foot tall) have bright green eyes and translucent skin the color of black pearl. The aryth's long tail and delicate wings seem thin almost to the point of invisibility.</p><p>An aryth can polymorph into either a spider monkey or a sparrow (per the spell <i>polymorph self</i>). In combat, the familiar attacks with its tail, which contains hundreds of tiny soporific stingers in its tip. Anyone struck by the tail suffers 1d4 points of damage and must make a successful saving throw vs. spell or fall asleep for 2d4 rounds.</p><p>The amazingly perceptive aryth can cast <i>detect lie</i> at will. In addition, it can use a <i>protection from evil 10-foot radius</i> spell three times per day. An aryth never willingly serves a master not of good alignment.</p><p></p><p class=\"f\"><b>Bogan</b></p>  <p class=\"ni\">The tiny bogan has sharp, humanoid features. Its skin and four petite wings bear the mottled blue-green hue of the <a href=\"/appendix/drgnfly\">dragonfly</a>, while its short, scaly tail is either bright blue or green. Its eyes, large and blue, help make this creature remarkably attractive. In fact, many mortals have met their doom after becoming infatuated with - then betrayed by - one of these beauties.</p><p>A bogan can polymorph into a <a href=\"/appendix/snake\">garter snake</a> and a macaw. In combat, it either lashes out with a tail that boasts a knife-sharp edge along two-thirds of its length or it bites with envenomed teeth. Anyone the bogan bites must make a saving throw vs. paralyzation or shake uncontrollably for 1d4 rounds (-2 penalty to attack). Bogans themselves are immune to poison.</p><p>These cunning familiars can cast <i>charm person</i> three times a day. They will talk to anyone they feel they can manipulate or hurt, occasionally even allowing themselves to be bound to good-aligned wizards in the hopes of eventually bringing about their master's downfall.</p><p></p><p class=\"f\"><b>Fylgar</b></p>  <p class=\"ni\">Fylgars, the most attractive familiars, have large, brightly colored wings and rounded, childlike features framed by curly hair. Their long catlike tails bear a coat of pastel, soft, feathery fur. Even in harsh conditions, they wear light, gauzy garments.</p><p>Fylgars can polymorph themselves to either black <a href=\"/appendix/catsmall\">cats</a> or <a href=\"/appendix/hawk\">hawks</a>. They have extremely quick reflexes (improving all their initiative rolls by +1), and are extraordinarily agile fliers. When attacking with their long, whiplike tails (natural form only), these familiars gain a +4 to attack rolls.</p><p>Three times a day, fylars can cast <i>invisibility, 10-foot radius</i>, and they can use <i>detect invisibility</i> at will. They only willingly serve lawful masters; in fact, some have fallen deathly ill when forced to serve one of chaotic alignment. Fylgars despair over the vicious acts of the ulzaqs and attempt to send such creatures back to their home plane whenever possible.</p><p></p><p class=\"f\"><b>Gretch</b></p>  <p class=\"ni\">The lumpy, grayish gretch bears small, pointed horns, oversized hands, and a barbed tail. Its short but powerful leathery wings, though functional, do not permit it to fly well.Gretches can polymorph at will into either <a href=\"/appendix/raven\">ravens</a> or giant <a href=\"/appendix/rat\">rats</a>. If not polymorphed, the creature attacks with its poisonous tail. Victims hit by the tail must make a saving throw vs. poison: Failing means losing 1 point of Dexterity per hit. They can regain lost Dexterity at a rate of 1 point per turn, starting one turn after the loss of the last point. A victim whose dexterity drops to 3 falls unconscious and remains so until the ability score returns to at least 4. The gretch is immune to mind-affecting spells. Once a day it may cast <i>slow</i> on foes.</p><p>These familiars feel less choosy about the alignment of their masters than the other Immortal familiars do. Although they prefer to serve one of neutral alignment, a gretch will become bound to the master it thinks will make the fewest demands of it. Gretches enjoy practical jokes, so any wizard who forcible binds one into service is well advised to keep alert, lest one of the familiar's jokes &ldquo;accidentally&rdquo; harms (or kills) the master.</p><p></p><p class=\"f\"><b>Ulzaq</b></p>  <p class=\"ni\">By far the ugliest of the familiars, ulzaqs possess hideous, misshapen features, scaly yellow-brown skin, and gnarled horns sprouting from their tiny heads. Their vestigial leathery wings do not permit them to fly. Ulzaqs perpetually cover themselves in mud and filth, as one of their main pastimes is diving into dirt, trash, and other forms of refuse.</p><p>An ulzaq can polymorph itself at will into a <a href=\"/appendix/bat\">bat</a> or <a href=\"/appendix/frog\">frog</a>. In normal form, the creature attacks with filthy talons and vicious fangs. Whatever the ulzaq's form, its bite wounds drain 1 point of the victim's Strength per hit (negated by a successful saving throw vs. poison). Characters can regain lost Strength at a rate of 1 point per turn, starting one turn after the loss of the last point. A victim whose Strength drops to 3 falls unconscious and cannot be awakened until the ability score rises to 4.</p><p>These familiars are immune to electrical attacks. Once per day, an ulzaq can cause confusion (per the spell <i>confusion</i>).</p><p>Petty and venal creatures, ulzaqs wallow in the misery of others. Many search out weak masters, who often fall prey to their manipulations and end up doing the familiar's sinister bidding. Ulzaqs love to torture or plague a target for weeks before causing this victim's disgrace and violent death.</p><p>Ulzaqs hate fylgars as much as fylgars detest them. An ulzaq attacks this enemy on sight, taking the time to torture the fylgar, if possible; the vicious creatures especially like to pluck the feathers from the wings of a fylgar captive. In general, they destroy the beauty in anything they see.</p>\n","images":["<img src=\"grf/ms.gif\" width=\"150\" height=\"75\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Mystara\" title=\"Mystara\" align=\"right\">","<img src=\"img/famimyst.gif\" alt=\"Familiar (Mystara)\" title=\"Familiar (Mystara)\" border=\"0\" width=\"300\" height=\"360\" style=\"text-align:right;\" align=\"right\">","<img src=\"grf/add2_01.gif\" width=\"200\" height=\"56\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Advanced Dungeons & Dragons 2nd Edition\">"],"setting":"Mystara","statblock":{"Aryth":{"Activity Cycle":"Day","Alignment":"Any good","Armor Class":"0","Climate/Terrain":"Any","Damage/Attack":"1d4 (tail)","Diet":"Omnivore","Frequency":"Very rare","Hit Dice":"3","Intelligence":"High (13)","Magic Resistance":"Nil","Morale":"Steady (11)","Movement":"9, Fl 18 (B)","No. Appearing":"1","No. of Attacks":"1","Organization":"Solitary","Size":"T (1' tall)","Special Attacks":"Sleep","Special Defenses":"See below","THAC0":"17","Treasure":"Q","XP Value":"2,000"},"Bogan":{"Activity Cycle":"Any","Alignment":"Any evil","Armor Class":"0","Climate/Terrain":"Any","Damage/Attack":"1d4 (bite) or 1d3 (tail)","Diet":"Omnivore","Frequency":"Very rare","Hit Dice":"3","Intelligence":"Very (11)","Magic Resistance":"Nil","Morale":"Average (10)","Movement":"12, Fl 30 (A)","No. Appearing":"1","No. of Attacks":"1","Organization":"Solitary","Size":"T (1' tall)","Special Attacks":"Charm, poison","Special Defenses":"See below","THAC0":"17","Treasure":"Q","XP Value":"2,000"},"Fylgar":{"Activity Cycle":"Day","Alignment":"Any lawful","Armor Class":"0","Climate/Terrain":"Any","Damage/Attack":"1d4 (bite) or 1d4 (tail)","Diet":"Omnivore","Frequency":"Very rare","Hit Dice":"3","Intelligence":"Very (11)","Magic Resistance":"Nil","Morale":"Elite (i3)","Movement":"6, Fl 24 (A)","No. Appearing":"1","No. of Attacks":"1","Organization":"Solitary","Size":"T (2' tall)","Special Attacks":"Nil","Special Defenses":"See below","THAC0":"17","Treasure":"Q","XP Value":"975"},"Gretch":{"Activity Cycle":"Day","Alignment":"Any neutral","Armor Class":"0","Climate/Terrain":"Any","Damage/Attack":"1d4 (bite) or 1d4 (tail)","Diet":"Omnivore","Frequency":"Very rare","Hit Dice":"3","Intelligence":"Very (12)","Magic Resistance":"Nil","Morale":"Steady (11)","Movement":"15, Fl 18 (C)","No. Appearing":"1","No. of Attacks":"1","Organization":"Solitary","Size":"T (2' tall)","Special Attacks":"Dexterity drain, slow","Special Defenses":"See below","THAC0":"17","Treasure":"Q","XP Value":"1,400"},"Ulzaq":{"Activity Cycle":"Night","Alignment":"Any chaotic","Armor Class":"0","Climate/Terrain":"Any","Damage/Attack":"1d2 (claw)/1d2 (claw)/1d4 (bite) or 1d4 (tail)","Diet":"Omnivore","Frequency":"Very rare","Hit Dice":"3","Intelligence":"Low (6)","Magic Resistance":"Nil","Morale":"Average (10)","Movement":"6","No. Appearing":"1","No. of Attacks":"3 or 1","Organization":"Solitary","Size":"T (2' tall)","Special Attacks":"Strength drain, confusion","Special Defenses":"See below","THAC0":"17","Treasure":"Q","XP Value":"2,000"}},"title":"Familiar (Mystara)"},"sources":["2501"],"statblock_names":[],"title":"Familiar (Mystara)","prev_key":"falcfire","next_key":"famipseu","monster_path":"/appendix/famimyst"}},"staticQueryHashes":[],"slicesMap":{}}
