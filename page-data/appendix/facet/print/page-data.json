While the powers listed above are the most common, some aarakocra have different or additional powers.</p><p class=\"f\">A race of intelligent, birdlike creatures living in the deepest deserts of Athas, the rare Athasian <a href=\"/appendix/aarakocr\">aarakocra</a> spends its time soaring on thermals in search of food.</p><p>The aarakocra is 7 to 8 feet tall with a wingspan of 20 feet or more. Because of its large wingspan, an aarakocra can carry as much as 75% of its own body weight and still fly easily. An aarakocra can fly a short distance carrying a burden equaling 125% of its own body weight. The average body weight of a full grown male is 100 pounds and a female is 85 pounds.</p><p>Each wing has a &ldquo;hand&rdquo; at its midpoint, consisting of three fingers and an opposable thumb. The fourth finger forms the rigid leading edge of the wing. In flight the hands cannot be used, but on the ground the aarakocra can use its hands almost as a human would. The aarakocra's body is protected by a thin bony plate on the chest, much like a solid rib cage. Talons on its legs can be used as claws and can be retracted to reveal a second set of hands, also with three fingers and an opposable thumb. Except for the chest plate, the entire skeleton is hollow and extremely fragile.</p><p>From a distance, the Athasian aarakocra resembles a huge <a href=\"/appendix/bird\">vulture</a>. Its black eyes, set in the front of the head, provide excellent vision over a long range. The plumage is generally black with a white collar for adult males and black or brown with a smaller white collar for females. Adolescents are a mixture of brown and black. The beak is large and covers most of the head. Plumage begins at the crown of the head and is darker near the head, except for the collar. Athasian aarakocra speak their own language and the languages of vultures and other large birds. Some speak the common tongue (5% to 10% chance depending on how deep in the wastelands a tribe lives).</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Combat:</b> Aarakocra can fight in the air or on the ground. They prefer aerial combat since their bones are too fragile to withstand a solid blow from a human-sized opponent. In combat against creatures on the ground, they prefer to fly over their victim and drop weighted nets. Some aarakocra use darts to harass ground-based opponents.</p><p>If their opponents can fly, the aarakocra generally forgo the use of the net, although large groups sometimes use nets on flying creatures. Normally, aarakocra attack flying creatures with long spears, diving from above and allowing the momentum to carry the spear through the target. Such an attack doubles the damage if the aarakocra have been able to dive at least 50 feet. Only the very largest aarakocra can carry more than one of these spears, they can attack with both at once with no penalty, causing double damage on each strike. All diving attacks are made at +4 and should be treated as a charge attack. All other penalties and restrictions of charge attacks apply.</p><p>The effect of the aarakocra's nets depends on if the opponent is flying at the time it becomes entangled. Creatures on the ground that are hit by a net are entangled and unable to participate in any combat until they make a successful Strength check to get free of the net. Flying creatures hit by a net can no longer fly and immediately begin falling. If they cannot escape the net or use some magical means to arrest the fall, normal falling damage applies.</p><p>Unless victims are entangled in nets, aarakocra are cautious in ground combat. If the aarakocra outnumber their opponents they advance in a straight line and thrust with their spears. If outnumbered, or the opponents are particularly tough, the aarakocra withdraw. Victims entangled in nets are killed or incapacitated for use as food or ransom.</p><p>Athasian aarakocra are mindful of their physical limitations as well as their comparatively low psionic abilities. They do not normally initiate psionic combat. At the first sign of psionic powers from any of their victims, however, all aarakocra that have some ability will use whatever attack and defense modes they can in an attempt to destroy the threat. Large groups of is or more aarakocra may initiate psionic combat if their leaders feel they can win quickly and avoid physical combat.</p><p>In desperation, an aarakocra can attempt to bite an opponent in combat. Because of the unwieldiness of its beak, the aarakocra has a THAC0 of 18 if attacking with this appendage. Further, the birdman causes only 1d2 points of damage with the beak.</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Habitat/Society:</b> Athasian aarakocra live in tribes with 6-20 (2d8+4) members, depending on the prestige of the leader. The largest tribe ever recorded had 50 members. The tribal hunting territory depends on the size of the tribe, usually about 500 square miles for a tribe of 10 members. There are no rigid boundaries between tribes and border disputes are not uncommon.</p><p>Alignments of tribe members are similar to the alignment of the leader. A tribe that has a leader who is neutral good may have neutral good, chaotic good, lawful good, and true neutral members. A predominantly evil tribe does not recognize boundaries with other tribes and treats other tribes as inferior beings to be eliminated.</p><p>Athasian aarakocra aren't happy in enclosed spaces, but they they take refuge in a cave or building if necessary.</p><p>Nonevil tribes live in rocky aeries in the highest peaks they can find. Evil tribes are normally nomadic and use an aerie made by another tribe if they need to remain in an area for a long time, even if they have to evict the tribe that made the nest.</p><p>Aarakocra aren't friendly toward intruders in their territory, especially caravans. They try to extract a toll from the caravan for passage through the desert. Good-aligned tribes allow unhindered passage of caravans that pay a tribute. If someone refuses to pay the tribute, the aarakocra try to capture scouts or outriders from the party and hold them until an even larger tribute is paid. The payment may be either livestock or shiny objects. Aarakocra are smart enough not to be taken in by glass baubles instead of gems, although they cannot tell the difference between the more common gems and the rare ones.</p><p>Evil tribes ask for tribute and often attack a caravan whether it pays or not. Aarakocra always demand shiny objects such as stones. These tribes find humans and demihumans to be quite tasty and prefer them to other food.</p><p>Good-aligned tribes of aarakocra sometimes return a lost traveler to the edge of the desert after first removing any valuables the traveler may be carrying. On very rare occasions a tribe might return a lost group of travelers to the more frequently traveled parts of the desert, again after first taking any valuables as payment.</p><p>The oldest male is the leader of the tribal hunting party and has 4+4 Hit Dice. The oldest female is in charge of the tribal aerie and has 3+3 HD. In tribes that have more than 15 members, the next oldest aarakocra serves as shaman and has 3+3 HD; the shaman completes the triumvirate necessary for proper worship and the summoning of elementals. (Interestingly, no magic-using aarakocra has ever been recorded.) Tribes without a shaman cannot summon <a href=\"/appendix/element1\">air elementals</a>, which is an important part of aarakocra culture.</p><p>The shaman is the leader of the daily sun worship. Aarakocra worship the sun because it provides them with the thermals they need to soar in search of food. The shaman also leads the mystic rituals used to summon an air elemental. Summoning an air elemental is usually done only in preparation for the tribe's most sacred ceremony, the hunt. Small tribes must band together for this ceremony to allow the triumvirate to be formed.</p><p>The ceremony to summon an air elemental must be conducted at dawn and requires the oldest male and female to emit a highpitched keening whistle. The shaman conducts an intricate dance around them, simultaneously chanting an ancient summoning mantra.</p><p>The hunt is the final part of the initiation of adolescent aarakocra to adulthood and often takes the tribe far from their normal teritory. The target is always a <a href=\"/appendix/drakalsi\">silt drake</a>. The hunt is the only time the females leave the relative safety of the nest. Even an evil tribe will not interfere with a tribe on a hunt. An air elemental is often summoned to help find the drake, but never takes part in the actual combat. Although the adult members of the tribe take part in the initial phases of the combat, it is the initiates who deliver the final, killing blows to me drake. Scars from the hunt are considered a mark of pride among all aarakocra.</p><p>The females spend about eight months of the year incubating their eggs. Athasian aarakocra mate for life and a pair normally produces as many as 10 offspring. A female lays one egg a year. Constant incubation is not required because of the high daytime temperatures, so the females can maintain the nest and keep the tribe's treasure in order.</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Ecology:</b> Athasian aarakocra are high on the food chain and have no natural enemies other than <a href=\"/appendix/drakatha\">drakes</a>. Unless evil, aarakocra leave their own territory only to hunt the silt drake and return as soon as possible when the hunt is over. (Evil aarakocra attack others, as noted above.) Aarakocra eggs and hatchlings are sought after by wealthy land owners who wish to use the creatures as scouts and sentries. An egg can bring as much as 10 cp in Tyr's marketplace. Tribes that have had eggs or hatchlings stolen have long memories and sometimes take revenge against the thief at a later date. Captive aarakocra join any tribe they come in contact with.</p><p>Athasian aarakocra have a natural life span of 21-30 years.</p><p></p><br clear=\"all\" style=\"clear:both; height:0;\">\r\n","images":["<img src=\"grf/ds.gif\" width=\"150\" height=\"75\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Dark Sun\" title=\"Dark Sun\" align=\"right\">","<img src=\"img/aarakath.gif\" alt=\"Aarakocra (Athas)\" title=\"Aarakocra (Athas)\" border=\"0\" width=\"300\" height=\"360\" style=\"text-align:right;\" align=\"right\">","<img src=\"grf/add2_01.gif\" width=\"200\" height=\"56\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Advanced Dungeons & Dragons 2nd Edition\">"],"setting":"Dark Sun","statblock":{"Aarakocra (Athas)":{"Activity Cycle":"Day","Alignment":"Any","Armor Class":"7","Climate/Terrain":"Deep desert","Damage/Attack":"1d3/1d3 or by weapon","Diet":"Carnivore","Frequency":"Rare","Hit Dice":"2+2","Intelligence":"Average (8-10)","Magic Resistance":"Nil","Morale":"Steady (11)","Movement":"6, Fl 36 (C)","No. Appearing":"1d10","No. of Attacks":"2","Organization":"Tribal","Size":"M (20'+ wingspan)","Special Attacks":"Nil","Special Defenses":"Nil","THAC0":"17","Treasure":"Varies","XP Value":"65"}},"title":"Aarakocra (Athas)"},"sources":["2433"],"statblock_names":[],"title":"Aarakocra (Athas)","prev_key":"zygraat","next_key":"aarakocr","monster_path":"/appendix/aarakath"}}},"pageContext":{"monster_key":"facet","monster_data":{"TSR":["2635"],"fullBody":"  <table cellspacing=\"0\" cellpadding=\"0\"><tr><th>Climate/Terrain:</th><td>Quasiplane of Salt</td></tr><tr><th>Frequency:</th><td>Uncommon</td></tr><tr><th>Organization:</th><td>Army</td></tr><tr><th>Activity Cycle:</th><td>Any</td></tr><tr><th>Diet:</th><td>Water</td></tr><tr><th>Intelligence:</th><td>Average (8-10)</td></tr><tr><th>Treasure:</th><td>Nil</td></tr><tr><th>Alignment:</th><td>Neutral</td></tr><tr><th>No. Appearing:</th><td>2d6</td></tr><tr><th>Armor Class:</th><td>4</td></tr><tr><th>Movement:</th><td>9</td></tr><tr><th>Hit Dice:</th><td>3 (see below)</td></tr><tr><th>THAC0:</th><td>17 (see below)</td></tr><tr><th>No. of Attacks:</th><td>2</td></tr><tr><th>Damage/Attack:</th><td>1d4/1d4 (see below)</td></tr><tr><th>Special Attacks:</th><td>Dehydration</td></tr><tr><th>Special Defenses:</th><td>Nil</td></tr><tr><th>Magic Resistance:</th><td>Nil</td></tr><tr><th>Size:</th><td>M (5' tall) (see below)</td></tr><tr><th>Morale:</th><td>Average (8-10)</td></tr><tr><th>XP Value:</th><td>175<br>Combined facet (2 member): 420<br>Combined facet (3 member): 1,400<br>Combined facet (4 member): 3,000<br>Combined facet (5 member): 6,000</td></tr></table><p class=\"f\">War is imminent on the Inner Planes, but most folks don't know it yet. A force of great power grows within the Quasielemental Plane of Salt. The vast army or beings known as facets is preparing a massive invasion of the Elemental Plane of Water.</p><p>Facets are multiple creatures of salt with a single intellence. Rather than individual organisms, the facets essentially comprise a singular creature with many detachable appendages. All facets are part of all other facets. THey work together the way the different portions of a singular individual do, never communicating but always in sync.</p><p>The oncoming conflict could happen only on the Inner Planes. It's a war that'll be waged by the facets from the plane of Salt against the very plane of Water itself. The strange thing is, it's a battle that may go on for quite some time before the creatures of Water even know it's happening.</p><p>See, the facets want to absorb all moisture, or so the chant says, and they've targeted the plane of Water as the perfect place to begin. When Water and Salt meet, the essences of these planes converge in a sea of extremely salty water. The facets wage their war there, leeching moisture away from the border-sea. As the facets absorb the liquids, ever more flows in from the plane of Water itself to replenish the border. Although the quantities involved (the amount of water and space) are infinity or nearly so, the potential exists for a great deal of Water's power and essence to be drawn slowly away. Further, because the absorption of water allows the facets to reproduce, the threat will only magnify as time passes.</p><p>Facets appear as 5-foot-tall, nearly featureless humanoids seemingly drawn of angular lines and composed entirely of salt crystals. They do not communicate with other creatures, nor seemingly with one another.</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Combat:</b> A single facet is dangerous enough to most living, organic creatures. Unfortunately, they are rarely encountered alone. Singly or collectively, the danger lies in the facet's ability to drain moisture from any source.</p><p>In combat, a facet strikes with two spindly limbs, each inflicting only 1d4 points of damage. However, the attack also leeches some moisture from any creature comprised partially of water (virtually any living thing except for elemental creatures of stone, fire, or air). The next round, creatures struck by the facet automatically lose an additional 1d4 points of damage as they suffer the wound's desiccating effect. The wounds from combat with a facet are known for the dry, chapped welts left behind.</p><p>If a bark who encounters a facet has already been injured from other attacks that opened bleeding wounds, he suffers 1d6 points of damage from the creature's salty strike, rather than 1d4. This is because the salt in the open wounds inflicts even more pain. However, the secondary damage of 1d4 points the following round does not increase.</p><p>Obviously, creatures made of water (such as water elementals) are particularly susceptible to a facet's attack. Against beings made solely or mostly of water, the blow inflicts 2d4 points of damage, and the secondary loss is likewise doubled to 2d4 points.</p><p>It's the secondary damage that sustains the facet as it draws water from an opponent's body into its own. When the total damage inflicted from the secondary attack equals the facet's own maximum hit points, it immediatly splits in two. Absorbing that amount of water allows it to create a new facet. This splitting process takes a full round in which neither facet can act. Once spilt, the two facets each have half the Hit Dice of the original, and it takes about a week for each facet to regain its full Hit Die potential.</p><p>After splitting, the original facet can continue to attack, but it usually cannot split again (see <q>Ecology</q> for details). The newly produced facet can split, but not until it reaches its full growth a week later. Thus, in a given conflict with moisture-laden foes, a group of facets may double, but their number generally won't grow any larger than that.</p><p>A spell like <i>create water</i>, cast upon a facet, allows it to split immediately (if the creature is able). <i>Transmute water to dust</i> instantly slays a facet, even a combined facet (see below), if it falls a saving throw.</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Habitat/Society:</b> It's easiest to think of all facets as a singular being. Only then can a body truly tumble to the utter lack of interaction and communication among the otherwise separate individuals, yet understand the total efficiency with which they work together.</p><p>About one-third of the total number of extant facets can be found inching their way through the border with the Elemental Plane of Water. Absolving the liquids in an ever-expanding horde. The rest are found in more centrally located portions of their own plane. Eventually, it seems, they will all march toward their goal.</p><p>Chant has it that a master facet somewhere in the plane (perhaps the original creature) controls the actions of all other facets. Such an idea gives hope that there might be a way to stop the legions of facets that threaten the plane of Water. It's probably too good to be true, however, for the facts seem to suggest otherwise. It's more likely that all facets are equal to one another, each sharing a collective consciousness and each performing as a mere extension of that consciousness.</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Ecology:</b> Thc facet is comprised entirely of salt crystals. Its sole motivation entails absorbing water. Water alone sustains and nourishes the creature, and the element's absence drives it with an all-consuming thirst. Water also enables it to reproduce, splitting in two to create another fully formed facet (see above). Most facets can split just once in their entire lives. However, one in five facets is able to reproduce twice, and one in 20 can reproduce three times &ndash; so the population always has the potential to continue to expand in greater and greater amounts.</p><p>As the facets march like an army toward the border with the Elemental Plane of Water, encountering larger and larger quantities of the life-sustaining liquid, folks calculate that their total number doubles every three weeks. Somewhere, sometime, this potential threat to the plane or Water (and possibly the rest of the multiverse) should be adressed by the powers that be &ndash; before it's too late.</p><h2>Combined Facet</h2><p class=\"f\">Facets have the ability to join their bodies together to become larger, composite entities. Up to five facets can assemble themselves into one gigantic creature. It takes 1d3 rounds to complete this action (and the same amount or time to separate again).</p><p>A combined facet has as many Hit Dice as its respective parts (so five facets can join to become a 15 HD creature). The new monster has the THAC0 commensurate with its new form, and damage inflicted is equal to the combined total of all the members (so a five-facet beast has a THAC0 of 5 and inflicts 5d4 points or damage with each of its attacks). Combined facets made of two or three members are size L, while those made of four or five members are size H. All other stats remain the same.</p><table class=\"ip\"><tr class=\"bk\"><th>Number of facets</th><th>HD</th><th> THAC0</th><th>Dam/Att</th><th>Size</th></tr><tr><td>l member</td><td>3</td><td>17</td><td>1d4/1d4</td><td>M (5')</td></tr><tr><td>2 member</td><td>6</td><td>15</td><td>2d4/2d4</td><td>L (8')</td></tr><tr><td>3 member</td><td>9</td><td>11</td><td>3d4/3d4</td><td>L (12')</td></tr><tr><td>4 member</td><td>12</td><td>9</td><td>4d4/4d4</td><td>H (15')</td></tr><tr><td>5 member</td><td>15</td><td>5</td><td>5d4/5d4</td><td>H (18')</td></tr></table><br clear=\"all\" style=\"clear:both; height:0;\">\r\n","images":["<img src=\"grf/ps.gif\" width=\"150\" height=\"75\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Planescape\" title=\"Planescape\" align=\"right\">","<img src=\"img/facet.gif\" alt=\"Facet\" title=\"Facet\" border=\"0\" width=\"300\" height=\"360\" style=\"text-align:right;\" align=\"right\">","<img src=\"grf/add2_01.gif\" width=\"200\" height=\"56\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Advanced Dungeons & Dragons 2nd Edition\">"],"setting":"Planescape","statblock":{"Facet":{"Activity Cycle":"Any","Alignment":"Neutral","Armor Class":"4","Climate/Terrain":"Quasiplane of Salt","Damage/Attack":"1d4/1d4 (see below)","Diet":"Water","Frequency":"Uncommon","Hit Dice":"3 (see below)","Intelligence":"Average (8-10)","Magic Resistance":"Nil","Morale":"Average (8-10)","Movement":"9","No. Appearing":"2d6","No. of Attacks":"2","Organization":"Army","Size":"M (5' tall) (see below)","Special Attacks":"Dehydration","Special Defenses":"Nil","THAC0":"17 (see below)","Treasure":"Nil","XP Value":"175<br>Combined facet (2 member): 420<br>Combined facet (3 member): 1,400<br>Combined facet (4 member): 3,000<br>Combined facet (5 member): 6,000"}},"title":"Facet"},"sources":["2635"],"statblock_names":[],"title":"Facet","prev_key":"eyewing","next_key":"fachansc","monster_path":"/appendix/facet"}},"staticQueryHashes":[],"slicesMap":{}}
