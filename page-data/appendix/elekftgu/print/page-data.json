While the powers listed above are the most common, some aarakocra have different or additional powers.</p><p class=\"f\">A race of intelligent, birdlike creatures living in the deepest deserts of Athas, the rare Athasian <a href=\"/appendix/aarakocr\">aarakocra</a> spends its time soaring on thermals in search of food.</p><p>The aarakocra is 7 to 8 feet tall with a wingspan of 20 feet or more. Because of its large wingspan, an aarakocra can carry as much as 75% of its own body weight and still fly easily. An aarakocra can fly a short distance carrying a burden equaling 125% of its own body weight. The average body weight of a full grown male is 100 pounds and a female is 85 pounds.</p><p>Each wing has a &ldquo;hand&rdquo; at its midpoint, consisting of three fingers and an opposable thumb. The fourth finger forms the rigid leading edge of the wing. In flight the hands cannot be used, but on the ground the aarakocra can use its hands almost as a human would. The aarakocra's body is protected by a thin bony plate on the chest, much like a solid rib cage. Talons on its legs can be used as claws and can be retracted to reveal a second set of hands, also with three fingers and an opposable thumb. Except for the chest plate, the entire skeleton is hollow and extremely fragile.</p><p>From a distance, the Athasian aarakocra resembles a huge <a href=\"/appendix/bird\">vulture</a>. Its black eyes, set in the front of the head, provide excellent vision over a long range. The plumage is generally black with a white collar for adult males and black or brown with a smaller white collar for females. Adolescents are a mixture of brown and black. The beak is large and covers most of the head. Plumage begins at the crown of the head and is darker near the head, except for the collar. Athasian aarakocra speak their own language and the languages of vultures and other large birds. Some speak the common tongue (5% to 10% chance depending on how deep in the wastelands a tribe lives).</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Combat:</b> Aarakocra can fight in the air or on the ground. They prefer aerial combat since their bones are too fragile to withstand a solid blow from a human-sized opponent. In combat against creatures on the ground, they prefer to fly over their victim and drop weighted nets. Some aarakocra use darts to harass ground-based opponents.</p><p>If their opponents can fly, the aarakocra generally forgo the use of the net, although large groups sometimes use nets on flying creatures. Normally, aarakocra attack flying creatures with long spears, diving from above and allowing the momentum to carry the spear through the target. Such an attack doubles the damage if the aarakocra have been able to dive at least 50 feet. Only the very largest aarakocra can carry more than one of these spears, they can attack with both at once with no penalty, causing double damage on each strike. All diving attacks are made at +4 and should be treated as a charge attack. All other penalties and restrictions of charge attacks apply.</p><p>The effect of the aarakocra's nets depends on if the opponent is flying at the time it becomes entangled. Creatures on the ground that are hit by a net are entangled and unable to participate in any combat until they make a successful Strength check to get free of the net. Flying creatures hit by a net can no longer fly and immediately begin falling. If they cannot escape the net or use some magical means to arrest the fall, normal falling damage applies.</p><p>Unless victims are entangled in nets, aarakocra are cautious in ground combat. If the aarakocra outnumber their opponents they advance in a straight line and thrust with their spears. If outnumbered, or the opponents are particularly tough, the aarakocra withdraw. Victims entangled in nets are killed or incapacitated for use as food or ransom.</p><p>Athasian aarakocra are mindful of their physical limitations as well as their comparatively low psionic abilities. They do not normally initiate psionic combat. At the first sign of psionic powers from any of their victims, however, all aarakocra that have some ability will use whatever attack and defense modes they can in an attempt to destroy the threat. Large groups of is or more aarakocra may initiate psionic combat if their leaders feel they can win quickly and avoid physical combat.</p><p>In desperation, an aarakocra can attempt to bite an opponent in combat. Because of the unwieldiness of its beak, the aarakocra has a THAC0 of 18 if attacking with this appendage. Further, the birdman causes only 1d2 points of damage with the beak.</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Habitat/Society:</b> Athasian aarakocra live in tribes with 6-20 (2d8+4) members, depending on the prestige of the leader. The largest tribe ever recorded had 50 members. The tribal hunting territory depends on the size of the tribe, usually about 500 square miles for a tribe of 10 members. There are no rigid boundaries between tribes and border disputes are not uncommon.</p><p>Alignments of tribe members are similar to the alignment of the leader. A tribe that has a leader who is neutral good may have neutral good, chaotic good, lawful good, and true neutral members. A predominantly evil tribe does not recognize boundaries with other tribes and treats other tribes as inferior beings to be eliminated.</p><p>Athasian aarakocra aren't happy in enclosed spaces, but they they take refuge in a cave or building if necessary.</p><p>Nonevil tribes live in rocky aeries in the highest peaks they can find. Evil tribes are normally nomadic and use an aerie made by another tribe if they need to remain in an area for a long time, even if they have to evict the tribe that made the nest.</p><p>Aarakocra aren't friendly toward intruders in their territory, especially caravans. They try to extract a toll from the caravan for passage through the desert. Good-aligned tribes allow unhindered passage of caravans that pay a tribute. If someone refuses to pay the tribute, the aarakocra try to capture scouts or outriders from the party and hold them until an even larger tribute is paid. The payment may be either livestock or shiny objects. Aarakocra are smart enough not to be taken in by glass baubles instead of gems, although they cannot tell the difference between the more common gems and the rare ones.</p><p>Evil tribes ask for tribute and often attack a caravan whether it pays or not. Aarakocra always demand shiny objects such as stones. These tribes find humans and demihumans to be quite tasty and prefer them to other food.</p><p>Good-aligned tribes of aarakocra sometimes return a lost traveler to the edge of the desert after first removing any valuables the traveler may be carrying. On very rare occasions a tribe might return a lost group of travelers to the more frequently traveled parts of the desert, again after first taking any valuables as payment.</p><p>The oldest male is the leader of the tribal hunting party and has 4+4 Hit Dice. The oldest female is in charge of the tribal aerie and has 3+3 HD. In tribes that have more than 15 members, the next oldest aarakocra serves as shaman and has 3+3 HD; the shaman completes the triumvirate necessary for proper worship and the summoning of elementals. (Interestingly, no magic-using aarakocra has ever been recorded.) Tribes without a shaman cannot summon <a href=\"/appendix/element1\">air elementals</a>, which is an important part of aarakocra culture.</p><p>The shaman is the leader of the daily sun worship. Aarakocra worship the sun because it provides them with the thermals they need to soar in search of food. The shaman also leads the mystic rituals used to summon an air elemental. Summoning an air elemental is usually done only in preparation for the tribe's most sacred ceremony, the hunt. Small tribes must band together for this ceremony to allow the triumvirate to be formed.</p><p>The ceremony to summon an air elemental must be conducted at dawn and requires the oldest male and female to emit a highpitched keening whistle. The shaman conducts an intricate dance around them, simultaneously chanting an ancient summoning mantra.</p><p>The hunt is the final part of the initiation of adolescent aarakocra to adulthood and often takes the tribe far from their normal teritory. The target is always a <a href=\"/appendix/drakalsi\">silt drake</a>. The hunt is the only time the females leave the relative safety of the nest. Even an evil tribe will not interfere with a tribe on a hunt. An air elemental is often summoned to help find the drake, but never takes part in the actual combat. Although the adult members of the tribe take part in the initial phases of the combat, it is the initiates who deliver the final, killing blows to me drake. Scars from the hunt are considered a mark of pride among all aarakocra.</p><p>The females spend about eight months of the year incubating their eggs. Athasian aarakocra mate for life and a pair normally produces as many as 10 offspring. A female lays one egg a year. Constant incubation is not required because of the high daytime temperatures, so the females can maintain the nest and keep the tribe's treasure in order.</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Ecology:</b> Athasian aarakocra are high on the food chain and have no natural enemies other than <a href=\"/appendix/drakatha\">drakes</a>. Unless evil, aarakocra leave their own territory only to hunt the silt drake and return as soon as possible when the hunt is over. (Evil aarakocra attack others, as noted above.) Aarakocra eggs and hatchlings are sought after by wealthy land owners who wish to use the creatures as scouts and sentries. An egg can bring as much as 10 cp in Tyr's marketplace. Tribes that have had eggs or hatchlings stolen have long memories and sometimes take revenge against the thief at a later date. Captive aarakocra join any tribe they come in contact with.</p><p>Athasian aarakocra have a natural life span of 21-30 years.</p>\n","images":["<img src=\"grf/ds.gif\" width=\"150\" height=\"75\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Dark Sun\" title=\"Dark Sun\" align=\"right\">","<img src=\"img/aarakath.gif\" alt=\"Aarakocra (Athas)\" title=\"Aarakocra (Athas)\" border=\"0\" width=\"300\" height=\"360\" style=\"text-align:right;\" align=\"right\">","<img src=\"grf/add2_01.gif\" width=\"200\" height=\"56\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Advanced Dungeons & Dragons 2nd Edition\">"],"setting":"Dark Sun","statblock":{"Aarakocra (Athas)":{"Activity Cycle":"Day","Alignment":"Any","Armor Class":"7","Climate/Terrain":"Deep desert","Damage/Attack":"1d3/1d3 or by weapon","Diet":"Carnivore","Frequency":"Rare","Hit Dice":"2+2","Intelligence":"Average (8-10)","Magic Resistance":"Nil","Morale":"Steady (11)","Movement":"6, Fl 36 (C)","No. Appearing":"1d10","No. of Attacks":"2","Organization":"Tribal","Size":"M (20'+ wingspan)","Special Attacks":"Nil","Special Defenses":"Nil","THAC0":"17","Treasure":"Varies","XP Value":"65"}},"title":"Aarakocra (Athas)"},"sources":["2433"],"statblock_names":[],"title":"Aarakocra (Athas)","prev_key":"zygraat","next_key":"aarakocr","monster_path":"/appendix/aarakath"}}},"pageContext":{"monster_key":"elekftgu","monster_data":{"TSR":["2166","9491"],"fullBody":"  <table cellspacing=\"0\" cellpadding=\"0\"><tr><th>Climate/Terrain:</th><td>Any</td></tr><tr><th>Frequency:</th><td>Very rare</td></tr><tr><th>Organization:</th><td>Solitary</td></tr><tr><th>Activity Cycle:</th><td>Any</td></tr><tr><th>Diet:</th><td>Fire, electricity, and heat</td></tr><tr><th>Intelligence:</th><td>Average (8-10)</td></tr><tr><th>Treasure:</th><td>One guarded object</td></tr><tr><th>Alignment:</th><td>Neutral</td></tr><tr><th>No. Appearing:</th><td>1</td></tr><tr><th>Armor Class:</th><td>2</td></tr><tr><th>Movement:</th><td>12 (or as guarded object moves)</td></tr><tr><th>Hit Dice:</th><td>4+4</td></tr><tr><th>THAC0:</th><td>15</td></tr><tr><th>No. of Attacks:</th><td>1</td></tr><tr><th>Damage/Attack:</th><td>1d4</td></tr><tr><th>Special Attacks:</th><td>Fireburst</td></tr><tr><th>Special Defenses:</th><td>Spell immunities, healed by fire</td></tr><tr><th>Magic Resistance:</th><td>Nil</td></tr><tr><th>Size:</th><td>T (1-2' tall)</td></tr><tr><th>Morale:</th><td>Fearless (20) when bound<br>Elite (13-14) when free</td></tr><tr><th>XP Value:</th><td>3,000</td></tr></table><p class=\"f\">The tome guardian (sometimes mistakenly heard and passed on as &ldquo;tomb guardian&rdquo;) is a creature of the Elemental Plane of Fire. Its nature and activities there are unknown, but it can be summoned to the Prime Material plane by magical means to serve as a guardian.</p><p>The tome guardian is typically bound to a magical tome (thus its name), but can also be found guarding another object instead. An object with a tome guardian can be protected by symbol or glyph as well. There are rare reports of two or more tome guardians being bound to the same item, but such reports have not been confirmed by reliable sources.</p><p>Tome guardians have never been known to attempt communication with living beings, but can apparently hear and understand Common (and perhaps other languages).</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Combat:</b> An object protected by a tome guardian typically shows no sign of being inhabited, except that it radiates a faint dweomer and a small amount of heat. The tome guardian shows its presence only when its object is touched, or when the object or the guardian itself is attacked. A tome guardian always uses this attack against a <a href=\"/appendix/bookworm\">bookworm</a> or any other creature attempting to consume or strike the object it is guarding. It never attacks a master for whom it guards an item.</p><p>The tome guardian's preferred method of attack, which it can use only three times per day, is a <i>fireburst</i>, a pencil-thin, white-hot flame; though the tome guardian can use the attack only three times per day, it cannot miss its target. Only one <i>fireburst</i> per round can be released by a single tome guardian, and it can affect only one target per release. The <i>fireburst</i> can operate through clothing or armor, or even through weapons; thus, it can be used without fail against any creature that touches or physically attacks the tome guardian or its protected object. The <i>fireburst</i> can also be passed through a mental attack or attempt at mental communication of any kind, whether from spell, item, or natural ability, to the individual that launched the mental attack or communication.</p><p>The <i>fireburst</i> deals 6d4 points of internal damage (no saving throw) to any creature not immune to the effects of heat or fire. Human, demihuman, and humanoid beings who survive a <i>fireburst</i> attack are rendered unconscious for 1d4+1 turns unless they make a successful saving throw vs. poison, with a -3 to the roll, due to the shock of their blood boiling momentarily in the area affected by the <i>fireburst</i>.</p><p>The <i>fireburst</i> does not generate any incidental heat or flame that might damage surrounding creatures or objects (such as the item being guarded). If two or more creatures laid hands on a guarded object simultaneously, and the guardian generated a <i>fireburst</i> in one of them, the other(s) would not be affected or even feel it.</p><p>If the tome guardian or its object is attacked or touched, and the tome guardian is unable to launch a <i>fireburst</i>, it can attack normally by swiping a fiery tendril at an opponent. The attack causes only 1d4 points of damage, but sets fire to flammable materials that fail a saving throw vs. magical fire. The tome guardian saves this attack for a last resort, because of its comparative weakness.</p><p>A tome guardian can absorb fiery or electrical energy impinging upon it (when it guards an object, it envelops it, and thus absorbs all fire directed at the object), whether of natural or magical (<i>fireball</i> or <i>lightning bolt</i>) origin. It gains a number of hit points equal to the number of points of damage the fire(s) or shock(s) would deal to an unprotected creature; this replenishes any damage it has suffered and then increases the creature's own hit points temporarily (for the following 24 hours). During this time, the tome guardian can add any or all of this additional energy directly to the damage dealt by any <i>fireburst</i> attack(s) it makes. Heat energy, such as that caused by the <i>heat metal</i> spell, the guardian merely absorbs.</p><p>A tome guardian is immune to the attacks of, but cannot itself harm, a <a href=\"/appendix/element2\">fire elemental</a>, <a href=\"/appendix/elekfire\">salamander</a>, <a href=\"/appendix/willowis\">will-o-wisp</a>, and <a href=\"/appendix/xagya\">xag-ya</a>. The tome guardian can also absorb and redirect any appropriate energies from these creatures' attacks. On rare occasions, tome guardians have been known to cooperate with such creatures for mutual survival and protection.</p><p>Cold inflicts double damage on the tome guardian; water-based attacks, it should be noted, do not. All physical attacks upon the object guarded do not harm the object until the guardian is destroyed, because it gathers its form into a rigid shell to ward off blows; however, because of this, all such attacks inflict the maximum possible damage upon the guardian. When a guardian is in free form, physical attacks inflict normal damage.</p><p>Tome guardians can be affected by most spells normally, but are aided by fire, electrical, and heat attacks, and unaffected by enchantment/charm magic such as <i>maze</i>, <i>sleep</i>, and <i>suggestion</i> (although <i>geas</i> is an exception). Door spells (such as <i>phase door</i> or <i>dimension door</i>) do not affect guardians, and are viewed as attacks. Tome guardians cannot be psionically dominated, and anyone attempting <i>ESP</i> or similar mind-meeting magic, by spell, item, or natural ability, finds that attempts to attack, control, or change a guardian cause it to attack (and, as mentioned, that it can employ its <i>fireburst</i> attack through such a mental link).</p><p>A tome guardian can be &ldquo;driven out&rdquo; of the object it is guarding by the casting of a <i>dispel magic</i> (the guardian receives a saving throw vs. spell; if the saving throw is successful, the creature is unaffected). Even the individual who bound the guardian to the object can dismiss it only in this way. The guardian is seen leaving the object, even in darkness.</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Habitat/Society:</b> Little is known of the tome guardian's life on the Elemental Plane of Fire, but interactions observed on the Prime Material Plane indicate that they are on reasonably good terms with most other creatures of flame. Only fire elementals that meet the parameters discussed here are summoned as tome guardians, so it is unknown if they have a weaker form (such as the lesser elemental summoned by a <i>Daltim's fiery protector</i> spell) or develop into something else later.</p><p>A mage summons the tome guardian by casting an <i>ensnarement</i> (sending or demand can work if the guardian's name is known; they do have personal names), and compels it to service by the use of a <i>binding</i> spell. The object to be guarded must be visible to the mage, who indicates it (by pointing and speaking) to the guardian. Tome guardians do not mind protecting an object, for unknown reasons of their own, and unless otherwise attacked are not hostile.</p><p>The guardian envelops, and appears to merge with, the object it has been bound to, becoming invisible. The object radiates a faint dweomer, and <i>infravision</i> detects the presence of the guardian - but the creature cannot be telepathically contacted or in any way coerced, tricked, or forced to leave its object except as described previously (through the use of a <i>dispel magic</i>). A guardian can guard only one physical object - and if the object is composed of readily separable parts, only one part (for example, a sword or its scabbard, not both). The guarded object must be small (of less than four cubic feet volume), and nonliving. Usually magical tomes of lore are so guarded, hence the guardian's name.</p><p>An individual can summon only one tome guardian per 24 hours. Normally, only one guardian can be bound to any object, though unsubstantiated reports suggest the presence of one or more within a single item is possible. If so, the method for binding more than one tome guardian to a single object is a generally unknown process, available only through the most obscure of arcane lore.</p><p>Guardians that are summoned to the Prime Material Plane but not successfully bound to an object, or who have been driven forth from the object they were guarding, assume what is known as their &ldquo;free form&rdquo;, and remain on the Prime Material Plane for 2d20 turns before &ldquo;dwindling away&rdquo;, returning to their own plane by natural means. They are not under any being's control during this time, and attack any creature who attacks (or attempts to control) them. Otherwise, they are attracted to large fires, of natural origin (such as volcanoes and forest fire) or manmade (like bonfires, forges, or even isolated campfires).</p><p>A tome guardian can be bound to a magical item, serving as a protector, or perhaps even being trained to release a <i>fireburst</i> if its guarded item is used in an attack (for example, if a tome guardian is bound to a sword, then that sword could be used to deliver three <i>firebursts</i> per day, in addition to any other powers it has). If attached to a magical item that produces flame or electricity (such as a <i>ring of shocking grasp</i>), the tome guardian absorbs such energies and prevents their function. However, at the DM's discretion, such energies might be used to enhance the tome guardian's <i>fireburst</i> ability.</p><p>Symbols and glyphs cast upon a guarded object do not affect the guardian and function normally against others. Note that fiery or electrical protective spells such as <i>explosive runes</i> and <i>fire trap</i> can be cast upon a tome guarded by a guardian, but the creature absorbs the spell energy as it is being cast, so that the spell's protection does not exist (and the guardian gains, for a day, hit points equal to the maximum damage these spells would have dealt).</p><p>Tome guardians can coexist peacefully with <a href=\"/appendix/yugoguar\">guardian yugoloths</a>, guardian familiars, <a href=\"/appendix/homuncul\">homunculi</a>, and the like, as well as with other creatures of elemental fire. If a guardian is brought into the presence of a <a href=\"/appendix/xagya\">xeg-yi</a>, they attack each other at once. Otherwise, the tome guardian is peaceful and solitary, at least on the Prime Material Plane.</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Ecology:</b> Ecology: Tome guardians might collect treasures on their home plane, but on the Prime Material Plane, a tome guardian is never found with more treasure than the item it guards and whatever might be lying nearby. They collect nothing, and they do not pursue prey of any kind. Sages who know about these creatures generally agree that they must feed on warmth, fire, and perhaps even light, and that they may even take nourishment from the heat of bodies they cause to burn.</p><p>If killed, a tome guardian's essence dissipates in a wave of heat and a dusting of ash. The ash has proven a viable ingredient for <i>oil of fiery burning</i> and <i>smoke powder</i>, and would presumably serve well in other fire-related potions or magical items. The heat released by the death of a tome guardian has been suggested as a means to temper a <i>ring of fire resistance</i>. The creature's <i>fireburst</i> might also be useful in igniting the flame powers of certain items, like a <i>flame tongue sword</i>; however, touching an item to the tome guardian in hopes of this is a dangerous proposition, because the <i>fireburst</i> attack still affects the wielder of the item.</p><p>It is also possible, as hinted at before, to bind a tome guardian to an item specifically to make that item magical. In fact, a small number of <i>fireburst daggers</i>, daggers with bound tome guardians, are known to exist. For the first three attacks each day with such an item, roll an attack roll against AC 10, adjusted only by Dexterity and any magical bonuses. If the attack is successful, the tome guardian propels a <i>fireburst</i> into the victim. The <i>fireburst</i> is not used if the item does not hit. Once the item has hit three times, it cannot use <i>fireburst</i> again until the next day, but it can still be used as a normal item of its type.</p>\n","images":["<img src=\"grf/fr.gif\" width=\"150\" height=\"75\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Forgotten Realms\" title=\"Forgotten Realms\" align=\"right\">","<img src=\"img/elekftgu.gif\" alt=\"Elemental, Fire Kin, Tome Guardian\" title=\"Elemental, Fire Kin, Tome Guardian\" border=\"0\" width=\"300\" height=\"360\" style=\"text-align:right;\" align=\"right\">","<img src=\"grf/add2_01.gif\" width=\"200\" height=\"56\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Advanced Dungeons & Dragons 2nd Edition\">"],"setting":"Forgotten Realms","statblock":{"Elemental, Fire Kin, Tome Guardian":{"Activity Cycle":"Any","Alignment":"Neutral","Armor Class":"2","Climate/Terrain":"Any","Damage/Attack":"1d4","Diet":"Fire, electricity, and heat","Frequency":"Very rare","Hit Dice":"4+4","Intelligence":"Average (8-10)","Magic Resistance":"Nil","Morale":"Fearless (20) when bound<br>Elite (13-14) when free","Movement":"12 (or as guarded object moves)","No. Appearing":"1","No. of Attacks":"1","Organization":"Solitary","Size":"T (1-2' tall)","Special Attacks":"Fireburst","Special Defenses":"Spell immunities, healed by fire","THAC0":"15","Treasure":"One guarded object","XP Value":"3,000"}},"title":"Elemental, Fire Kin, Tome Guardian"},"sources":["2166","9491"],"statblock_names":[],"title":"Elemental, Fire Kin, Tome Guardian","prev_key":"elekfsal","next_key":"elekwate","monster_path":"/appendix/elekftgu"}},"staticQueryHashes":[],"slicesMap":{}}
