While the powers listed above are the most common, some aarakocra have different or additional powers.</p><p class=\"f\">A race of intelligent, birdlike creatures living in the deepest deserts of Athas, the rare Athasian <a href=\"/appendix/aarakocr\">aarakocra</a> spends its time soaring on thermals in search of food.</p><p>The aarakocra is 7 to 8 feet tall with a wingspan of 20 feet or more. Because of its large wingspan, an aarakocra can carry as much as 75% of its own body weight and still fly easily. An aarakocra can fly a short distance carrying a burden equaling 125% of its own body weight. The average body weight of a full grown male is 100 pounds and a female is 85 pounds.</p><p>Each wing has a &ldquo;hand&rdquo; at its midpoint, consisting of three fingers and an opposable thumb. The fourth finger forms the rigid leading edge of the wing. In flight the hands cannot be used, but on the ground the aarakocra can use its hands almost as a human would. The aarakocra's body is protected by a thin bony plate on the chest, much like a solid rib cage. Talons on its legs can be used as claws and can be retracted to reveal a second set of hands, also with three fingers and an opposable thumb. Except for the chest plate, the entire skeleton is hollow and extremely fragile.</p><p>From a distance, the Athasian aarakocra resembles a huge <a href=\"/appendix/bird\">vulture</a>. Its black eyes, set in the front of the head, provide excellent vision over a long range. The plumage is generally black with a white collar for adult males and black or brown with a smaller white collar for females. Adolescents are a mixture of brown and black. The beak is large and covers most of the head. Plumage begins at the crown of the head and is darker near the head, except for the collar. Athasian aarakocra speak their own language and the languages of vultures and other large birds. Some speak the common tongue (5% to 10% chance depending on how deep in the wastelands a tribe lives).</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Combat:</b> Aarakocra can fight in the air or on the ground. They prefer aerial combat since their bones are too fragile to withstand a solid blow from a human-sized opponent. In combat against creatures on the ground, they prefer to fly over their victim and drop weighted nets. Some aarakocra use darts to harass ground-based opponents.</p><p>If their opponents can fly, the aarakocra generally forgo the use of the net, although large groups sometimes use nets on flying creatures. Normally, aarakocra attack flying creatures with long spears, diving from above and allowing the momentum to carry the spear through the target. Such an attack doubles the damage if the aarakocra have been able to dive at least 50 feet. Only the very largest aarakocra can carry more than one of these spears, they can attack with both at once with no penalty, causing double damage on each strike. All diving attacks are made at +4 and should be treated as a charge attack. All other penalties and restrictions of charge attacks apply.</p><p>The effect of the aarakocra's nets depends on if the opponent is flying at the time it becomes entangled. Creatures on the ground that are hit by a net are entangled and unable to participate in any combat until they make a successful Strength check to get free of the net. Flying creatures hit by a net can no longer fly and immediately begin falling. If they cannot escape the net or use some magical means to arrest the fall, normal falling damage applies.</p><p>Unless victims are entangled in nets, aarakocra are cautious in ground combat. If the aarakocra outnumber their opponents they advance in a straight line and thrust with their spears. If outnumbered, or the opponents are particularly tough, the aarakocra withdraw. Victims entangled in nets are killed or incapacitated for use as food or ransom.</p><p>Athasian aarakocra are mindful of their physical limitations as well as their comparatively low psionic abilities. They do not normally initiate psionic combat. At the first sign of psionic powers from any of their victims, however, all aarakocra that have some ability will use whatever attack and defense modes they can in an attempt to destroy the threat. Large groups of is or more aarakocra may initiate psionic combat if their leaders feel they can win quickly and avoid physical combat.</p><p>In desperation, an aarakocra can attempt to bite an opponent in combat. Because of the unwieldiness of its beak, the aarakocra has a THAC0 of 18 if attacking with this appendage. Further, the birdman causes only 1d2 points of damage with the beak.</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Habitat/Society:</b> Athasian aarakocra live in tribes with 6-20 (2d8+4) members, depending on the prestige of the leader. The largest tribe ever recorded had 50 members. The tribal hunting territory depends on the size of the tribe, usually about 500 square miles for a tribe of 10 members. There are no rigid boundaries between tribes and border disputes are not uncommon.</p><p>Alignments of tribe members are similar to the alignment of the leader. A tribe that has a leader who is neutral good may have neutral good, chaotic good, lawful good, and true neutral members. A predominantly evil tribe does not recognize boundaries with other tribes and treats other tribes as inferior beings to be eliminated.</p><p>Athasian aarakocra aren't happy in enclosed spaces, but they they take refuge in a cave or building if necessary.</p><p>Nonevil tribes live in rocky aeries in the highest peaks they can find. Evil tribes are normally nomadic and use an aerie made by another tribe if they need to remain in an area for a long time, even if they have to evict the tribe that made the nest.</p><p>Aarakocra aren't friendly toward intruders in their territory, especially caravans. They try to extract a toll from the caravan for passage through the desert. Good-aligned tribes allow unhindered passage of caravans that pay a tribute. If someone refuses to pay the tribute, the aarakocra try to capture scouts or outriders from the party and hold them until an even larger tribute is paid. The payment may be either livestock or shiny objects. Aarakocra are smart enough not to be taken in by glass baubles instead of gems, although they cannot tell the difference between the more common gems and the rare ones.</p><p>Evil tribes ask for tribute and often attack a caravan whether it pays or not. Aarakocra always demand shiny objects such as stones. These tribes find humans and demihumans to be quite tasty and prefer them to other food.</p><p>Good-aligned tribes of aarakocra sometimes return a lost traveler to the edge of the desert after first removing any valuables the traveler may be carrying. On very rare occasions a tribe might return a lost group of travelers to the more frequently traveled parts of the desert, again after first taking any valuables as payment.</p><p>The oldest male is the leader of the tribal hunting party and has 4+4 Hit Dice. The oldest female is in charge of the tribal aerie and has 3+3 HD. In tribes that have more than 15 members, the next oldest aarakocra serves as shaman and has 3+3 HD; the shaman completes the triumvirate necessary for proper worship and the summoning of elementals. (Interestingly, no magic-using aarakocra has ever been recorded.) Tribes without a shaman cannot summon <a href=\"/appendix/element1\">air elementals</a>, which is an important part of aarakocra culture.</p><p>The shaman is the leader of the daily sun worship. Aarakocra worship the sun because it provides them with the thermals they need to soar in search of food. The shaman also leads the mystic rituals used to summon an air elemental. Summoning an air elemental is usually done only in preparation for the tribe's most sacred ceremony, the hunt. Small tribes must band together for this ceremony to allow the triumvirate to be formed.</p><p>The ceremony to summon an air elemental must be conducted at dawn and requires the oldest male and female to emit a highpitched keening whistle. The shaman conducts an intricate dance around them, simultaneously chanting an ancient summoning mantra.</p><p>The hunt is the final part of the initiation of adolescent aarakocra to adulthood and often takes the tribe far from their normal teritory. The target is always a <a href=\"/appendix/drakalsi\">silt drake</a>. The hunt is the only time the females leave the relative safety of the nest. Even an evil tribe will not interfere with a tribe on a hunt. An air elemental is often summoned to help find the drake, but never takes part in the actual combat. Although the adult members of the tribe take part in the initial phases of the combat, it is the initiates who deliver the final, killing blows to me drake. Scars from the hunt are considered a mark of pride among all aarakocra.</p><p>The females spend about eight months of the year incubating their eggs. Athasian aarakocra mate for life and a pair normally produces as many as 10 offspring. A female lays one egg a year. Constant incubation is not required because of the high daytime temperatures, so the females can maintain the nest and keep the tribe's treasure in order.</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Ecology:</b> Athasian aarakocra are high on the food chain and have no natural enemies other than <a href=\"/appendix/drakatha\">drakes</a>. Unless evil, aarakocra leave their own territory only to hunt the silt drake and return as soon as possible when the hunt is over. (Evil aarakocra attack others, as noted above.) Aarakocra eggs and hatchlings are sought after by wealthy land owners who wish to use the creatures as scouts and sentries. An egg can bring as much as 10 cp in Tyr's marketplace. Tribes that have had eggs or hatchlings stolen have long memories and sometimes take revenge against the thief at a later date. Captive aarakocra join any tribe they come in contact with.</p><p>Athasian aarakocra have a natural life span of 21-30 years.</p><br clear=\"all\" style=\"clear:both; height:0;\">\r\n","images":["<img src=\"grf/ds.gif\" width=\"150\" height=\"75\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Dark Sun\" title=\"Dark Sun\" align=\"right\">","<img src=\"img/aarakath.gif\" alt=\"Aarakocra (Athas)\" title=\"Aarakocra (Athas)\" border=\"0\" width=\"300\" height=\"360\" style=\"text-align:right;\" align=\"right\">","<img src=\"grf/add2_01.gif\" width=\"200\" height=\"56\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Advanced Dungeons & Dragons 2nd Edition\">"],"setting":"Dark Sun","statblock":{"Aarakocra (Athas)":{"Activity Cycle":"Day","Alignment":"Any","Armor Class":"7","Climate/Terrain":"Deep desert","Damage/Attack":"1d3/1d3 or by weapon","Diet":"Carnivore","Frequency":"Rare","Hit Dice":"2+2","Intelligence":"Average (8-10)","Magic Resistance":"Nil","Morale":"Steady (11)","Movement":"6, Fl 36 (C)","No. Appearing":"1d10","No. of Attacks":"2","Organization":"Tribal","Size":"M (20'+ wingspan)","Special Attacks":"Nil","Special Defenses":"Nil","THAC0":"17","Treasure":"Varies","XP Value":"65"}},"title":"Aarakocra (Athas)"},"sources":["2433"],"statblock_names":[],"title":"Aarakocra (Athas)","prev_key":"zygraat","next_key":"aarakocr","monster_path":"/appendix/aarakath"}}},"pageContext":{"monster_key":"shivak","monster_data":{"TSR":["1065"],"fullBody":"  <table cellspacing=\"0\" cellpadding=\"0\"><tr class=\"bk\"><th> </th><th class=\"cn\">Common</th><th class=\"cn\">Guardian</th></tr><tr><th>Climate/Terrain:</th><td><i>Spelljammer</i></td><td>Control room</td></tr><tr><th>Frequency:</th><td>Common</td><td>Unique</td></tr><tr><th>Organization:</th><td>Squad</td><td>Solitary</td></tr><tr><th>Activity Cycle:</th><td>Continuous</td><td>Continuous</td></tr><tr><th>Diet:</th><td>None</td><td>None</td></tr><tr><th>Intelligence:</th><td>High (13-14)</td><td>Genius (17-18)</td></tr><tr><th>Treasure:</th><td>Nil</td><td>Nil</td></tr><tr><th>Alignment:</th><td>Neutral</td><td>Neutral</td></tr><tr><th>No. Appearing:</th><td>1 or 1-8</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><th>Armor Class:</th><td>3</td><td>-3</td></tr><tr><th>Movement:</th><td>12</td><td>12</td></tr><tr><th>Hit Dice:</th><td>5</td><td>20</td></tr><tr><th>THAC0:</th><td>16</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><th>No. of Attacks:</th><td>2</td><td>2</td></tr><tr><th>Damage/Attack:</th><td>1-8</td><td>3-18</td></tr><tr><th>Special Attacks:</th><td>See below</td><td>See below</td></tr><tr><th>Special Defenses:</th><td>See below</td><td>See below</td></tr><tr><th>Magic Resistance:</th><td>40%</td><td>60%</td></tr><tr><th>Size:</th><td>S or M (3-5')</td><td>L (10' high)</td></tr><tr><th>Morale:</th><td>Fanatic (17-18)</td><td>Fearless (19-20)</td></tr><tr><th>XP Value:</th><td>5,000</td><td>23,000</td></tr></table><p class=\"f\">The shivaks are only found aboard the <i>Spelljammer</i>, and they are constructed (grown) in a manner similar to the smalljammers. In the shivaks' case, they are constructed in the shivak terminal (Area #15) rather than In the gardens (Area #2) llke the smalljammers. The shivak grow in pods out of the lifeless corridors.</p><p>When shivaks are destroyed or wear out, more are constructed. Those that are not immediatly needed are kept in storage, where they are maintained on small amounts of energy from the shlp. There are about 500 shivaks on board the ship at any one time.</p><p>Shivaks resemble headless ellipsoids that have limbs. The limbs are arranged in such a manner that varieties of shivaks resemble various races aboard the ship.</p><p>The surface of a shivak appears to be covered by a thick gray leather. However, this leatherlike exterior extends fully to the core of a shivak - in other words, shivaks lack organs in the known sense. The limbs are made of similar material, and they are what allow the shivaks to maneuver. (Shivaks move forward, backward, and sideways at will, much as if they were on rollers.)</p><p>Each variety of shivak also has a special attack form that it may use at will as described below.</p><p>The types of common shivak include the followlng:</p><ul><li><i>Humanoid</i> - This shivak has humanoid limbs that consist of two stumplike legs and two multlhinged arms, each arm ending in a delicate bundle of tapered coils. The coils allow the humanoid shivak to perform delicate work, but the humanoid's chief attribute is incredible strength. At will, they may raise their strength to that of <a href=\"/appendix/gianfire\">fire giant</a> level, gaining +4 to hit and + 10 to damage.</li><li><i>Centaurian</i> - The <a href=\"/appendix/centaur\">centaurian</a> shivaks ellptical body is horizontal rather then upright. It is supportad by four horse-like limbs, and it has a set of multijointed humanoid arms mounted at what is presumed to be the forward end of the shivak. The centaurian's chief attribute is speed, and it can increase its movement to 24 at will.</li><li><i>Beholdarian</i> - The beholderian shivak is a floating egg-shape that has a bundle of tentacles nestled around its crown. It does not have the eyes of a <a href=\"/appendix/beholde1\">beholder</a>, but its coils are incredibly strong (STR = 19). More importantly, this shivak can fly at its normal movement speed, and it has an MC of A.</li><li><i>Serpentine</i> - The <a href=\"/appendix/snake\">serpentine</a> shivak Is a narrow ellipsoid that has an extended tail, which the shivak uses to coil arround its opponents. It constricts its target, then crawls off with the creature still in its coils. The serpentine shivak has the ability to compress its body as well, allowing it to squeeze into spaces no more than 1 foot across in pursuit of its opponent.</li><li><i>Spiderian</i> - Also catled <a href=\"/appendix/neogi\">neogian</a>, this shivak is a horizontal ellipsoid much like the centaurian's body. This shivak's body, however, is supported by eight movable legs and is slung upward like a <a href=\"/appendix/spider\">spider</a>. Spiderian shivaks have the ability to spit a paralyzing poison up to 20 feet away, This poison can freeze an opponent for 1-3 rounds - enough time for the spiderian (and the other shivaks as well) to overwhelm and remove the intruder.</li><li>Enigmatic - The enigmatlc shivak is a mystery because it does not resemble any of the currently known major races of space. This shivak has a triform body, with three stump-like limbs and three arms coiled like rope and ending in trilateral &ldquo;hands&rdquo;. While it resembles both the <a href=\"/appendix/xorn\">xorn</a> and the <a href=\"/appendix/tripheg\">triphegs</a>, neither of those races have been known to have had a major impact in space outside their home worlds. The enigmatic shivak has a nasty ability in that it may produce a shocking grasp (as per the spell) for 2-12 points of additional damage when grappling with an opponent. This is only used to shock its opponents into submission.</li></ul><p class=\"f\"><b>Combat:</b> <img src=\"/img/spc/shivak2.gif\" width=\"300\" height=\"360\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Shivak\" title=\"Shivak\" style=\"float:left;\">The shivaks in battle fight as a unified whole, regardless of their appearance. Their tactics are generally straightforward, consisting of overwhelming their opponents with numbers, then carting them off. Their main function seems to be to keep trespassers out of areas of the Spelljammer that are off limits.</p><p>The shivaks are apparently connected to both the ship and to each other, for attacking one shivak typically brings others in quick succession (usually 1-8 additional shivaks will appear 3-6 rounds after the initial attack).</p><p>The shivaks have been given only limited orders, however, and they will only attack if they are attacked, if a creature is in a restricted area, or if they are prevented from doing their normal tasks, which include food delivery and dismantling ships. Otherwise they tend to leave the other races on board alone and are in turn left alone by other races.</p><p>The shivaks are immune to illusion and light-based attacks. They cannot be poisoned, <i>polymorphed</i>, or paralyzed, nor may they be <i>charmed</i> or otherwise affected by enchantment spells, including <i>sleep</i>. They are immune to their own attack forms, including those of other shivaks.</p><p>The shivaks do not see in the traditional sense, but rather they emanate a continuai <i>detect life</i>. Otherwise invisible living creatures stand out brightly to them, as do those masked by illusion spells. They know the buildings and warrens of the ship by heart and can move smoothly around inanimate objects. However, animate, unliving creatures (such as undead, <a href=\"/appendix/golem\">golems</a>, and <a href=\"/appendix/clwohorr\">clockwork horrors</a>) are invisible to them. They cannot attack what they cannot see, though they may flail around at -4 to hit.</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Habitat/Society:</b> The shivaks have no real society and are little more than extensions of the wlll of the Spelljammer itself. Unless specifically commanded otherwise by the captain, they will continue to perform their normal duties.</p><p>When under the control of the captain, they will respond to his or her orders as long as those orders do not directly contradict the shivaks' functions. (For instance, the captain cannot order the shivaks to not attack a trespasser found in the warrens.)</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Ecology:</b> The shivaks are &ldquo;grown&rdquo; in the shivak terminal, far from the light of the gardens, in great pods hanging from the wall. Unlike the smalljammers, the shivaks' only requirement for development is the presence of a spelljamming helm, whlch will create 1-10 new shlvaks. Any spelljammlng helms that are found will be taken back to the terminal for future use.</p><p>It takes only a few days for the terminal to create these shivaks once it has a new helm. The process is simllar to the creation of the smalljammers upon the arrival of a new captain. The spelljamming helms, however, are consumed in the process and cannot be regained.</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Guardlan Shivak</b></p>  <p class=\"ni\">The guardian shivak is the largest of the shivaks and is found only in the control room. (The control room is an area that appears on the Spelljammer only when a prospective captain comes on board; the area randomly shifts position throughout the ship and is seldom found in the same place twice in a row. The adventurer must defeat the guardian shivak to bond with the ship and become captain.)</p><p>The guardian shivak is built to encompass the worst fears of the previous captain. As such, it strongly resembles the physical form those fears take (as opposed to the elliptical shape of the other shivaks). The current guardian shivak resembles a gigantic <a href=\"/appendix/mindflay\">mind flayer</a>. It Is equipped with a psionic blast similar to that of a mind flayer.</p><p>The guardian shivak is made of the same leathery material as are the common shivak, however, and it too has no apparent internal organs. The guardian has all the resistances and immunities of the other shivaks.</p><p>The guardian shivak exists only when an ultimate helm is carried on board the <i>Spelljammer</i>. This shivak is developed specifically for the purpose of challenging the possessor of the helm.</p><p>If the helm is destroyed or carried off the ship, the guardian shivak is absorbed back into the ship itself. It will reform each time an ultimate helm is present, and It will continue to be in the form that encompasses the fears of the previous captain, regardless of how many times the guardian shivak is called upon to appear.</p><p></p><br clear=\"all\" style=\"clear:both; height:0;\">\r\n","images":["<img src=\"grf/sj.gif\" width=\"150\" height=\"75\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Spelljammer\" title=\"Spelljammer\" align=\"right\">","<img src=\"img/shivak.gif\" alt=\"Shivak\" title=\"Shivak\" border=\"0\" width=\"300\" height=\"360\" style=\"text-align:right;\" align=\"right\">","<img src=\"/img/spc/shivak2.gif\" width=\"300\" height=\"360\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Shivak\" title=\"Shivak\" style=\"float:left;\">","<img src=\"grf/add2_01.gif\" width=\"200\" height=\"56\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Advanced Dungeons & Dragons 2nd Edition\">"],"setting":"Spelljammer","statblock":{"Common":{"Activity Cycle":"Continuous","Alignment":"Neutral","Armor Class":"3","Climate/Terrain":"<i>Spelljammer</i>","Damage/Attack":"1-8","Diet":"None","Frequency":"Common","Hit Dice":"5","Intelligence":"High (13-14)","Magic Resistance":"40%","Morale":"Fanatic (17-18)","Movement":"12","No. Appearing":"1 or 1-8","No. of Attacks":"2","Organization":"Squad","Size":"S or M (3-5')","Special Attacks":"See below","Special Defenses":"See below","THAC0":"16","Treasure":"Nil","XP Value":"5,000"},"Guardian":{"Activity Cycle":"Continuous","Alignment":"Neutral","Armor Class":"-3","Climate/Terrain":"Control room","Damage/Attack":"3-18","Diet":"None","Frequency":"Unique","Hit Dice":"20","Intelligence":"Genius (17-18)","Magic Resistance":"60%","Morale":"Fearless (19-20)","Movement":"12","No. Appearing":"1","No. of Attacks":"2","Organization":"Solitary","Size":"L (10' high)","Special Attacks":"See below","Special Defenses":"See below","THAC0":"1","Treasure":"Nil","XP Value":"23,000"}},"title":"Shivak"},"sources":["1065"],"statblock_names":[],"title":"Shivak","prev_key":"shirokin","next_key":"shocker","monster_path":"/appendix/shivak"}},"staticQueryHashes":[],"slicesMap":{}}
