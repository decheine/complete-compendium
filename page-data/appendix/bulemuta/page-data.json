However, in addition to its bite and front claw attacks, there is a 65% chance per round of combat with a foe that has actually caused it to lose hit points that the mutated monster will breathe a cone of fire 20' long, with a base diameter of 5', that does 3-18 hp damage (save vs. breath weapon for half damage). The creature has been given venom glands by Shivnar to enable it to breathe fire, and it can use this attack up to four times per day.</p><p>Like the normal bulette, the mutated variety has AC -2 around its heavily fortified head, AC 6 in the vulnerable area beneath its crest, and AC 4 in the tiny area of the orbits of its eyes. When injured or cornered, it may also jump up to 8', employing its rear feet in attacking. It doesn't employ its breath weapon in the same round that it jumps.</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Habitat/Society:</b> If this specimen escapes from Shivnar's lair, it may, at the DM's option, meet with others of its kind and produce offspring. In this unlikely event, half of any young will be normal bulettes, the other 50% will be identical to Shivnar's creation.</p><p>It conforms to normal bulettes with regard to territory and disposition.</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Ecology:</b> If the beast is released into Kilfay, it isn't long before large tracts of woodland are either undermined or destroyed by fire. In 1-3 weeks, if not slain, it moves into the area of Talvli to hunt the humans and their livestock, burning houses and toppling forts as it tunnels about the land. If slain, its armor may be fashioned into suitable shields as outlined <a href=\"/appendix/bulette\">here</a>.</p><br clear=\"all\" style=\"clear:both; height:0;\">\r\n","images":["<img src=\"grf/du.gif\" width=\"150\" height=\"75\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Dungeon Magazine\" title=\"Dungeon Magazine\" align=\"right\">","<img src=\"grf/add2_01.gif\" width=\"200\" height=\"56\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Advanced Dungeons & Dragons 2nd Edition\">"],"setting":"Dungeon Magazine","statblock":{"Bulette-Mutation, The":{"Activity Cycle":"Any","Alignment":"Neutral","Armor Class":"-2/4/6","Climate/Terrain":"Temperate/Any","Damage/Attack":"4d12/3d6/3d6","Diet":"Carnivore","Frequency":"Unique","Hit Dice":"10 (73 hit points)","Intelligence":"Animal (1)","Magic Resistance":"Nil","Morale":"Steady (11)","Movement":"14, Br 3","No. Appearing":"1","No. of Attacks":"3","Organization":"Solitary","Size":"L (9&#189;' tall, 12' long)","Special Attacks":"8' jump, breath weapon","Special Defenses":"Nil","THAC0":"11","Treasure":"Nil","XP Value":"5,000"}},"title":"Bulette-Mutation, The"},"sources":["Dungeon#37"],"statblock_names":[],"title":"Bulette-Mutation, The","prev_key":"bulegohl","next_key":"bulette"}},"staticQueryHashes":[],"slicesMap":{}}
