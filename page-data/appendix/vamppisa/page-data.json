While the powers listed above are the most common, some aarakocra have different or additional powers.</p><p class=\"f\">A race of intelligent, birdlike creatures living in the deepest deserts of Athas, the rare Athasian <a href=\"/appendix/aarakocr\">aarakocra</a> spends its time soaring on thermals in search of food.</p><p>The aarakocra is 7 to 8 feet tall with a wingspan of 20 feet or more. Because of its large wingspan, an aarakocra can carry as much as 75% of its own body weight and still fly easily. An aarakocra can fly a short distance carrying a burden equaling 125% of its own body weight. The average body weight of a full grown male is 100 pounds and a female is 85 pounds.</p><p>Each wing has a &ldquo;hand&rdquo; at its midpoint, consisting of three fingers and an opposable thumb. The fourth finger forms the rigid leading edge of the wing. In flight the hands cannot be used, but on the ground the aarakocra can use its hands almost as a human would. The aarakocra's body is protected by a thin bony plate on the chest, much like a solid rib cage. Talons on its legs can be used as claws and can be retracted to reveal a second set of hands, also with three fingers and an opposable thumb. Except for the chest plate, the entire skeleton is hollow and extremely fragile.</p><p>From a distance, the Athasian aarakocra resembles a huge <a href=\"/appendix/bird\">vulture</a>. Its black eyes, set in the front of the head, provide excellent vision over a long range. The plumage is generally black with a white collar for adult males and black or brown with a smaller white collar for females. Adolescents are a mixture of brown and black. The beak is large and covers most of the head. Plumage begins at the crown of the head and is darker near the head, except for the collar. Athasian aarakocra speak their own language and the languages of vultures and other large birds. Some speak the common tongue (5% to 10% chance depending on how deep in the wastelands a tribe lives).</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Combat:</b> Aarakocra can fight in the air or on the ground. They prefer aerial combat since their bones are too fragile to withstand a solid blow from a human-sized opponent. In combat against creatures on the ground, they prefer to fly over their victim and drop weighted nets. Some aarakocra use darts to harass ground-based opponents.</p><p>If their opponents can fly, the aarakocra generally forgo the use of the net, although large groups sometimes use nets on flying creatures. Normally, aarakocra attack flying creatures with long spears, diving from above and allowing the momentum to carry the spear through the target. Such an attack doubles the damage if the aarakocra have been able to dive at least 50 feet. Only the very largest aarakocra can carry more than one of these spears, they can attack with both at once with no penalty, causing double damage on each strike. All diving attacks are made at +4 and should be treated as a charge attack. All other penalties and restrictions of charge attacks apply.</p><p>The effect of the aarakocra's nets depends on if the opponent is flying at the time it becomes entangled. Creatures on the ground that are hit by a net are entangled and unable to participate in any combat until they make a successful Strength check to get free of the net. Flying creatures hit by a net can no longer fly and immediately begin falling. If they cannot escape the net or use some magical means to arrest the fall, normal falling damage applies.</p><p>Unless victims are entangled in nets, aarakocra are cautious in ground combat. If the aarakocra outnumber their opponents they advance in a straight line and thrust with their spears. If outnumbered, or the opponents are particularly tough, the aarakocra withdraw. Victims entangled in nets are killed or incapacitated for use as food or ransom.</p><p>Athasian aarakocra are mindful of their physical limitations as well as their comparatively low psionic abilities. They do not normally initiate psionic combat. At the first sign of psionic powers from any of their victims, however, all aarakocra that have some ability will use whatever attack and defense modes they can in an attempt to destroy the threat. Large groups of is or more aarakocra may initiate psionic combat if their leaders feel they can win quickly and avoid physical combat.</p><p>In desperation, an aarakocra can attempt to bite an opponent in combat. Because of the unwieldiness of its beak, the aarakocra has a THAC0 of 18 if attacking with this appendage. Further, the birdman causes only 1d2 points of damage with the beak.</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Habitat/Society:</b> Athasian aarakocra live in tribes with 6-20 (2d8+4) members, depending on the prestige of the leader. The largest tribe ever recorded had 50 members. The tribal hunting territory depends on the size of the tribe, usually about 500 square miles for a tribe of 10 members. There are no rigid boundaries between tribes and border disputes are not uncommon.</p><p>Alignments of tribe members are similar to the alignment of the leader. A tribe that has a leader who is neutral good may have neutral good, chaotic good, lawful good, and true neutral members. A predominantly evil tribe does not recognize boundaries with other tribes and treats other tribes as inferior beings to be eliminated.</p><p>Athasian aarakocra aren't happy in enclosed spaces, but they they take refuge in a cave or building if necessary.</p><p>Nonevil tribes live in rocky aeries in the highest peaks they can find. Evil tribes are normally nomadic and use an aerie made by another tribe if they need to remain in an area for a long time, even if they have to evict the tribe that made the nest.</p><p>Aarakocra aren't friendly toward intruders in their territory, especially caravans. They try to extract a toll from the caravan for passage through the desert. Good-aligned tribes allow unhindered passage of caravans that pay a tribute. If someone refuses to pay the tribute, the aarakocra try to capture scouts or outriders from the party and hold them until an even larger tribute is paid. The payment may be either livestock or shiny objects. Aarakocra are smart enough not to be taken in by glass baubles instead of gems, although they cannot tell the difference between the more common gems and the rare ones.</p><p>Evil tribes ask for tribute and often attack a caravan whether it pays or not. Aarakocra always demand shiny objects such as stones. These tribes find humans and demihumans to be quite tasty and prefer them to other food.</p><p>Good-aligned tribes of aarakocra sometimes return a lost traveler to the edge of the desert after first removing any valuables the traveler may be carrying. On very rare occasions a tribe might return a lost group of travelers to the more frequently traveled parts of the desert, again after first taking any valuables as payment.</p><p>The oldest male is the leader of the tribal hunting party and has 4+4 Hit Dice. The oldest female is in charge of the tribal aerie and has 3+3 HD. In tribes that have more than 15 members, the next oldest aarakocra serves as shaman and has 3+3 HD; the shaman completes the triumvirate necessary for proper worship and the summoning of elementals. (Interestingly, no magic-using aarakocra has ever been recorded.) Tribes without a shaman cannot summon <a href=\"/appendix/element1\">air elementals</a>, which is an important part of aarakocra culture.</p><p>The shaman is the leader of the daily sun worship. Aarakocra worship the sun because it provides them with the thermals they need to soar in search of food. The shaman also leads the mystic rituals used to summon an air elemental. Summoning an air elemental is usually done only in preparation for the tribe's most sacred ceremony, the hunt. Small tribes must band together for this ceremony to allow the triumvirate to be formed.</p><p>The ceremony to summon an air elemental must be conducted at dawn and requires the oldest male and female to emit a highpitched keening whistle. The shaman conducts an intricate dance around them, simultaneously chanting an ancient summoning mantra.</p><p>The hunt is the final part of the initiation of adolescent aarakocra to adulthood and often takes the tribe far from their normal teritory. The target is always a <a href=\"/appendix/drakalsi\">silt drake</a>. The hunt is the only time the females leave the relative safety of the nest. Even an evil tribe will not interfere with a tribe on a hunt. An air elemental is often summoned to help find the drake, but never takes part in the actual combat. Although the adult members of the tribe take part in the initial phases of the combat, it is the initiates who deliver the final, killing blows to me drake. Scars from the hunt are considered a mark of pride among all aarakocra.</p><p>The females spend about eight months of the year incubating their eggs. Athasian aarakocra mate for life and a pair normally produces as many as 10 offspring. A female lays one egg a year. Constant incubation is not required because of the high daytime temperatures, so the females can maintain the nest and keep the tribe's treasure in order.</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Ecology:</b> Athasian aarakocra are high on the food chain and have no natural enemies other than <a href=\"/appendix/drakatha\">drakes</a>. Unless evil, aarakocra leave their own territory only to hunt the silt drake and return as soon as possible when the hunt is over. (Evil aarakocra attack others, as noted above.) Aarakocra eggs and hatchlings are sought after by wealthy land owners who wish to use the creatures as scouts and sentries. An egg can bring as much as 10 cp in Tyr's marketplace. Tribes that have had eggs or hatchlings stolen have long memories and sometimes take revenge against the thief at a later date. Captive aarakocra join any tribe they come in contact with.</p><p>Athasian aarakocra have a natural life span of 21-30 years.</p><br clear=\"all\" style=\"clear:both; height:0;\">\r\n","images":["<img src=\"grf/ds.gif\" width=\"150\" height=\"75\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Dark Sun\" title=\"Dark Sun\" align=\"right\">","<img src=\"img/aarakath.gif\" alt=\"Aarakocra (Athas)\" title=\"Aarakocra (Athas)\" border=\"0\" width=\"300\" height=\"360\" style=\"text-align:right;\" align=\"right\">","<img src=\"grf/add2_01.gif\" width=\"200\" height=\"56\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Advanced Dungeons & Dragons 2nd Edition\">"],"setting":"Dark Sun","statblock":{"Aarakocra (Athas)":{"Activity Cycle":"Day","Alignment":"Any","Armor Class":"7","Climate/Terrain":"Deep desert","Damage/Attack":"1d3/1d3 or by weapon","Diet":"Carnivore","Frequency":"Rare","Hit Dice":"2+2","Intelligence":"Average (8-10)","Magic Resistance":"Nil","Morale":"Steady (11)","Movement":"6, Fl 36 (C)","No. Appearing":"1d10","No. of Attacks":"2","Organization":"Tribal","Size":"M (20'+ wingspan)","Special Attacks":"Nil","Special Defenses":"Nil","THAC0":"17","Treasure":"Varies","XP Value":"65"}},"title":"Aarakocra (Athas)"},"sources":["2433"],"statblock_names":[],"title":"Aarakocra (Athas)","prev_key":"zygraat","next_key":"aarakocr","monster_path":"/appendix/aarakath"}}},"pageContext":{"monster_key":"vamppisa","monster_data":{"TSR":["BookofSorrows"],"fullBody":"  <table cellspacing=\"0\" cellpadding=\"0\"><tr><th>Climate/Terrain:</th><td>Sri Raji (most commonly)</td></tr><tr><th>Frequency:</th><td>Very rare</td></tr><tr><th>Organization:</th><td>Solitary</td></tr><tr><th>Activity Cycle:</th><td>Night</td></tr><tr><th>Diet:</th><td>Special</td></tr><tr><th>Intelligence:</th><td>Very (11-12)</td></tr><tr><th>Treasure:</th><td>K,U (no gems)</td></tr><tr><th>Alignment:</th><td>Chaotic evil</td></tr><tr><th>No. Appearing:</th><td>1</td></tr><tr><th>Armor Class:</th><td>10 (See below)</td></tr><tr><th>Movement:</th><td>0 (See below)</td></tr><tr><th>Hit Dice:</th><td>N/A</td></tr><tr><th>THAC0:</th><td>N/A</td></tr><tr><th>No. of Attacks:</th><td>1</td></tr><tr><th>Damage/Attack:</th><td>Special</td></tr><tr><th>Special Attacks:</th><td>See below</td></tr><tr><th>Special Defenses:</th><td>Spell Immunity</td></tr><tr><th>Magic Resistance:</th><td>Nil (see below)</td></tr><tr><th>Size:</th><td>M (6' tall)</td></tr><tr><th>Morale:</th><td>Average (8-10)</td></tr><tr><th>XP Value:</th><td>420</td></tr></table><p class=\"f\">A pisacha is a dangerous, nearly undetectable <a href=\"/appendix/vampire\">vampire</a> that slowly drains away its victim's health without actually coming into contact with the victim. All pisachas are undead males whose bodies do not decompose after their interment. They are often mistaken for invisible <a href=\"/appendix/ghost\">ghosts</a>, but defenses normally employed to combat ghosts are ineffective against these killers.</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Combat:</b> A pisacha can attack any human, half-elf, or half-Vistani within five miles of its interred body. The target must be asleep, and usually the young are favored over their elders; the target may be either male or female. Once a pisacha has attacked a particular target, it will continue to attack that same target until the target dies or the attacks are deterred. A character who is protected from scrying and similar detection effects will not be selected as a target by the pisacha, but gaining such protection after being selected will not deter the pisacha or prevent subsequent attacks.</p><p>Once the pisacha has located a sleeping target, it begins to consume the victim's breath as he or she exhales. Anyone observing the target will see his or her chest rising and falling with each breath, but no flow of air can be discerned emerging from the victim's nose or mouth. After at least one hour of having his or her breath stolen, but only once each night, the victim must make a Constitution check. If the check is successful, the victim wakes the next morning feeling unusually weak and suffers a -2 Dexterity penalty for 2d4 hours. If the check is unsuccessful, the character awakes feeling cold and weak, suffers a -2 Dexterity penalty for 4d4 hours, cannot memorize or receive any spells without an additional six hours of rest, and permanently loses 1 point of Constitution. When a character's Constitution reaches 0, the character dies. Characters killed by a pisacha do not necessarily become vampires themselves. On a second or subsequent feeding, if the pisacha's victim is under the effects of <i>feign death</i> or a similar spell, if the victim is sleeping in a sealed (not necessarily air-tight) coffin, or if the victim sleeps with a ripened coriander fruit on his or her chest, then the vampire will pass over the target in favor of another. The following night, the pisacha will try again for its first target; if it is again deterred, it will settle on the second target as its victim thereafter. If there are no eligible targets sleeping within five miles of the pisacha's body, it goes without feeding but suffers no ill effects.</p><p>A pisacha typically resides in the coffin in which it was buried; it has no ability to move its own body. The body itself remains just as it did at death. If struck by a piercing weapon, the body will bleed in a steady flow that continues for 3d10 rounds. This blood is a mild poison that does 4d4 damage to anyone who comes in contact with it (or 2d4 to those who make a successful save vs. poison). If the pisacha's body is dismembered and its parts scattered, any one of these could continue to serve as its lair. The individual dismembering the body must make a Dexterity check during each round of such activity or come in contact with the poison. This roll may be modified if appropriate precautions are taken, but dismembering a corpse does require a powers check.</p><p>Once every three months a pisacha may transfer to a different lair, provided parts of its body have been appropriately separated. However, the pisacha cannot transfer in this fashion to a body part outside the domain it is in.</p><p>If all parts of the pisacha's body are burned to ashes then the vampire is destroyed. This fire must be natural, as pisachas are immune to magical fire. Additionally, pisachas are unaffected by <i>sleep</i>, <i>charm</i>, and <i>hold</i> spells, and they are immune to poison, paralysis, petrification, and death magic. They take no damage from damage-causing spells and magical effects. A pisacha whose body is splashed with at least two vials of holy water cannot feed for 2d4-1 days but is otherwise unaffected.</p><p>Only characters and creatures with the ability to speak with undead can communicate with a pisacha. They are likely to find the vampire intelligent and polite, and, though the pisacha will enjoy the rare opportunity for conversation, it will do whatever it can to protect itself, such as suggesting false means of destroying itself. A <i>raise dead</i> cast on a pisacha will not bring it back to life but it will restore the memories (but not the personality) of its former life. No one has yet reported the effect of casting <i>animate dead</i> on a pisacha's body.</p><p>The pisacha is undetectable at the site of the feeding, but <i>detect charm</i> and similar spells can determine that the victim is under some unnatural influence during the feeding. Detect undead will reveal the presence of an undead creature during the feeding, provided the pisacha fails its saving throw. The spell will also reveal the presence of the vampire if it is cast directly on the pisacha's body. During the feeding, the victim's body temperature becomes abnormally low. He or she lies generally still and cannot be awakened until the feeding is complete. As described above, the victim's exhalations produce no breath. The feeding can be disrupted by a priest who successfully turns the vampiric attack within one hour of its beginning. In this case, the pisacha is turned as a wraith, and the priest becomes the pisacha's next victim.</p><p>If the victim is killed while the vampire is feeding (within the first hour) in any way other than the vampire's Constitution drain, the pisacha ceases feeding and will be unable to feed again for 2d8+1 days. At the end of this period, there is an 80% chance the pisacha will select the killer as its next victim, provided the killer qualifies. This chance is decreased by 5% for every day beyond the seventh.</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Habitat/Society:</b> Pisachas form in one of two ways. Any male human, half-elf, or half-Vistani who dies and is buried in a coffin in Sri Raji transforms over the next 3d6 nights into a pisacha. The newly formed undead creature possesses no knowledge of its former life; it knows only its hunger. The pisacha's treasure consists of those items buried with it; it has no use for them and will be unconcerned if they are taken.</p><p>The second way for a pisacha to form is for a native of Sri Raji who is also a worshiper of Kali to die and be buried outside of Sri Raji. Native Sri Rajians typically burn their dead in great pyres (except those eaten by Arijani). Both types of pisacha possess the same characteristics and abilities.Generally, pisacha are formed from deceased adventurers who have traveled to Sri Raji from elsewhere in the demiplane or from outside the demiplane. Killed in Sri Raji, they were buried by their companions and left to become vampires. The natives of Sri Raji discourage foreigners from burying their dead there, but they do not prevent it.</p><p>In the unusual case that there are two pisachas within the same feeding area, neither will feed on the other's target, but otherwise they will not interact.</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Ecology:</b> Clearly, there is some connection between the creation of pisachas and Sri Raji itself; however, what that relationship might be is unclear. Arijani has recently taken notice of the few pisachas in his domain, but he has taken no action regarding them. So long as they don't present a substantial threat to his food supply, he sees no reason to interfere with them. No one is certain why only males become pisachas.</p><p>Because a pisacha's feedings kill the victim slowly over a couple of weeks, the victim is often thought to be suffering from some type of illness or disease, as there are no outward signs of injury. Pisachas usually select victims within some proximity to recently consumed ones, as doing so helps perpetuate the suspicions of contagion and makes it more difficult for others to locate their lairs.</p><p>Scholars have pointed out that it is easier to defeat a pisacha in Sri Raji than elsewhere because the scarcity of grave sites makes the pisacha's lair easy to find once it has been determined that that is the nature of the danger. On the other hand, most other domains (excluding Souragne) feature a large number of grave sites which could be lairs of pisachas, and the stones that mark these graves do not always reveal their true inhabitants. Of course, a pisacha's body could consist of as little as one of its teeth, and finding and destroying such a thing in any domain would be difficult.</p><p><br></p><p class=\"ni\">By Bil Boozer</p><br clear=\"all\" style=\"clear:both; height:0;\">\r\n","images":["<img src=\"grf/rv.gif\" width=\"150\" height=\"75\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Ravenloft\" title=\"Ravenloft\" align=\"right\">","<img src=\"grf/add2_01.gif\" width=\"200\" height=\"56\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Advanced Dungeons & Dragons 2nd Edition\">"],"setting":"Ravenloft","statblock":{"Vampire, Pisacha":{"Activity Cycle":"Night","Alignment":"Chaotic evil","Armor Class":"10 (See below)","Climate/Terrain":"Sri Raji (most commonly)","Damage/Attack":"Special","Diet":"Special","Frequency":"Very rare","Hit Dice":"N/A","Intelligence":"Very (11-12)","Magic Resistance":"Nil (see below)","Morale":"Average (8-10)","Movement":"0 (See below)","No. Appearing":"1","No. of Attacks":"1","Organization":"Solitary","Size":"M (6' tall)","Special Attacks":"See below","Special Defenses":"Spell Immunity","THAC0":"N/A","Treasure":"K,U (no gems)","XP Value":"420"}},"title":"Vampire, Pisacha"},"sources":["BookofSorrows"],"statblock_names":[],"title":"Vampire, Pisacha","prev_key":"vamporie","next_key":"vampvely","monster_path":"/appendix/vamppisa"}},"staticQueryHashes":[],"slicesMap":{}}
