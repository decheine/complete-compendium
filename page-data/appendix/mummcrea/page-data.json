While the powers listed above are the most common, some aarakocra have different or additional powers.</p><p class=\"f\">A race of intelligent, birdlike creatures living in the deepest deserts of Athas, the rare Athasian <a href=\"/appendix/aarakocr\">aarakocra</a> spends its time soaring on thermals in search of food.</p><p>The aarakocra is 7 to 8 feet tall with a wingspan of 20 feet or more. Because of its large wingspan, an aarakocra can carry as much as 75% of its own body weight and still fly easily. An aarakocra can fly a short distance carrying a burden equaling 125% of its own body weight. The average body weight of a full grown male is 100 pounds and a female is 85 pounds.</p><p>Each wing has a &ldquo;hand&rdquo; at its midpoint, consisting of three fingers and an opposable thumb. The fourth finger forms the rigid leading edge of the wing. In flight the hands cannot be used, but on the ground the aarakocra can use its hands almost as a human would. The aarakocra's body is protected by a thin bony plate on the chest, much like a solid rib cage. Talons on its legs can be used as claws and can be retracted to reveal a second set of hands, also with three fingers and an opposable thumb. Except for the chest plate, the entire skeleton is hollow and extremely fragile.</p><p>From a distance, the Athasian aarakocra resembles a huge <a href=\"/appendix/bird\">vulture</a>. Its black eyes, set in the front of the head, provide excellent vision over a long range. The plumage is generally black with a white collar for adult males and black or brown with a smaller white collar for females. Adolescents are a mixture of brown and black. The beak is large and covers most of the head. Plumage begins at the crown of the head and is darker near the head, except for the collar. Athasian aarakocra speak their own language and the languages of vultures and other large birds. Some speak the common tongue (5% to 10% chance depending on how deep in the wastelands a tribe lives).</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Combat:</b> Aarakocra can fight in the air or on the ground. They prefer aerial combat since their bones are too fragile to withstand a solid blow from a human-sized opponent. In combat against creatures on the ground, they prefer to fly over their victim and drop weighted nets. Some aarakocra use darts to harass ground-based opponents.</p><p>If their opponents can fly, the aarakocra generally forgo the use of the net, although large groups sometimes use nets on flying creatures. Normally, aarakocra attack flying creatures with long spears, diving from above and allowing the momentum to carry the spear through the target. Such an attack doubles the damage if the aarakocra have been able to dive at least 50 feet. Only the very largest aarakocra can carry more than one of these spears, they can attack with both at once with no penalty, causing double damage on each strike. All diving attacks are made at +4 and should be treated as a charge attack. All other penalties and restrictions of charge attacks apply.</p><p>The effect of the aarakocra's nets depends on if the opponent is flying at the time it becomes entangled. Creatures on the ground that are hit by a net are entangled and unable to participate in any combat until they make a successful Strength check to get free of the net. Flying creatures hit by a net can no longer fly and immediately begin falling. If they cannot escape the net or use some magical means to arrest the fall, normal falling damage applies.</p><p>Unless victims are entangled in nets, aarakocra are cautious in ground combat. If the aarakocra outnumber their opponents they advance in a straight line and thrust with their spears. If outnumbered, or the opponents are particularly tough, the aarakocra withdraw. Victims entangled in nets are killed or incapacitated for use as food or ransom.</p><p>Athasian aarakocra are mindful of their physical limitations as well as their comparatively low psionic abilities. They do not normally initiate psionic combat. At the first sign of psionic powers from any of their victims, however, all aarakocra that have some ability will use whatever attack and defense modes they can in an attempt to destroy the threat. Large groups of is or more aarakocra may initiate psionic combat if their leaders feel they can win quickly and avoid physical combat.</p><p>In desperation, an aarakocra can attempt to bite an opponent in combat. Because of the unwieldiness of its beak, the aarakocra has a THAC0 of 18 if attacking with this appendage. Further, the birdman causes only 1d2 points of damage with the beak.</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Habitat/Society:</b> Athasian aarakocra live in tribes with 6-20 (2d8+4) members, depending on the prestige of the leader. The largest tribe ever recorded had 50 members. The tribal hunting territory depends on the size of the tribe, usually about 500 square miles for a tribe of 10 members. There are no rigid boundaries between tribes and border disputes are not uncommon.</p><p>Alignments of tribe members are similar to the alignment of the leader. A tribe that has a leader who is neutral good may have neutral good, chaotic good, lawful good, and true neutral members. A predominantly evil tribe does not recognize boundaries with other tribes and treats other tribes as inferior beings to be eliminated.</p><p>Athasian aarakocra aren't happy in enclosed spaces, but they they take refuge in a cave or building if necessary.</p><p>Nonevil tribes live in rocky aeries in the highest peaks they can find. Evil tribes are normally nomadic and use an aerie made by another tribe if they need to remain in an area for a long time, even if they have to evict the tribe that made the nest.</p><p>Aarakocra aren't friendly toward intruders in their territory, especially caravans. They try to extract a toll from the caravan for passage through the desert. Good-aligned tribes allow unhindered passage of caravans that pay a tribute. If someone refuses to pay the tribute, the aarakocra try to capture scouts or outriders from the party and hold them until an even larger tribute is paid. The payment may be either livestock or shiny objects. Aarakocra are smart enough not to be taken in by glass baubles instead of gems, although they cannot tell the difference between the more common gems and the rare ones.</p><p>Evil tribes ask for tribute and often attack a caravan whether it pays or not. Aarakocra always demand shiny objects such as stones. These tribes find humans and demihumans to be quite tasty and prefer them to other food.</p><p>Good-aligned tribes of aarakocra sometimes return a lost traveler to the edge of the desert after first removing any valuables the traveler may be carrying. On very rare occasions a tribe might return a lost group of travelers to the more frequently traveled parts of the desert, again after first taking any valuables as payment.</p><p>The oldest male is the leader of the tribal hunting party and has 4+4 Hit Dice. The oldest female is in charge of the tribal aerie and has 3+3 HD. In tribes that have more than 15 members, the next oldest aarakocra serves as shaman and has 3+3 HD; the shaman completes the triumvirate necessary for proper worship and the summoning of elementals. (Interestingly, no magic-using aarakocra has ever been recorded.) Tribes without a shaman cannot summon <a href=\"/appendix/element1\">air elementals</a>, which is an important part of aarakocra culture.</p><p>The shaman is the leader of the daily sun worship. Aarakocra worship the sun because it provides them with the thermals they need to soar in search of food. The shaman also leads the mystic rituals used to summon an air elemental. Summoning an air elemental is usually done only in preparation for the tribe's most sacred ceremony, the hunt. Small tribes must band together for this ceremony to allow the triumvirate to be formed.</p><p>The ceremony to summon an air elemental must be conducted at dawn and requires the oldest male and female to emit a highpitched keening whistle. The shaman conducts an intricate dance around them, simultaneously chanting an ancient summoning mantra.</p><p>The hunt is the final part of the initiation of adolescent aarakocra to adulthood and often takes the tribe far from their normal teritory. The target is always a <a href=\"/appendix/drakalsi\">silt drake</a>. The hunt is the only time the females leave the relative safety of the nest. Even an evil tribe will not interfere with a tribe on a hunt. An air elemental is often summoned to help find the drake, but never takes part in the actual combat. Although the adult members of the tribe take part in the initial phases of the combat, it is the initiates who deliver the final, killing blows to me drake. Scars from the hunt are considered a mark of pride among all aarakocra.</p><p>The females spend about eight months of the year incubating their eggs. Athasian aarakocra mate for life and a pair normally produces as many as 10 offspring. A female lays one egg a year. Constant incubation is not required because of the high daytime temperatures, so the females can maintain the nest and keep the tribe's treasure in order.</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Ecology:</b> Athasian aarakocra are high on the food chain and have no natural enemies other than <a href=\"/appendix/drakatha\">drakes</a>. Unless evil, aarakocra leave their own territory only to hunt the silt drake and return as soon as possible when the hunt is over. (Evil aarakocra attack others, as noted above.) Aarakocra eggs and hatchlings are sought after by wealthy land owners who wish to use the creatures as scouts and sentries. An egg can bring as much as 10 cp in Tyr's marketplace. Tribes that have had eggs or hatchlings stolen have long memories and sometimes take revenge against the thief at a later date. Captive aarakocra join any tribe they come in contact with.</p><p>Athasian aarakocra have a natural life span of 21-30 years.</p><p></p><br clear=\"all\" style=\"clear:both; height:0;\">\r\n","images":["<img src=\"grf/ds.gif\" width=\"150\" height=\"75\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Dark Sun\" title=\"Dark Sun\" align=\"right\">","<img src=\"img/aarakath.gif\" alt=\"Aarakocra (Athas)\" title=\"Aarakocra (Athas)\" border=\"0\" width=\"300\" height=\"360\" style=\"text-align:right;\" align=\"right\">","<img src=\"grf/add2_01.gif\" width=\"200\" height=\"56\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Advanced Dungeons & Dragons 2nd Edition\">"],"setting":"Dark Sun","statblock":{"Aarakocra (Athas)":{"Activity Cycle":"Day","Alignment":"Any","Armor Class":"7","Climate/Terrain":"Deep desert","Damage/Attack":"1d3/1d3 or by weapon","Diet":"Carnivore","Frequency":"Rare","Hit Dice":"2+2","Intelligence":"Average (8-10)","Magic Resistance":"Nil","Morale":"Steady (11)","Movement":"6, Fl 36 (C)","No. Appearing":"1d10","No. of Attacks":"2","Organization":"Tribal","Size":"M (20'+ wingspan)","Special Attacks":"Nil","Special Defenses":"Nil","THAC0":"17","Treasure":"Varies","XP Value":"65"}},"title":"Aarakocra (Athas)"},"sources":["2433"],"statblock_names":[],"title":"Aarakocra (Athas)","prev_key":"zygraat","next_key":"aarakocr","monster_path":"/appendix/aarakath"}}},"pageContext":{"monster_key":"mummcrea","monster_data":{"TSR":["2158"],"fullBody":"  <table cellspacing=\"0\" cellpadding=\"0\"><tr class=\"bk\"><th> </th><th class=\"cn\">Animal</th><th class=\"cn\">Monster</th></tr><tr><th>Climate/Terrain:</th><td>Arid, arctic, barren</td><td>Arid, arctic, barren</td></tr><tr><th>Frequency:</th><td>Rare</td><td>Very rare</td></tr><tr><th>Organization:</th><td>Pack</td><td>Solitary</td></tr><tr><th>Activity Cycle:</th><td>Night</td><td>Night</td></tr><tr><th>Diet:</th><td>Omnivore</td><td>None</td></tr><tr><th>Intelligence:</th><td>Low (5-7)</td><td>Average (8-10)</td></tr><tr><th>Treasure:</th><td>Nil (R)</td><td>Nil (I)</td></tr><tr><th>Alignment:</th><td>Neutral evil</td><td>Neutral evil</td></tr><tr><th>No. Appearing:</th><td>1-8</td><td>1-4</td></tr><tr><th>Armor Class:</th><td>6*</td><td>3*</td></tr><tr><th>Movement:</th><td>12</td><td>9</td></tr><tr><th>Hit Dice:</th><td>+1 HD+3 hp</td><td>+2 HD+3 hp</td></tr><tr><th>THAC0:</th><td>Varies</td><td>Varies</td></tr><tr><th>No. of Attacks:</th><td>By type</td><td>By type</td></tr><tr><th>Damage/Attack:</th><td>Varies +1</td><td>Varies +2</td></tr><tr><th>Special Attacks:</th><td>Fear, disease</td><td>Fear, disease, curse, special</td></tr><tr><th>Special Defenses:</th><td>See below</td><td>See below</td></tr><tr><th>Magic Resistance:</th><td>Nil</td><td>Nil</td></tr><tr><th>Size:</th><td>S-M</td><td>Varies</td></tr><tr><th>Morale:</th><td>Elite (13)</td><td>Champion (15)</td></tr><tr><th>XP Value:</th><td>Base +5 levels</td><td>Base +6 levels</td></tr></table><p class=\"f\">Creature <a href=\"/appendix/mummy\">mummies</a> are undead whose bodies are preserved, then animated by their restless spirits. They draw their power from the Plane of Positive Fnergy. Most creature mummies are dessicated, dried corprs preserved from rot with spices, protective wrappings, and an arid environment. However, some may be preserved by baking or freezing the body, by airless internment in tar, by the use of salves or alchcJnical baths, or by preservative magics or curses.</p><p>All creature mummies are fixated on a single purpose for their existance, whether this is a hatred of the living, a consuming need for revenge or a mystical geas to act as a guardian or an agent for some mission. Animal mummies are often the minions of powerful mummies or other undead. Monster mummies may have been created to serve as an undying guardian of some ancient secret or treasure.</p><p>Creature mummies vary in appearance. Most are swathed in bandages or have withered flesh dyed green, mhre, blue or violet with an herbal or salve preservative tincture; other hues such as black and russet may occur. Some creature mummies may look skeletal or alive, with or without funerary wrappings. Often vital organs, such as the heart, brain, liver, or pancreas have been removed and preserved in separate jars. The creature may be invulnerable to destruction without the destruction of these parts as well.</p><p>Many creature mummies have a distinctive odor due to the preservation process. Variations on odors run from spices: cinnamon, ginger, saltpeter, roses, myrrh, frankincense, lye and pomegranates, to scents of the grave: fresh earth, vegetable rot, and decaying flesh. Occasionally mummies exude surprising odors, such as the smell of fresh bread (yeast), wine, vinegar, and roast viandes.</p><p>Mummy animals can see in the dark, having infravision to 30 feet; monsters see to 60 feet. Animals may have other heightened senses based on the type. Creature mummies are supernaturally strong; the more powerful have strength rivaling that of a <a href=\"/appendix/vampire\">vampire</a>.</p><p>Only creature mummies with average intchgence or better and a tongue and lips can speak in their native language. though haltingly.</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Combat:</b> The sight of a creature mummy is horrifying: the living who see one must save vs. spell or be paralyzed for 1d4 rounds. More powerful creature mummies penalize the saving throw by -1 to 4, and their aura causes fear (as the spell) or dread (-2 penalty to all rolls). There is strength in numbers for the living; for every 6, each saving throw is improved by +1. Humans have an additional +2 bonus to this saving throw.</p><p>Creature mummies attack using natural weapons - ragged claws, snarled teeth, tusks and hooves - inflicting bloody wounds. The type of attack is determined by the animal or monster the mummy is derived from. Successful natural attacks require a saving throw vs. poison to avoid infection with a dread disease, most commonly <i>mummy rot</i>. Other diseases include <i>deadeye</i> (blindness), <i>heartsting</i> (cardiac disease), <i>deathbite</i> (virulent poison), and <i>palsy</i> (involuntary muscle spasms causing action penalties and exhaustion). Weapons wielded by creature mummies do not transmit disease.</p><p><i>Cure wound</i> spells will not heal a diseased creature, though normal rest will restore 1 hit point per 10 days. Mummy rot reduces a victim's Charisma by 2 points, and drains 1 point of Strength and Constitution each week until fatal. Other mummy afflictions become progressively worse if left untreated, eventually killing the afflicted. A <i>cure disease</i> spell can cure the victim.</p><p>Creature mummies may retain a special attack from their mortal form: mummified serpents may be venomous, <a href=\"/appendix/sphinx\">sphinxes</a> may have a fearsome roar, <a href=\"/appendix/bird\">birds</a> may fly, <a href=\"/appendix/ettercap\">ettercaps</a> may spin webs, shamans may still cast spells, and so on. But the most diabolical ability is the innate cunning of creature mummies, since undead creatures are traditionally viewed as dull and slow-witted.</p><p>Only magical or special weapons can harm a creature mummy. Magical weapons inflict half damage; any special weapons the creature is vulnerable to (one of cold iron, silver, an arcane metal, special wood, etc.) inflict only half damage.</p><p>More powerful creature mummies may be immune to damage from special weapons and suffer only half damage from magical weapons.</p><p>Creature mummies possess many of the immunities of other undead. Sleep, charm, hold, poison, paralysis and cold attacks cause no damage. More powerful creature mummies may be immune to a second form of elemental energy. Unlike other undead, healing magic will rejuvenate the damaged form.</p><p>Most creature mummies are vulnerable to fire. A torch inflicts 1d3 points of damage and an oil flask causes 1d8 points on the first round and 2d8 the second round. Magical fires cause +1 per die of damage.</p><p>Creature mummies are turned by priests and paladins according to their Hit Dice, treating bonus hit points of 4 or more as another Hit Die. More powerful creature mummies may cause a penalty of -1 to -4 to the turn roll. If the turn attempt is successful 2d6 creatures are turned minus the power of the mummy's penalty.</p><p>Holy water dissolves a creature mummy's flesh, inflicting 2d4 points of damage if thrown on the creature, though the more powerful ones may be resistant to this damage.</p><p>Creature mummies are able to rejuvenate their damaged form through their connection to the Positive Material Plane. While weaker ones may be destroyed by physical damage, the more powerful ones can reconstitute their forms even if completely destroyed.</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Habitat/Society:</b> Creature mummies tend to either dwell on their past or rail against the loss of their life for this unending torment of unlife. Most remain dormant for long periods of time, lying within their tombs until intruders invade it or threaten their charge or mission. Then they become cunning, unstoppable juggernauts intent on bringing down their opponents so that they may return to their rest.</p><p>The true tombs of creature mummies are hidden from grave robbers through a series of false chambers and traps in the heart of a crypt. Often the final resting place contains funerary treasures and possessions from its previous life - foodstuffs, bodies of slain comrades, tools, and riches. Often these items, if removed without deference and a series of proper rituals, will trigger a curse that may haunt the robber unto death.</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Ecology:</b> Creature mummies may be created in a variety of ways. Their reanimation may result from intense death throes coupled by a will to live, invocation from dark priestly rituals, or creation by a necromancer or some powerful undead creature.</p><p>Creature mummies rarely eat, but might consume some substance, elixir, or energy in order to retain their vitality or rejuvenate or repair their form. The greatest need for most of them is to fulfill their guardianship or task.</p><p>Besides the (often cursed) treasures that they guard, a destroyed creature mummy may provide valuable materials in the form of its dust or ceremonial wrappings, which are considered valuable by scholars and alchemists for concocting restorative, regenerative, and rejuvenating salves, powders, and other magics.</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Animal Mummy</b></p><p class=\"ni\">An animal mummy's statistics are determined by its abilities in life. Its Hit Dice are the same as those in life, plus 1 HD + 3 hp. Movement is its natural speed to a maximum of 12 (flying 24), depending on how well the physical form is preserved. Armor Class is the natural armor class, bit no worse than 6.</p><p>Animal mummies retain any natural abilities they had in life, if they retain an non-skeletal form. Skeletal form mummies lose any hiding, flight, swimming, scent and sighting abilities. Instead, they gain an inate cunning, beyond the norm.</p><p>In combat, animal mummies retain their natural damage plus a bonus of +1 damage due to their extraordinary strength.</p><table class=\"ip\"><caption>Typical Animal Mummies</caption><tr class=\"bk\"><th> </th><th>MV</th><th>AC</th><th>Base Dmg</th><th>Typical Specials</th></tr><tr><td><a href=\"/appendix/baboon\">Baboon</a></td><td>12*</td><td>6</td><td>1d4</td><td>Tool user</td></tr><tr><td><a href=\"/appendix/mammher2\">Bull</a></td><td>12</td><td>6</td><td>2d6</td><td>Charge: 3d4</td></tr><tr><td><a href=\"/appendix/dog\">Dog</a></td><td>12</td><td>6</td><td>2d4</td><td>Detect invisible</td></tr><tr><td><a href=\"/appendix/eagle\">Eagle</a>/<a href=\"/appendix/hawk\">hawk</a></td><td>1, Fl 24</td><td>6</td><td>1d2/1d2/1</td><td>Dive: Dmg&times;2</td></tr><tr><td><a href=\"/appendix/lizard\">Lizard, giant</a></td><td>12</td><td>5</td><td>1d8</td><td>On 20: Dmg&times;2 (cintinuous)</td></tr><tr><td><a href=\"/appendix/snake\">Snake, giant, constrictor</a></td><td>9</td><td>5</td><td>1d4/2d4</td><td>Constriction</td></tr></table><p class=\"ni\">*includes tree movement (brachiation) of 12</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Monster Mummy</b></p><p class=\"ni\">A monster mummy's statistics are determined by its abilities in life.
