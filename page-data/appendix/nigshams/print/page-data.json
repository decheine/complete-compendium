While the powers listed above are the most common, some aarakocra have different or additional powers.</p><p class=\"f\">A race of intelligent, birdlike creatures living in the deepest deserts of Athas, the rare Athasian <a href=\"/appendix/aarakocr\">aarakocra</a> spends its time soaring on thermals in search of food.</p><p>The aarakocra is 7 to 8 feet tall with a wingspan of 20 feet or more. Because of its large wingspan, an aarakocra can carry as much as 75% of its own body weight and still fly easily. An aarakocra can fly a short distance carrying a burden equaling 125% of its own body weight. The average body weight of a full grown male is 100 pounds and a female is 85 pounds.</p><p>Each wing has a &ldquo;hand&rdquo; at its midpoint, consisting of three fingers and an opposable thumb. The fourth finger forms the rigid leading edge of the wing. In flight the hands cannot be used, but on the ground the aarakocra can use its hands almost as a human would. The aarakocra's body is protected by a thin bony plate on the chest, much like a solid rib cage. Talons on its legs can be used as claws and can be retracted to reveal a second set of hands, also with three fingers and an opposable thumb. Except for the chest plate, the entire skeleton is hollow and extremely fragile.</p><p>From a distance, the Athasian aarakocra resembles a huge <a href=\"/appendix/bird\">vulture</a>. Its black eyes, set in the front of the head, provide excellent vision over a long range. The plumage is generally black with a white collar for adult males and black or brown with a smaller white collar for females. Adolescents are a mixture of brown and black. The beak is large and covers most of the head. Plumage begins at the crown of the head and is darker near the head, except for the collar. Athasian aarakocra speak their own language and the languages of vultures and other large birds. Some speak the common tongue (5% to 10% chance depending on how deep in the wastelands a tribe lives).</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Combat:</b> Aarakocra can fight in the air or on the ground. They prefer aerial combat since their bones are too fragile to withstand a solid blow from a human-sized opponent. In combat against creatures on the ground, they prefer to fly over their victim and drop weighted nets. Some aarakocra use darts to harass ground-based opponents.</p><p>If their opponents can fly, the aarakocra generally forgo the use of the net, although large groups sometimes use nets on flying creatures. Normally, aarakocra attack flying creatures with long spears, diving from above and allowing the momentum to carry the spear through the target. Such an attack doubles the damage if the aarakocra have been able to dive at least 50 feet. Only the very largest aarakocra can carry more than one of these spears, they can attack with both at once with no penalty, causing double damage on each strike. All diving attacks are made at +4 and should be treated as a charge attack. All other penalties and restrictions of charge attacks apply.</p><p>The effect of the aarakocra's nets depends on if the opponent is flying at the time it becomes entangled. Creatures on the ground that are hit by a net are entangled and unable to participate in any combat until they make a successful Strength check to get free of the net. Flying creatures hit by a net can no longer fly and immediately begin falling. If they cannot escape the net or use some magical means to arrest the fall, normal falling damage applies.</p><p>Unless victims are entangled in nets, aarakocra are cautious in ground combat. If the aarakocra outnumber their opponents they advance in a straight line and thrust with their spears. If outnumbered, or the opponents are particularly tough, the aarakocra withdraw. Victims entangled in nets are killed or incapacitated for use as food or ransom.</p><p>Athasian aarakocra are mindful of their physical limitations as well as their comparatively low psionic abilities. They do not normally initiate psionic combat. At the first sign of psionic powers from any of their victims, however, all aarakocra that have some ability will use whatever attack and defense modes they can in an attempt to destroy the threat. Large groups of is or more aarakocra may initiate psionic combat if their leaders feel they can win quickly and avoid physical combat.</p><p>In desperation, an aarakocra can attempt to bite an opponent in combat. Because of the unwieldiness of its beak, the aarakocra has a THAC0 of 18 if attacking with this appendage. Further, the birdman causes only 1d2 points of damage with the beak.</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Habitat/Society:</b> Athasian aarakocra live in tribes with 6-20 (2d8+4) members, depending on the prestige of the leader. The largest tribe ever recorded had 50 members. The tribal hunting territory depends on the size of the tribe, usually about 500 square miles for a tribe of 10 members. There are no rigid boundaries between tribes and border disputes are not uncommon.</p><p>Alignments of tribe members are similar to the alignment of the leader. A tribe that has a leader who is neutral good may have neutral good, chaotic good, lawful good, and true neutral members. A predominantly evil tribe does not recognize boundaries with other tribes and treats other tribes as inferior beings to be eliminated.</p><p>Athasian aarakocra aren't happy in enclosed spaces, but they they take refuge in a cave or building if necessary.</p><p>Nonevil tribes live in rocky aeries in the highest peaks they can find. Evil tribes are normally nomadic and use an aerie made by another tribe if they need to remain in an area for a long time, even if they have to evict the tribe that made the nest.</p><p>Aarakocra aren't friendly toward intruders in their territory, especially caravans. They try to extract a toll from the caravan for passage through the desert. Good-aligned tribes allow unhindered passage of caravans that pay a tribute. If someone refuses to pay the tribute, the aarakocra try to capture scouts or outriders from the party and hold them until an even larger tribute is paid. The payment may be either livestock or shiny objects. Aarakocra are smart enough not to be taken in by glass baubles instead of gems, although they cannot tell the difference between the more common gems and the rare ones.</p><p>Evil tribes ask for tribute and often attack a caravan whether it pays or not. Aarakocra always demand shiny objects such as stones. These tribes find humans and demihumans to be quite tasty and prefer them to other food.</p><p>Good-aligned tribes of aarakocra sometimes return a lost traveler to the edge of the desert after first removing any valuables the traveler may be carrying. On very rare occasions a tribe might return a lost group of travelers to the more frequently traveled parts of the desert, again after first taking any valuables as payment.</p><p>The oldest male is the leader of the tribal hunting party and has 4+4 Hit Dice. The oldest female is in charge of the tribal aerie and has 3+3 HD. In tribes that have more than 15 members, the next oldest aarakocra serves as shaman and has 3+3 HD; the shaman completes the triumvirate necessary for proper worship and the summoning of elementals. (Interestingly, no magic-using aarakocra has ever been recorded.) Tribes without a shaman cannot summon <a href=\"/appendix/element1\">air elementals</a>, which is an important part of aarakocra culture.</p><p>The shaman is the leader of the daily sun worship. Aarakocra worship the sun because it provides them with the thermals they need to soar in search of food. The shaman also leads the mystic rituals used to summon an air elemental. Summoning an air elemental is usually done only in preparation for the tribe's most sacred ceremony, the hunt. Small tribes must band together for this ceremony to allow the triumvirate to be formed.</p><p>The ceremony to summon an air elemental must be conducted at dawn and requires the oldest male and female to emit a highpitched keening whistle. The shaman conducts an intricate dance around them, simultaneously chanting an ancient summoning mantra.</p><p>The hunt is the final part of the initiation of adolescent aarakocra to adulthood and often takes the tribe far from their normal teritory. The target is always a <a href=\"/appendix/drakalsi\">silt drake</a>. The hunt is the only time the females leave the relative safety of the nest. Even an evil tribe will not interfere with a tribe on a hunt. An air elemental is often summoned to help find the drake, but never takes part in the actual combat. Although the adult members of the tribe take part in the initial phases of the combat, it is the initiates who deliver the final, killing blows to me drake. Scars from the hunt are considered a mark of pride among all aarakocra.</p><p>The females spend about eight months of the year incubating their eggs. Athasian aarakocra mate for life and a pair normally produces as many as 10 offspring. A female lays one egg a year. Constant incubation is not required because of the high daytime temperatures, so the females can maintain the nest and keep the tribe's treasure in order.</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Ecology:</b> Athasian aarakocra are high on the food chain and have no natural enemies other than <a href=\"/appendix/drakatha\">drakes</a>. Unless evil, aarakocra leave their own territory only to hunt the silt drake and return as soon as possible when the hunt is over. (Evil aarakocra attack others, as noted above.) Aarakocra eggs and hatchlings are sought after by wealthy land owners who wish to use the creatures as scouts and sentries. An egg can bring as much as 10 cp in Tyr's marketplace. Tribes that have had eggs or hatchlings stolen have long memories and sometimes take revenge against the thief at a later date. Captive aarakocra join any tribe they come in contact with.</p><p>Athasian aarakocra have a natural life span of 21-30 years.</p><p></p><br clear=\"all\" style=\"clear:both; height:0;\">\r\n","images":["<img src=\"grf/ds.gif\" width=\"150\" height=\"75\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Dark Sun\" title=\"Dark Sun\" align=\"right\">","<img src=\"img/aarakath.gif\" alt=\"Aarakocra (Athas)\" title=\"Aarakocra (Athas)\" border=\"0\" width=\"300\" height=\"360\" style=\"text-align:right;\" align=\"right\">","<img src=\"grf/add2_01.gif\" width=\"200\" height=\"56\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Advanced Dungeons & Dragons 2nd Edition\">"],"setting":"Dark Sun","statblock":{"Aarakocra (Athas)":{"Activity Cycle":"Day","Alignment":"Any","Armor Class":"7","Climate/Terrain":"Deep desert","Damage/Attack":"1d3/1d3 or by weapon","Diet":"Carnivore","Frequency":"Rare","Hit Dice":"2+2","Intelligence":"Average (8-10)","Magic Resistance":"Nil","Morale":"Steady (11)","Movement":"6, Fl 36 (C)","No. Appearing":"1d10","No. of Attacks":"2","Organization":"Tribal","Size":"M (20'+ wingspan)","Special Attacks":"Nil","Special Defenses":"Nil","THAC0":"17","Treasure":"Varies","XP Value":"65"}},"title":"Aarakocra (Athas)"},"sources":["2433"],"statblock_names":[],"title":"Aarakocra (Athas)","prev_key":"zygraat","next_key":"aarakocr","monster_path":"/appendix/aarakath"}}},"pageContext":{"monster_key":"nigshams","monster_data":{"TSR":["2501"],"fullBody":"  <table cellspacing=\"0\" cellpadding=\"0\"><tr class=\"bk\"><th> </th><th class=\"cn\">Nightcrawler</th><th class=\"cn\">Nightwalker</th><th class=\"cn\">Nightwing</th></tr><tr><th>Climate/Terrain:</th><td>Any</td><td>Any</td><td>Any</td></tr><tr><th>Frequency:</th><td>Very rare</td><td>Very rare</td><td>Very rare</td></tr><tr><th>Organization:</th><td>Solitary</td><td>Solitary</td><td>Solitary</td></tr><tr><th>Activity Cycle:</th><td>Night</td><td>Night</td><td>Night</td></tr><tr><th>Diet:</th><td>None</td><td>None</td><td>None</td></tr><tr><th>Intelligence:</th><td>Supra-genius (19-20)</td><td>Supra-genius (19-20)</td><td>Supra-genius (19-20)</td></tr><tr><th>Treasure:</th><td>U</td><td>U</td><td>U</td></tr><tr><th>Alignment:</th><td>Chaotic evil</td><td>Chaotic evil</td><td>Chaotic evil</td></tr><tr><th>No. Appearing:</th><td>1</td><td>1</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><th>Armor Class:</th><td>-4</td><td>-6</td><td>-8</td></tr><tr><th>Movement:</th><td>12, Br 24</td><td>15, Fl 6 (C)</td><td>3, Fl 24 (B)</td></tr><tr><th>Hit Dice:</th><td>25</td><td>21</td><td>17</td></tr><tr><th>THAC0:</th><td>4</td><td>5</td><td>5</td></tr><tr><th>No. of Attacks:</th><td>2</td><td>2</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><th>Damage/Attack:</th><td>2d10 (bite)/2d4 (sting)</td><td>3d10 (fist)/3d10 (fist)</td><td>1d6+6 (bite)</td></tr><tr><th>Special Attacks:</th><td>Surprise; see below</td><td>Surprise; see below</td><td>Surprise; see below</td></tr><tr><th>Special Defenses:</th><td>See below</td><td>See below</td><td>See below</td></tr><tr><th>Magic Resistance:</th><td>Nil</td><td>Nil</td><td>Nil</td></tr><tr><th>Size:</th><td>G (100' long)</td><td>H (20' tall)</td><td>G (30' long)</td></tr><tr><th>Morale:</th><td>Fearless (20)</td><td>Fearless (20)</td><td>Fearless (20)</td></tr><tr><th>XP Value:</th><td>19,000</td><td>18,000</td><td>17,000</td></tr></table><p class=\"f\">Nightshades are powerful beings from the Negative Energy who seek to spread death and destruction everywhere. Similar to undead, they are found on the Prime Material Plane only if summoned by powerful sorcerers for dark purposes.</p><p>All nightshades are jet black. The air around them is cold and smells like an open grave in winter. These creatures have no visible eyes and apparently sense their surroundings magically. They see invisible objects and <i>detect magic</i> at will.</p><p>Nightshades can read all magical writings and languages, although they cannot speak. They communicate with each other and their summoners telepathically. Nightshades never speak to their victims. Any creature that is not a nightshade or a summoner is considered a victim.</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Combat:</b> These aggressive monsters attack all strangers. They are usually encountered at night or in darkness. Natural daylight inflicts a -4 penalty on a nightshade's attack rolls, but light causes no other ill effects.</p><p>Because of their coloration and stealth abilities, nightshades have an increased chance to surprise opponents, as detailed in the paragraphs on each type below. This ability can, however, be negated by the chilling aura of a nightshade's presence; a nightshade noticeably chills the air within a 60-foot radius regardless of weather or temperature conditions. The chill of a nightshade is something no adventurer forgets, and an individual who has encountered a nightshade has the normal chance of being surprised by one in the future (thus, surprise penalties usually associated with the creatures are negated). The chill aura permeates solid substances, so that the aura will be felt by victims on the other side of a stone wall or above ground over a burrowing nightcrawler.</p><p>The nightshade's chilling presence spoils all consumable items within 60'. This affects rations, food, water, holy water, and magical potions, oils, and ointments. No saving throws are allowed for these items. Such materials do not become poisonous, but become so desiccated as to be useless.</p><p>The touch of a nightshade is poisonous. A victim successfully hit by a nightshade's natural attack (bite, sting, or fist) must roll a saving throw vs. poison with a -2 penalty. Failure results in instant death.</p><p>All nightshades can use the following spells at will, one per round: <i>charm person</i>, <i>invisibility</i>, <i>haste</i>, <i>confusion</i>, <i>cloudkill</i>, <i>darkness</i>, <i>hold person</i>, <i>cause disease</i>, and <i>dispel magic</i>. Once per day, nightshades can cast <i>finger of death</i>. The nightshade's spellcasting level is equal to its Hit Dice. If a nightshade uses a spell ability, it cannot make a melee attack that round.</p><p>Nightshades can summon undead once every four hours, with a 75% chance of success. The undead creatures arrive in 1d10 rounds. To learn the type of undead that responds, roll 1d8 and consult the following table:</p><table class=\"ip\"><tr class=\"bk\"><th>1d8 Roll</th><th>Undead</th></tr><tr><td>1-3</td><td>1d4+1 <a href=\"/appendix/shadow\">shadows</a></td></tr><tr><td>4-5</td><td>1d2 <a href=\"/appendix/wraith\">wraiths</a></td></tr><tr><td>6</td><td>1 <a href=\"/appendix/spectre\">spectre</a></td></tr><tr><td>7</td><td>1 <a href=\"/appendix/ghost\">ghost</a></td></tr><tr><td>8</td><td>1 <a href=\"/appendix/spirmyst\">spirit (hand druj)</a></td></tr></table><p>Nightshades can be harmed only by weapons of +3 or greater enchantment, or by spells of 6th level or greater. They are immune to all forms of poison, petrification, illusion, <i>charm</i>, <i>hold</i>, and cold spell effects.</p><p>Nightshades are partially vulnerable <a href=\"/appendix/dragon\">dragon</a> breath and suffer only half damage from such attacks. If nightshades roll successful saving throws, they suffer only only one-quarter damage, rounded up.</p><p>Nightshades are turned as &ldquo;special&rdquo; creatures.</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Habitat/Society:</b> Nightshades dwell on the Negative Energy Plane, which provides them with life-sustaining energy. They can travel to the Ethereal Plane at will, but must be summoned in order to enter the Prime Material Plane.</p><p>Nightshades are all extremely clever and wise, with both Intelligence and Wisdom scores of 19. This great mental capacity is a combination of the nightshade's own wiles and the knowledge from the mind of the spellcaster who summoned it. The creature can use its summoner's knowledge to function better on the Prime Material Plane. All people, places, and objects that the summoner knows are also known by the nightshade. A nightshade uses its great intellect to plan and scheme, and to invent plots using servants (usually undead).</p><p>As solitary creatures, nightshades do not associate in packs, families, or even with mates. Nightshades have an affinity for undead. Some sages suggest that when numerous undead beings are destroyed, the energies released on the Negative Energy Plane coalesce to form a nightshade. Others speculate that nightshades are related to <a href=\"/appendix/blacball\">blackballs</a>, and that blackballs are some sort of larval or metamorphosed form or perhaps nightshade &ldquo;eggs&rdquo;.</p><p>Whatever their origin, nightshades can be summoned to the Prime Material Plane by use of a powerful, complex spell. Certain evil wizards of at least 16th level know this spell, but guard the secret closely. Only one nightshade can be summoned with the spell. The spell must be cast in complete darkness: summoning usually takes place deep underground or during the dark of the new moon.</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Ecology:</b> These unnatural, extraplanar creatures seldom interact with the environment. However, when on the Prime Material Plane, a nightshade is a destructive force capable of greatly disrupting a local ecology; a nightshade always causes death and often drives normal life forms away.</p><p>Nightshades always have treasure of great value; they swallow their treasure in order to carry it. They scorn coins, favoring instead gems, jewelly, art objects, and magical treasures. Nightshades collect treasure from their victims after a battle.</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Nightcrawler</b></p>  <p class=\"ni\">Nightcrawlers are similar to <a href=\"/appendix/worm\">purple worms</a> in appearance, and measure about 100 feet long and 10 to 15 feet wide. Nightcrawlers are pitch black in color.</p><p>These creatures can approach an opponent by burrowing underground and attacking from below. If this is done, a -2 penalty is added to the victim's surprise roll (unless the nightshade's chill aura negates the penalty).</p><p>A nightcrawler's bite inflicts 2d10 points of damage; like any successful attack from a nightshade, the victim must succeed a saving throw vs. poison with a -2 penalty or die immediately. In addition, a nightcrawler automatically swallows its victim if the attack roll is an unmodified 19 or 20. A swallowed victim loses one level of experience per round due to the nightshade's negative energy, though a <i>protection from evil</i> or <i>negative plane protection</i> spell prevents this drain.</p><p>The nightcrawler's tail stinger causes 2d4 points of damage on a successful hit. A victim of the sting must roll a saving throw vs. poison; however, the stinger is so potent that the saving throw is made with a -4 penalty instead of the -2 penalty associated with other nightshade attacks.</p><p>Once per turn, the nightcrawler can reduce one opponent to 20% nf original size (as if casting the reversed enlarge spell at 8th level). The nightcrawler cannot attack physically in the same round that it uses the reduce power. The victim can roll a saving throw vs. spell to avoid the effect. A nightcrawler swallows a reduced victim whole on an attack roll of 15 to 20.</p><p></p><p class=\"f\"><b>Nightwalker</b></p>  <p class=\"ni\">A nightwalker is a 20-foot-tal1, jet black, giant humanoid. It lurks in dark areas: opponents suffer a -2 penalty to surprise rolls. The nightwalker never carries weapons or other items; it attacks with its two massive fists each round, causing 3d10 points of damage with each successful hit. In addition, a victim must roll a saving throw vs. poison or die.</p><p>A nightwalker's attack can crush an opponent's shield or armor. Such damage is applied first to a victim's shield (if any); once it is destroyed, damage is then applied to armor. The item in question avoids the crushing effect if a successful saving throw vs. crushing blow is made; magical armors and shields add their magical bonuses to the saving throws (the bonus equals the item's bonus to Armor Class).</p><p>A nightwalker can automatically destroy any weapon or magical item simply by picking it up and smashing it flat between its hands. It cannot harm artifacts in this manner. If the item is held by an opponent, the nightshade must make a successful attack roll to grab it. No saving throw applies against this crushing effect. The nightshade cannot use its hands for anythmg else in the same round.</p><p>Once per round, a nightwalker can gaze at one opponent up to 60' away. The victim must make a successful saving throw vs. spell to avoid the gaze. If the saving throw fails, the victim is <i>cursed</i>, suffering a -4 penalty to all attack rolls and saving throws until a <i>dispel evil</i> or <i>remove curse</i> spell is cast on the victim; <i>remove curse</i> is ineffective if performed by a caster of less than 15th level. The nightwalker can use this gaze as often as it wishes, although it cannot attack while attempting the gaze. A victim can be affected by the gaze only once (until the curse is removed; after that, a victim could fall prey to the gaze again).</p><p></p><p class=\"f\"><b>Nightwing</b></p>  <p class=\"ni\">The nightwing is a giant, jet black <a href=\"/appendix/bat\">bat</a> with a 50-foot wingspan. Its initial attack is usually a dive. It gives a -6 penalty to the victim's surprise roll (though the surprise penalty can be negated if victims recognize the nightshade's chilling aura). The dive is treated as a charge, granting the nightshade a +2 bonus to attack rolls and a +1 penalty to Armor Class, but giving opponents a -2 bonus to initiative.</p><p>Nightwings do not carry the poison effect of other nightshades. However, any victim hit by a nightwing must make a successful saving throw vs. spell or be transformed into a <a href=\"/appendix/bat\">giant bat</a> as if affected by a <i>polymorph other</i> spell. Anyone turned into a bat is <i>charmed</i> and will obey the nightwing. These effects last until dispelled.</p><p>A nightwing can attempt to strike a victim's magical items. It may target only shields and weapons. It suffers a -4 penalty to the attack roll. If the attack succeeds, the item is drained of one point of macrical bonus (thus, a +2 sword becomes a +1 sword). The stolen magical bonuses can be restored by a dispel evil spell, but the spell must be cast within a number of days equal to the dispelling caster's level.</p><p></p><br clear=\"all\" style=\"clear:both; height:0;\">\r\n","images":["<img src=\"grf/ms.gif\" width=\"150\" height=\"75\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Mystara\" title=\"Mystara\" align=\"right\">","<img src=\"img/nigshams.gif\" alt=\"Nightshade (Mystara)\" title=\"Nightshade (Mystara)\" border=\"0\" width=\"300\" height=\"360\" style=\"text-align:right;\" align=\"right\">","<img src=\"grf/add2_01.gif\" width=\"200\" height=\"56\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Advanced Dungeons & Dragons 2nd Edition\">"],"setting":"Mystara","statblock":{"Nightcrawler":{"Activity Cycle":"Night","Alignment":"Chaotic evil","Armor Class":"-4","Climate/Terrain":"Any","Damage/Attack":"2d10 (bite)/2d4 (sting)","Diet":"None","Frequency":"Very rare","Hit Dice":"25","Intelligence":"Supra-genius (19-20)","Magic Resistance":"Nil","Morale":"Fearless (20)","Movement":"12, Br 24","No. Appearing":"1","No. of Attacks":"2","Organization":"Solitary","Size":"G (100' long)","Special Attacks":"Surprise; see below","Special Defenses":"See below","THAC0":"4","Treasure":"U","XP Value":"19,000"},"Nightwalker":{"Activity Cycle":"Night","Alignment":"Chaotic evil","Armor Class":"-6","Climate/Terrain":"Any","Damage/Attack":"3d10 (fist)/3d10 (fist)","Diet":"None","Frequency":"Very rare","Hit Dice":"21","Intelligence":"Supra-genius (19-20)","Magic Resistance":"Nil","Morale":"Fearless (20)","Movement":"15, Fl 6 (C)","No. Appearing":"1","No. of Attacks":"2","Organization":"Solitary","Size":"H (20' tall)","Special Attacks":"Surprise; see below","Special Defenses":"See below","THAC0":"5","Treasure":"U","XP Value":"18,000"},"Nightwing":{"Activity Cycle":"Night","Alignment":"Chaotic evil","Armor Class":"-8","Climate/Terrain":"Any","Damage/Attack":"1d6+6 (bite)","Diet":"None","Frequency":"Very rare","Hit Dice":"17","Intelligence":"Supra-genius (19-20)","Magic Resistance":"Nil","Morale":"Fearless (20)","Movement":"3, Fl 24 (B)","No. Appearing":"1","No. of Attacks":"1","Organization":"Solitary","Size":"G (30' long)","Special Attacks":"Surprise; see below","Special Defenses":"See below","THAC0":"5","Treasure":"U","XP Value":"17,000"}},"title":"Nightshade (Mystara)"},"sources":["2501"],"statblock_names":[],"title":"Nightshade (Mystara)","prev_key":"nigmarma","next_key":"nigshato","monster_path":"/appendix/nigshams"}},"staticQueryHashes":[],"slicesMap":{}}
