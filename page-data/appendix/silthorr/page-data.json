While the powers listed above are the most common, some aarakocra have different or additional powers.</p><p class=\"f\">A race of intelligent, birdlike creatures living in the deepest deserts of Athas, the rare Athasian <a href=\"/appendix/aarakocr\">aarakocra</a> spends its time soaring on thermals in search of food.</p><p>The aarakocra is 7 to 8 feet tall with a wingspan of 20 feet or more. Because of its large wingspan, an aarakocra can carry as much as 75% of its own body weight and still fly easily. An aarakocra can fly a short distance carrying a burden equaling 125% of its own body weight. The average body weight of a full grown male is 100 pounds and a female is 85 pounds.</p><p>Each wing has a &ldquo;hand&rdquo; at its midpoint, consisting of three fingers and an opposable thumb. The fourth finger forms the rigid leading edge of the wing. In flight the hands cannot be used, but on the ground the aarakocra can use its hands almost as a human would. The aarakocra's body is protected by a thin bony plate on the chest, much like a solid rib cage. Talons on its legs can be used as claws and can be retracted to reveal a second set of hands, also with three fingers and an opposable thumb. Except for the chest plate, the entire skeleton is hollow and extremely fragile.</p><p>From a distance, the Athasian aarakocra resembles a huge <a href=\"/appendix/bird\">vulture</a>. Its black eyes, set in the front of the head, provide excellent vision over a long range. The plumage is generally black with a white collar for adult males and black or brown with a smaller white collar for females. Adolescents are a mixture of brown and black. The beak is large and covers most of the head. Plumage begins at the crown of the head and is darker near the head, except for the collar. Athasian aarakocra speak their own language and the languages of vultures and other large birds. Some speak the common tongue (5% to 10% chance depending on how deep in the wastelands a tribe lives).</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Combat:</b> Aarakocra can fight in the air or on the ground. They prefer aerial combat since their bones are too fragile to withstand a solid blow from a human-sized opponent. In combat against creatures on the ground, they prefer to fly over their victim and drop weighted nets. Some aarakocra use darts to harass ground-based opponents.</p><p>If their opponents can fly, the aarakocra generally forgo the use of the net, although large groups sometimes use nets on flying creatures. Normally, aarakocra attack flying creatures with long spears, diving from above and allowing the momentum to carry the spear through the target. Such an attack doubles the damage if the aarakocra have been able to dive at least 50 feet. Only the very largest aarakocra can carry more than one of these spears, they can attack with both at once with no penalty, causing double damage on each strike. All diving attacks are made at +4 and should be treated as a charge attack. All other penalties and restrictions of charge attacks apply.</p><p>The effect of the aarakocra's nets depends on if the opponent is flying at the time it becomes entangled. Creatures on the ground that are hit by a net are entangled and unable to participate in any combat until they make a successful Strength check to get free of the net. Flying creatures hit by a net can no longer fly and immediately begin falling. If they cannot escape the net or use some magical means to arrest the fall, normal falling damage applies.</p><p>Unless victims are entangled in nets, aarakocra are cautious in ground combat. If the aarakocra outnumber their opponents they advance in a straight line and thrust with their spears. If outnumbered, or the opponents are particularly tough, the aarakocra withdraw. Victims entangled in nets are killed or incapacitated for use as food or ransom.</p><p>Athasian aarakocra are mindful of their physical limitations as well as their comparatively low psionic abilities. They do not normally initiate psionic combat. At the first sign of psionic powers from any of their victims, however, all aarakocra that have some ability will use whatever attack and defense modes they can in an attempt to destroy the threat. Large groups of is or more aarakocra may initiate psionic combat if their leaders feel they can win quickly and avoid physical combat.</p><p>In desperation, an aarakocra can attempt to bite an opponent in combat. Because of the unwieldiness of its beak, the aarakocra has a THAC0 of 18 if attacking with this appendage. Further, the birdman causes only 1d2 points of damage with the beak.</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Habitat/Society:</b> Athasian aarakocra live in tribes with 6-20 (2d8+4) members, depending on the prestige of the leader. The largest tribe ever recorded had 50 members. The tribal hunting territory depends on the size of the tribe, usually about 500 square miles for a tribe of 10 members. There are no rigid boundaries between tribes and border disputes are not uncommon.</p><p>Alignments of tribe members are similar to the alignment of the leader. A tribe that has a leader who is neutral good may have neutral good, chaotic good, lawful good, and true neutral members. A predominantly evil tribe does not recognize boundaries with other tribes and treats other tribes as inferior beings to be eliminated.</p><p>Athasian aarakocra aren't happy in enclosed spaces, but they they take refuge in a cave or building if necessary.</p><p>Nonevil tribes live in rocky aeries in the highest peaks they can find. Evil tribes are normally nomadic and use an aerie made by another tribe if they need to remain in an area for a long time, even if they have to evict the tribe that made the nest.</p><p>Aarakocra aren't friendly toward intruders in their territory, especially caravans. They try to extract a toll from the caravan for passage through the desert. Good-aligned tribes allow unhindered passage of caravans that pay a tribute. If someone refuses to pay the tribute, the aarakocra try to capture scouts or outriders from the party and hold them until an even larger tribute is paid. The payment may be either livestock or shiny objects. Aarakocra are smart enough not to be taken in by glass baubles instead of gems, although they cannot tell the difference between the more common gems and the rare ones.</p><p>Evil tribes ask for tribute and often attack a caravan whether it pays or not. Aarakocra always demand shiny objects such as stones. These tribes find humans and demihumans to be quite tasty and prefer them to other food.</p><p>Good-aligned tribes of aarakocra sometimes return a lost traveler to the edge of the desert after first removing any valuables the traveler may be carrying. On very rare occasions a tribe might return a lost group of travelers to the more frequently traveled parts of the desert, again after first taking any valuables as payment.</p><p>The oldest male is the leader of the tribal hunting party and has 4+4 Hit Dice. The oldest female is in charge of the tribal aerie and has 3+3 HD. In tribes that have more than 15 members, the next oldest aarakocra serves as shaman and has 3+3 HD; the shaman completes the triumvirate necessary for proper worship and the summoning of elementals. (Interestingly, no magic-using aarakocra has ever been recorded.) Tribes without a shaman cannot summon <a href=\"/appendix/element1\">air elementals</a>, which is an important part of aarakocra culture.</p><p>The shaman is the leader of the daily sun worship. Aarakocra worship the sun because it provides them with the thermals they need to soar in search of food. The shaman also leads the mystic rituals used to summon an air elemental. Summoning an air elemental is usually done only in preparation for the tribe's most sacred ceremony, the hunt. Small tribes must band together for this ceremony to allow the triumvirate to be formed.</p><p>The ceremony to summon an air elemental must be conducted at dawn and requires the oldest male and female to emit a highpitched keening whistle. The shaman conducts an intricate dance around them, simultaneously chanting an ancient summoning mantra.</p><p>The hunt is the final part of the initiation of adolescent aarakocra to adulthood and often takes the tribe far from their normal teritory. The target is always a <a href=\"/appendix/drakalsi\">silt drake</a>. The hunt is the only time the females leave the relative safety of the nest. Even an evil tribe will not interfere with a tribe on a hunt. An air elemental is often summoned to help find the drake, but never takes part in the actual combat. Although the adult members of the tribe take part in the initial phases of the combat, it is the initiates who deliver the final, killing blows to me drake. Scars from the hunt are considered a mark of pride among all aarakocra.</p><p>The females spend about eight months of the year incubating their eggs. Athasian aarakocra mate for life and a pair normally produces as many as 10 offspring. A female lays one egg a year. Constant incubation is not required because of the high daytime temperatures, so the females can maintain the nest and keep the tribe's treasure in order.</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Ecology:</b> Athasian aarakocra are high on the food chain and have no natural enemies other than <a href=\"/appendix/drakatha\">drakes</a>. Unless evil, aarakocra leave their own territory only to hunt the silt drake and return as soon as possible when the hunt is over. (Evil aarakocra attack others, as noted above.) Aarakocra eggs and hatchlings are sought after by wealthy land owners who wish to use the creatures as scouts and sentries. An egg can bring as much as 10 cp in Tyr's marketplace. Tribes that have had eggs or hatchlings stolen have long memories and sometimes take revenge against the thief at a later date. Captive aarakocra join any tribe they come in contact with.</p><p>Athasian aarakocra have a natural life span of 21-30 years.</p><br clear=\"all\" style=\"clear:both; height:0;\">\r\n","images":["<img src=\"grf/ds.gif\" width=\"150\" height=\"75\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Dark Sun\" title=\"Dark Sun\" align=\"right\">","<img src=\"img/aarakath.gif\" alt=\"Aarakocra (Athas)\" title=\"Aarakocra (Athas)\" border=\"0\" width=\"300\" height=\"360\" style=\"text-align:right;\" align=\"right\">","<img src=\"grf/add2_01.gif\" width=\"200\" height=\"56\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Advanced Dungeons & Dragons 2nd Edition\">"],"setting":"Dark Sun","statblock":{"Aarakocra (Athas)":{"Activity Cycle":"Day","Alignment":"Any","Armor Class":"7","Climate/Terrain":"Deep desert","Damage/Attack":"1d3/1d3 or by weapon","Diet":"Carnivore","Frequency":"Rare","Hit Dice":"2+2","Intelligence":"Average (8-10)","Magic Resistance":"Nil","Morale":"Steady (11)","Movement":"6, Fl 36 (C)","No. Appearing":"1d10","No. of Attacks":"2","Organization":"Tribal","Size":"M (20'+ wingspan)","Special Attacks":"Nil","Special Defenses":"Nil","THAC0":"17","Treasure":"Varies","XP Value":"65"}},"title":"Aarakocra (Athas)"},"sources":["2433"],"statblock_names":[],"title":"Aarakocra (Athas)","prev_key":"zygraat","next_key":"aarakocr","monster_path":"/appendix/aarakath"}}},"pageContext":{"monster_key":"silthorr","monster_data":{"TSR":["2405"],"fullBody":"  <table cellspacing=\"0\" cellpadding=\"0\"><tr class=\"bk\"><th> </th><th class=\"cn\">White Horror</th><th class=\"cn\">Brown Horror</th><th class=\"cn\">Gray Horror</th></tr><tr><th>Climate/Terrain:</th><td>Any Silt</td><td>Any Silt</td><td>Any Silt</td></tr><tr><th>Frequency:</th><td>Uncommon</td><td>Very rare</td><td>Rare</td></tr><tr><th>Organization:</th><td>Solitary</td><td>Solitary</td><td>Solitary</td></tr><tr><th>Activity Cycle:</th><td>Any</td><td>Any</td><td>Any</td></tr><tr><th>Diet:</th><td>Carnivore</td><td>Carnivore</td><td>Carnivore</td></tr><tr><th>Intelligence:</th><td>Animal (1)</td><td>Semi- (2-4)</td><td>Semi- (2-4)</td></tr><tr><th>Treasure:</th><td>Nil</td><td>Nil</td><td>Nil</td></tr><tr><th>Alignment:</th><td>Neutral</td><td>Neutral</td><td>Neutral</td></tr><tr><th>No. Appearing:</th><td>1</td><td>1</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><th>Armor Class:</th><td>8</td><td>7</td><td>7</td></tr><tr><th>Movement:</th><td>3</td><td>3</td><td>6</td></tr><tr><th>Hit Dice:</th><td>14</td><td>9</td><td>12</td></tr><tr><th>THAC0:</th><td>7</td><td>11</td><td>9</td></tr><tr><th>No. of Attacks:</th><td>10</td><td>8</td><td>12</td></tr><tr><th>Damage/Attack:</th><td>1-8 (&times;10)</td><td>1-6 (&times;8)</td><td>1-8 (&times;12)</td></tr><tr><th>Special Attacks:</th><td>Constriction</td><td>Constriction</td><td>Constriction</td></tr><tr><th>Special Defenses:</th><td>Air jet</td><td>Air jet</td><td>Air jet</td></tr><tr><th>Magic Resistance:</th><td>Nil</td><td>Nil</td><td>Nil</td></tr><tr><th>Size:</th><td>G (50')</td><td>H (20')</td><td>H (25')</td></tr><tr><th>Morale:</th><td>Average (10)</td><td>Very Steady (12-13)</td><td>Elite (14-15)</td></tr><tr><th>XP Value:</th><td>7,000</td><td>5,000</td><td>9,000</td></tr></table><p class=\"f\">Silt Horror is the name given a group of predators that dwell in the sea of sand. While they vary in size and color, all of them are characterized by a large number of tentacles, and an unending hunger. Few are the creatures that escape once a silt horror has its tentacles around them.</p><h2>White Horror</h2><p class=\"f\">The white horror is the most common, and usually the largest, of the silt horrors. Its tentacles can grow up to 50' long, and it uses them to drag prey below the silt.</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Combat:</b> The white horror lies in wait below the silt. It is very sensitive to the vibrations caused by beings moving through the silt. Because of this, it is very hard to surprise (+2 bonus to surprise rolls). It also lies very still, granting it an increased chance to surprise opponents. (-2 penalty to all opponent's surprise rolls).</p><p>When an opponent gets in range, (50. or less), the white horror attacks with all of its tentacles. It will attack multiple targets, but only if they are all in range. The horror usually attacks as soon as a target gets in range, rather than waiting for a larger group to approach. On an attack roll that exceeds the required score to hit by 4 or more, the victim is held by a tentacle. A hit causes 1d8 points of damage. If the victim is held, he suffers an additional 1d8 each succeeding round. The white horror also tries to drag the victim under the silt. Only creatures with a firm footing or a place to anchor themselves are allowed an Open Doors roll to resist this.</p><p>Once a horror grasps a victim, the tentacle must be severed to allow release. Very strong creatures (Strength 21 or better) have a chance equal to a Bend Bars roll to pull free. Otherwise, each tentacle takes 10 points of damage before being severed. Blunt weapons do half damage, but can eventually crush a tentacle. The white horror does not usually fight to the death.</p><p>On the rare occasions when a horror is losing a fight, it uses its air jet to escape. It moves by jetting out a large gust of air, sliding itself backwards through the silt at a rate of 50 yards per round. This also raises a small cloud of silt, making it almost impossible to follow, at least for those using sight. On the round after fleeing, the horror is completely hidden under the silt, and those who want to finish it off had better be able to fight under the silt. The horror's mouth is located next to the sensitive air sac, and is not used in combat.</p><p>A white horror waits until its food has suffocated before it begins to feed.</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Habitat/Society:</b> The white horror is found anywhere in silt basins and the Sea of Silt. They move very slowly, and usually don't make the effort. They can sense vibrations in the silt up to 3 miles away, and gradually move towards any regular wading path that is used. The white horror does not like the sun, and if it must move out of the silt (to crawl over a sunken wall, for instance) it prefers to wait for dark.</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Ecology:</b> The white horror eats anything except other horrors. It is always hungry, and usually attacks anything that comes in range. It can exist for years on one meal, lying dormant underneath the silt. It lives about 40 years, usually mating only once in its life. This occurs only after a rain, and only if there is a male/female pair in the area. The female waits until she has found a new victim, and lays thousands of eggs in the body. These eventually hatch and jet off through the silt to begin eating. The white horror is said to be good eating by the few <a href=\"/appendix/giantath\">giants</a> who have ever killed one.</p><p>If a horror has tentacles severed, it can replace them at the rate of one per month.</p><h2>Brown Horror</h2><p class=\"f\"><b>Psionics Summary</b></p><table class=\"ip\"><tr class=\"bk\"><th>Level</th><th>Dis/Sci/Dev</th><th>Attack/Defense</th><th>Score</th><th>PSPs</th></tr><tr class=\"cn\"><td>2</td><td>2/2/4</td><td>-/M-</td><td>12</td><td>54</td></tr></table><p class=\"ni\"><b>Clairsentience -</b> <i>Science:</i> precognition; <i>Devotions:</i> feel sound, feel light.</p><p class=\"ni\"><b>Telepathy -</b> <i>Science:</i> domination; <i>Devotions:</i> contact, mind blank.</p><p class=\"f\">The brown horror is a very feared form of silt horror, since it can force its victims to come to it. It is not actually brown, its skin is more of a dirty white color. Against the pearly silt, the tentacles flailing in the air often appear brown.</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Combat:</b> The brown horror lies in wait beneath the silt, like all varieties of silt horror. Its unique features include using precognition to determine the strength of the opposition, and the best time to attack. If it senses that the opponent is too strong for it, it tries to use its domination power to take over the victim. The brown horror is blind and deaf, so it uses its ability to feel sound and light to sense its prey. A brown horror always has at least one tentacle just a fraction below the surface. It uses this &ldquo;sensing tentacle&rdquo; to find out what is going on around it.</p><p>When it attacks, it attempts to grasp an opponent with its tentacles and drag them below the silt. A hit causes 1d6 points of damage, and if it exceeds the attack roll by four or more, the opponent has been grabbed. Grabbing an opponent causes 1d6 points of damage each successive round, and the victim must make a Strength roll or be pulled under the surface. Resisting assumes that the victim has somewhere to get a firm footing, or is anchored to something. Victims pulled under the silt suffocate as listed under the white horror entry. Creatures with a 19 Strength may pull free by making a successful Bend Bars roll, although this is the only action allowed that round. Each tentacle takes 8 points of damage before being destroyed. Tentacle damage does not count towards the total hit points of the creature, although severing 4 or more tentacles causes it to flee, if able. It flees by using its air jet, which is the same as that of the white horror.</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Habitat/Society:</b> The brown horror is a solitary creature, found only in the silt. It is the most active of the horrors, ranging far in search of food. A brown horror lives about 45 years, and must eat at least once a month. Brown horrors are actually the products of cross breeding between the two other types of horrors listed.</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Ecology:</b> The brown horror is always hungry. It even attacks other horrors. It always attempts to dominate other horrors, being smaller and unable to stand up to the larger horrors in physical combat. The brown horror has no natural enemies except the other horrors. It can be eaten, but the few giants who have tried it said that the taste left much to be desired.</p><p>Any severed tentacles take two weeks to grow back, each.</p><h2>Gray Horror</h2><p class=\"f\"><b>Psionics Summary</b></p><table class=\"ip\"><tr class=\"bk\"><th>Level</th><th>Dis/Sci/Dev</th><th>Attack/Defense</th><th>Score</th><th>PSPs</th></tr><tr class=\"cn\"><td>1</td><td>1/0/3</td><td>-/-</td><td>0</td><td>34</td></tr></table><p class=\"ni\"><b>Psychokinesis -</b> <i>Sciences:</i> nil; <i>Devotions:</i> control sound, create sound, control winds.</p><p class=\"f\">The gray horror is perhaps the worst of the silt horrors. It is a sickly gray in color, and has a multitude of sharp-edged tentacles. It is the most intelligent of the horrors, and fears nothing that moves.</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Combat:</b> The gray horror attempts to lure its victim to it. It is skilled at creating and controlling sound. It is not intelligent enough to imitate a person's voice, but it can make whimpering sounds and the sounds of water. It uses its control winds and control sound powers to make it seem that there is water only a few steps away. When the intended victim is close enough, the horror strikes. A full dozen tentacles whip out of the silt and attack. If the victim is really looking for the water, he receives a -4 penalty to his surprise roll, otherwise the horror surprises its victims as listed for the white horror.</p><p>The tentacles are barbed, and a successful hit roll means that the victim is grabbed and held. A hit causes 1d8 points of damage, and the victim is pulled under the silt to suffocate. In addition to the problem of the silt, the horror keeps squeezing, doing 1d8 points of damage each additional round. Only a strength of 23 or better allows a Bend Bars roll attempt to break free. Each tentacle can take 12 points of damage before it is severed. The horror is very protective of its central body, and flees if it takes a direct hit to the body. It moves by jetting itself through the silt, raising a small cloud of silt in the area. It can &ldquo;jet&rdquo; itself up to 50 yards in one round. Unlike the other horrors, this one comes back a few rounds later, at least if the victim(s) do not move off immediately. It will continue these &ldquo;hit and run&rdquo; attacks until it has suffocated as many victims as possible, or until it takes over 50% damage to its body. If one or more tentacles are severed, they regrow at the rate of one per month.</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Habitat/Society:</b> Gray horrors are solitary, hungry, aggressive creatures. They only use their air sacs for emergencies, preferring to &ldquo;swim&rdquo; through the silt. They range far through the silt in search of prey.</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Ecology:</b> Gray horrors consider anything that they can sense as prey. They sense the vibrations of someone moving through or on the silt for up to 3 miles, and usually try to move towards it. Gray horrors mate with any other kind of horrors. Their favorite food is giant, and once a gray horror discovers a giant's path, the giants usually have to find a new path.</p><br clear=\"all\" style=\"clear:both; height:0;\">\r\n","images":["<img src=\"grf/ds.gif\" width=\"150\" height=\"75\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Dark Sun\" title=\"Dark Sun\" align=\"right\">","<img src=\"img/silthorr.gif\" alt=\"Silt Horror\" title=\"Silt Horror\" border=\"0\" width=\"300\" height=\"360\" style=\"text-align:right;\" align=\"right\">","<img src=\"grf/add2_01.gif\" width=\"200\" height=\"56\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Advanced Dungeons & Dragons 2nd Edition\">"],"setting":"Dark Sun","statblock":{"Brown Horror":{"Activity Cycle":"Any","Alignment":"Neutral","Armor Class":"7","Climate/Terrain":"Any Silt","Damage/Attack":"1-6 (&times;8)","Diet":"Carnivore","Frequency":"Very rare","Hit Dice":"9","Intelligence":"Semi- (2-4)","Magic Resistance":"Nil","Morale":"Very Steady (12-13)","Movement":"3","No. Appearing":"1","No. of Attacks":"8","Organization":"Solitary","Size":"H (20')","Special Attacks":"Constriction","Special Defenses":"Air jet","THAC0":"11","Treasure":"Nil","XP Value":"5,000"},"Gray Horror":{"Activity Cycle":"Any","Alignment":"Neutral","Armor Class":"7","Climate/Terrain":"Any Silt","Damage/Attack":"1-8 (&times;12)","Diet":"Carnivore","Frequency":"Rare","Hit Dice":"12","Intelligence":"Semi- (2-4)","Magic Resistance":"Nil","Morale":"Elite (14-15)","Movement":"6","No. Appearing":"1","No. of Attacks":"12","Organization":"Solitary","Size":"H (25')","Special Attacks":"Constriction","Special Defenses":"Air jet","THAC0":"9","Treasure":"Nil","XP Value":"9,000"},"White Horror":{"Activity Cycle":"Any","Alignment":"Neutral","Armor Class":"8","Climate/Terrain":"Any Silt","Damage/Attack":"1-8 (&times;10)","Diet":"Carnivore","Frequency":"Uncommon","Hit Dice":"14","Intelligence":"Animal (1)","Magic Resistance":"Nil","Morale":"Average (10)","Movement":"3","No. Appearing":"1","No. of Attacks":"10","Organization":"Solitary","Size":"G (50')","Special Attacks":"Constriction","Special Defenses":"Air jet","THAC0":"7","Treasure":"Nil","XP Value":"7,000"}},"title":"Silt Horror"},"sources":["2405"],"statblock_names":[],"title":"Silt Horror","prev_key":"silkwyrm","next_key":"siltrunn","monster_path":"/appendix/silthorr"}},"staticQueryHashes":[],"slicesMap":{}}
