While the powers listed above are the most common, some aarakocra have different or additional powers.</p><p class=\"f\">A race of intelligent, birdlike creatures living in the deepest deserts of Athas, the rare Athasian <a href=\"/appendix/aarakocr\">aarakocra</a> spends its time soaring on thermals in search of food.</p><p>The aarakocra is 7 to 8 feet tall with a wingspan of 20 feet or more. Because of its large wingspan, an aarakocra can carry as much as 75% of its own body weight and still fly easily. An aarakocra can fly a short distance carrying a burden equaling 125% of its own body weight. The average body weight of a full grown male is 100 pounds and a female is 85 pounds.</p><p>Each wing has a &ldquo;hand&rdquo; at its midpoint, consisting of three fingers and an opposable thumb. The fourth finger forms the rigid leading edge of the wing. In flight the hands cannot be used, but on the ground the aarakocra can use its hands almost as a human would. The aarakocra's body is protected by a thin bony plate on the chest, much like a solid rib cage. Talons on its legs can be used as claws and can be retracted to reveal a second set of hands, also with three fingers and an opposable thumb. Except for the chest plate, the entire skeleton is hollow and extremely fragile.</p><p>From a distance, the Athasian aarakocra resembles a huge <a href=\"/appendix/bird\">vulture</a>. Its black eyes, set in the front of the head, provide excellent vision over a long range. The plumage is generally black with a white collar for adult males and black or brown with a smaller white collar for females. Adolescents are a mixture of brown and black. The beak is large and covers most of the head. Plumage begins at the crown of the head and is darker near the head, except for the collar. Athasian aarakocra speak their own language and the languages of vultures and other large birds. Some speak the common tongue (5% to 10% chance depending on how deep in the wastelands a tribe lives).</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Combat:</b> Aarakocra can fight in the air or on the ground. They prefer aerial combat since their bones are too fragile to withstand a solid blow from a human-sized opponent. In combat against creatures on the ground, they prefer to fly over their victim and drop weighted nets. Some aarakocra use darts to harass ground-based opponents.</p><p>If their opponents can fly, the aarakocra generally forgo the use of the net, although large groups sometimes use nets on flying creatures. Normally, aarakocra attack flying creatures with long spears, diving from above and allowing the momentum to carry the spear through the target. Such an attack doubles the damage if the aarakocra have been able to dive at least 50 feet. Only the very largest aarakocra can carry more than one of these spears, they can attack with both at once with no penalty, causing double damage on each strike. All diving attacks are made at +4 and should be treated as a charge attack. All other penalties and restrictions of charge attacks apply.</p><p>The effect of the aarakocra's nets depends on if the opponent is flying at the time it becomes entangled. Creatures on the ground that are hit by a net are entangled and unable to participate in any combat until they make a successful Strength check to get free of the net. Flying creatures hit by a net can no longer fly and immediately begin falling. If they cannot escape the net or use some magical means to arrest the fall, normal falling damage applies.</p><p>Unless victims are entangled in nets, aarakocra are cautious in ground combat. If the aarakocra outnumber their opponents they advance in a straight line and thrust with their spears. If outnumbered, or the opponents are particularly tough, the aarakocra withdraw. Victims entangled in nets are killed or incapacitated for use as food or ransom.</p><p>Athasian aarakocra are mindful of their physical limitations as well as their comparatively low psionic abilities. They do not normally initiate psionic combat. At the first sign of psionic powers from any of their victims, however, all aarakocra that have some ability will use whatever attack and defense modes they can in an attempt to destroy the threat. Large groups of is or more aarakocra may initiate psionic combat if their leaders feel they can win quickly and avoid physical combat.</p><p>In desperation, an aarakocra can attempt to bite an opponent in combat. Because of the unwieldiness of its beak, the aarakocra has a THAC0 of 18 if attacking with this appendage. Further, the birdman causes only 1d2 points of damage with the beak.</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Habitat/Society:</b> Athasian aarakocra live in tribes with 6-20 (2d8+4) members, depending on the prestige of the leader. The largest tribe ever recorded had 50 members. The tribal hunting territory depends on the size of the tribe, usually about 500 square miles for a tribe of 10 members. There are no rigid boundaries between tribes and border disputes are not uncommon.</p><p>Alignments of tribe members are similar to the alignment of the leader. A tribe that has a leader who is neutral good may have neutral good, chaotic good, lawful good, and true neutral members. A predominantly evil tribe does not recognize boundaries with other tribes and treats other tribes as inferior beings to be eliminated.</p><p>Athasian aarakocra aren't happy in enclosed spaces, but they they take refuge in a cave or building if necessary.</p><p>Nonevil tribes live in rocky aeries in the highest peaks they can find. Evil tribes are normally nomadic and use an aerie made by another tribe if they need to remain in an area for a long time, even if they have to evict the tribe that made the nest.</p><p>Aarakocra aren't friendly toward intruders in their territory, especially caravans. They try to extract a toll from the caravan for passage through the desert. Good-aligned tribes allow unhindered passage of caravans that pay a tribute. If someone refuses to pay the tribute, the aarakocra try to capture scouts or outriders from the party and hold them until an even larger tribute is paid. The payment may be either livestock or shiny objects. Aarakocra are smart enough not to be taken in by glass baubles instead of gems, although they cannot tell the difference between the more common gems and the rare ones.</p><p>Evil tribes ask for tribute and often attack a caravan whether it pays or not. Aarakocra always demand shiny objects such as stones. These tribes find humans and demihumans to be quite tasty and prefer them to other food.</p><p>Good-aligned tribes of aarakocra sometimes return a lost traveler to the edge of the desert after first removing any valuables the traveler may be carrying. On very rare occasions a tribe might return a lost group of travelers to the more frequently traveled parts of the desert, again after first taking any valuables as payment.</p><p>The oldest male is the leader of the tribal hunting party and has 4+4 Hit Dice. The oldest female is in charge of the tribal aerie and has 3+3 HD. In tribes that have more than 15 members, the next oldest aarakocra serves as shaman and has 3+3 HD; the shaman completes the triumvirate necessary for proper worship and the summoning of elementals. (Interestingly, no magic-using aarakocra has ever been recorded.) Tribes without a shaman cannot summon <a href=\"/appendix/element1\">air elementals</a>, which is an important part of aarakocra culture.</p><p>The shaman is the leader of the daily sun worship. Aarakocra worship the sun because it provides them with the thermals they need to soar in search of food. The shaman also leads the mystic rituals used to summon an air elemental. Summoning an air elemental is usually done only in preparation for the tribe's most sacred ceremony, the hunt. Small tribes must band together for this ceremony to allow the triumvirate to be formed.</p><p>The ceremony to summon an air elemental must be conducted at dawn and requires the oldest male and female to emit a highpitched keening whistle. The shaman conducts an intricate dance around them, simultaneously chanting an ancient summoning mantra.</p><p>The hunt is the final part of the initiation of adolescent aarakocra to adulthood and often takes the tribe far from their normal teritory. The target is always a <a href=\"/appendix/drakalsi\">silt drake</a>. The hunt is the only time the females leave the relative safety of the nest. Even an evil tribe will not interfere with a tribe on a hunt. An air elemental is often summoned to help find the drake, but never takes part in the actual combat. Although the adult members of the tribe take part in the initial phases of the combat, it is the initiates who deliver the final, killing blows to me drake. Scars from the hunt are considered a mark of pride among all aarakocra.</p><p>The females spend about eight months of the year incubating their eggs. Athasian aarakocra mate for life and a pair normally produces as many as 10 offspring. A female lays one egg a year. Constant incubation is not required because of the high daytime temperatures, so the females can maintain the nest and keep the tribe's treasure in order.</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Ecology:</b> Athasian aarakocra are high on the food chain and have no natural enemies other than <a href=\"/appendix/drakatha\">drakes</a>. Unless evil, aarakocra leave their own territory only to hunt the silt drake and return as soon as possible when the hunt is over. (Evil aarakocra attack others, as noted above.) Aarakocra eggs and hatchlings are sought after by wealthy land owners who wish to use the creatures as scouts and sentries. An egg can bring as much as 10 cp in Tyr's marketplace. Tribes that have had eggs or hatchlings stolen have long memories and sometimes take revenge against the thief at a later date. Captive aarakocra join any tribe they come in contact with.</p><p>Athasian aarakocra have a natural life span of 21-30 years.</p>\n","images":["<img src=\"grf/ds.gif\" width=\"150\" height=\"75\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Dark Sun\" title=\"Dark Sun\" align=\"right\">","<img src=\"img/aarakath.gif\" alt=\"Aarakocra (Athas)\" title=\"Aarakocra (Athas)\" border=\"0\" width=\"300\" height=\"360\" style=\"text-align:right;\" align=\"right\">","<img src=\"grf/add2_01.gif\" width=\"200\" height=\"56\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Advanced Dungeons & Dragons 2nd Edition\">"],"setting":"Dark Sun","statblock":{"Aarakocra (Athas)":{"Activity Cycle":"Day","Alignment":"Any","Armor Class":"7","Climate/Terrain":"Deep desert","Damage/Attack":"1d3/1d3 or by weapon","Diet":"Carnivore","Frequency":"Rare","Hit Dice":"2+2","Intelligence":"Average (8-10)","Magic Resistance":"Nil","Morale":"Steady (11)","Movement":"6, Fl 36 (C)","No. Appearing":"1d10","No. of Attacks":"2","Organization":"Tribal","Size":"M (20'+ wingspan)","Special Attacks":"Nil","Special Defenses":"Nil","THAC0":"17","Treasure":"Varies","XP Value":"65"}},"title":"Aarakocra (Athas)"},"sources":["2433"],"statblock_names":[],"title":"Aarakocra (Athas)","prev_key":"zygraat","next_key":"aarakocr","monster_path":"/appendix/aarakath"}}},"pageContext":{"monster_key":"hamsgisp","monster_data":{"TSR":["2109"],"fullBody":"  <table cellspacing=\"0\" cellpadding=\"0\"><tr><th>Climate/Terrain:</th><td>Temperate/Grassy plains and hills</td></tr><tr><th>Frequency:</th><td>Common to very rare</td></tr><tr><th>Organization:</th><td>Small pack</td></tr><tr><th>Activity Cycle:</th><td>Night</td></tr><tr><th>Diet:</th><td>Omnivore</td></tr><tr><th>Intelligence:</th><td>Animal (1)</td></tr><tr><th>Treasure:</th><td>Nil</td></tr><tr><th>Alignment:</th><td>Neutral</td></tr><tr><th>No. Appearing:</th><td>See below</td></tr><tr><th>Armor Class:</th><td>8</td></tr><tr><th>Movement:</th><td>9, Br 3 (hard earth)</td></tr><tr><th>Hit Dice:</th><td>4</td></tr><tr><th>THAC0:</th><td>17</td></tr><tr><th>No. of Attacks:</th><td>1</td></tr><tr><th>Damage/Attack:</th><td>2-8</td></tr><tr><th>Special Attacks:</th><td>Nil</td></tr><tr><th>Special Defenses:</th><td>Immune to disease</td></tr><tr><th>Magic Resistance:</th><td>Nil</td></tr><tr><th>Size:</th><td>L (up to 9' long)</td></tr><tr><th>Morale:</th><td>Unsteady (6) (if wild: Average (9))</td></tr><tr><th>XP Value:</th><td>175</td></tr></table><p class=\"f\">Giant space hamsters are exactly what they sound like-cute but brown-bear-sized rodents with thick fur. They are found on worlds having colonies of Krynnish <a href=\"/appendix/gnome\">gnomes</a> (gnomoi and <a href=\"/appendix/gnomtink\">minoi</a>). Giant space hamsters come in a variety of colors, but are usually golden brown with white underbellies, bands, and spots. They are well muscled but appear fat. A giant space hamster can store up to 200 lbs. of food in its cheeks.</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Combat:</b> Giant space hamsters normally have only one mode of attack - a nasty bite. They avoid even this on most occasions, as domestic breeds are quite cowardly. However, wild breeds are more aggressive, and they briefly charge at anyone who approaches a burrow. Domesticated females profiting their litters also have improved morale (9). Careless gnome handlers have sometimes been bitten and (on a successful attack roll of 19 or better) stuffed into a cheek pouch, from which the gnome may escape if he rolls a successful Strength roll to open doors on a subsequent round. Trapped gnomes are merely covered in hamster spit, and are eventually spat out like old chewing gum when the hamster sees food.</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Habitat/Society:</b> A small pack of giant space hamsters consists of 1d4 adults (select the sexes by starting with a female and alienating thereafter, so a pack of three hamsters consists of two females and a male), with a 20% chance per adult female of 1d4 young being present (AC 10, MV 3, HD 1, #AT nil, Size S 3' long) and another 20% chance per adult female of 1d4 juvenile being present (AC 9, MV 6, HD 2, THAC0 19, #AT 1, Dmg 1d4, Size M 6' long). Gnomes are unable to figure out how to reduce their breeding rate, aside from seperating the sexes (this conclusion was suggested after a 22-year-long research program that included five gnome fatalities). Giant space hamsters can easily have several litters in one year, and they grow to breeding adulthood in but two years. These creatures live 18 years at most, and remain fertile all their adult lives.</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Ecology:</b> Giant space hamster easily fill the niche ocupied by large browsing animals, such as the <a href=\"/appendix/elephant\">elephant</a> and the rhino on Earth, though most of them lack any real means of defending themselves. In the wild, they often die out despite their extraordinary reproductive rate. They are preyed upon by large- and medium-size carnivores, but they are immune to all parasites and diseases, magical or not. Cold weather forces them to hibernate for up to six months until the weather improves.</p><p>These creatures did not evolve naturally, as one might guess. They were created by a gnome research committee attempting to develop a relatively passive creature large enough to wind up the giant rubber bands attached to the huge running wheels inside gnomish spelljammer craft. These devices produce internal power from torque. (Teams of gnomes formerly filled this job.) The giant space hamsters produced by the committee ran for hours inside their big wheels, and were eventually spread through space.</p><p>Gnomes have found that the meat of giant space hamsters is quite tasty. Space hamster meat is called &ldquo;spaham&rdquo;, and many gnomes eat large quantities of spaham with every meal. Many hamster ranches simply breed giant space hamsters as livestock.</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Variations</b></p><p class=\"f\">Possibly the worst aspect of the giant space hamster (aside from its ludicrous existence) is that enchanted substances from numerous other sorts of nonhuman monsters can be introduced into its reproductive processes, producing unbelievable (except to a gnome) new sorts of giant space hamsters. Some gnomish communities deliberately breed unique subspecies in competition with other communities to produce the most interesting varieties. Usually, the results are more or less like the normal sort of giant space hamster, such as the wooly, mottled, ochre. Oriental, Occidental, chartreuse, spotted, not-quite-so-spotted, only-a-littlespotted, plaid, cave-dwelling, three-toed, lesser, greater, greater lesser, lesser greater, albino, and flightless giant space hamsters. And then there are the really unusual varieties: such as the following:</p><p>* <i>Subterranean Giant Space Hamster</i>: This creature can dig through any material up to soft rock at MV 6; it attacks with its claws for 4d4/4d4. </p><p>* <i>Sabre-toothed Giant Space Hamster</i>: A nasty overbite lets this hamster attack for 2d8 points of damage with fangs (but it is still omnivorous). </p><p>* <i>Rather Wild Giant Space Hamster</i>: When confronted by nonhamsters, this one gains a morale of 19 and a +2 bonus to attack and damage rolls. </p><p>* <i>Invisible Giant Space Hamster</i>: This one can turn invisible at will once per day for 1d4 +4 turns, remaining invisible even if it attacks. </p><p>* <i>Sylvan or Jungle Giant Space Hamster</i>: This hamster can climb at MV 9 up any nonslick surface with a 99% chance of success. </p><p>* <i>Miniature Giant Space Hamster</i>: Being the same size as normal hamster (AC 10, MV 1, hp 1, etc.), this creature is often kept as a pet. </p><p>* <i>Armor Plated Giant Space Hamster</i>: Fur less and covered by a rhino-like hide (AC 3), this very aggressive (morale 16) critter is a hazard. </p><p>* <i>Yellow Musk Giant Space Hamster</i>: This yellow-furred hamster has a terrible odor. It emits a 30-foot-radius cloud of poisonous gas causing nausea (MV 3), blindness (-4 penalty to attack rolls), and weakness (reduce Strength by four levels) in anyone failing a saving throw vs. poison. </p><p>* <i>Ethereal Giant Space Hamster</i>: Not really ethereal, this one is translucent and its skeleton can be seen. The first sight of this beast produces fright, as per a scare spell. </p><p>* <i>Carnivorous Flying Giant Space Hamster</i>: A \"regrettable if understandable line of inquiry\" led to this bat-winged version (MV 9, Fl 24 (8); bites for 3d4 points of damage, two claws for 2d4 points of damage; Morale 15). </p><p>* <i>Two-Headed Lernaean Bombardier Giant Space Hamster</i>: \"Well, we're certainly not likely to make this mistake again or al least not more than once again anyway: Each head can make a normal biting attack, it regenerates wounds at 3 hit points per round (but cannot regenerate lost body parts), and once per day it can belch so loudly that anyone within 30 feet must roll a successful saving throw vs. breath weapon or be stunned (unable to attack, defend, or move) for l d4 + I rounds. </p><p>* <i>Fire-Breathing Phase Doppleganger Giant Space Hamster</i>: \"We completely fail to see why everyone is so upset, especially since biology is such an inexact science and for every step we take forward there must be two steps backward but anyway we said we were sorry and we'd like our funding back so we can pay our bail and go home:' This monster breathes a 30-foot-long cone of fire that is ten feet wide at its far end, three times per day for 3d8 points of damage (successful saving throw vs. dragon breath for half damage). The FBPDGSH suffers only half damage from fiery attacks. This species can also phase in and out of the Prime Material plane within a single round, just like a phase spider; it can do this up to six times per day with a -3 modifier to initiative. If this creature gains initiative by more than 4 points, it can breathe fire or bite, then phase out before being attacked. It can be attacked every round on the Ethereal plane with only a -1 modifier to its initiative. lt can also change its shape in one round to appear to be any other sort of bear-sized mammal. Worst of all, it is intelligent (5-7) and has a morale of 14, and it quickly learns how best to use its talents. </p><p>* <i>Great Horned Giant Space Hamster</i>: This one has a rhino-like horn on its nose, with which it inflicts 1d12 points of damage if charging more than 30 feet. </p><p>* <i>Abominable Giant Space Hamster</i>: An albino version adapted to arctic weather, this one feeds on conifers. It suffers only half damage from cold-based magic and no damage from nonmagical cold. </p><p>* <i>Tyrannohamsterus Rex</i>: This immense space hamster has absolutely no attacks whatsoever, unless it runs in fright and steps on someone (AC 2; MV 9; HD 16; THAC0 5; #AT 2; Dmg 10d10; MR 90%; Size 25' high at shoulder. weighs 75 tons; Morale 3). Any display of magic, fire, bright light, loud noise, etc., frightens this beast, which then crashes through all terrain features for 1d4 miles in its panic to escape, The now-defunct gnome colony that first bred this species did so \"because it was there.\" </p><p>* <i>Giant Space Hamster of Ill Omen</i>: This possibly legendary creature is an individual rumored to be of unusual size, even larger than a Tyrannohamsterus Rex. \"Wooly Rupert\" (as he is known among gnomes) is also said to be highly intelligent and to possess spellcasting and spelljamming powers. Tales say he is not well disposed toward gnomes of any sort, preferring to squash them with his titanic paws. Gnomes everywhere fear the wrath of Wooly Rupert, though they laugh nervously and claim otherwise. Experience-point values for these and similar sorts of giant space hamsters should be awarded by the DM as he feels fit.</p><p>Experience-point values for these and similar sorts of giant space hamsters should be awarded by the OM as he feels fit.</p><img src=\"/img/spc/hamsgisp1.gif\" alt=\"A Giant Space Hamster and a Fire-Breathing Giant Space Hamster look at a regular sized hamster held in a hand.\"/>\n","images":["<img src=\"grf/sj.gif\" width=\"150\" height=\"75\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Spelljammer\" title=\"Spelljammer\" align=\"right\">","<img src=\"img/hamsgisp.gif\" alt=\"Hamster, Giant Space\" title=\"Hamster, Giant Space\" border=\"0\" width=\"300\" height=\"360\" style=\"text-align:right;\" align=\"right\">","<img src=\"/img/spc/hamsgisp1.gif\" alt=\"A Giant Space Hamster and a Fire-Breathing Giant Space Hamster look at a regular sized hamster held in a hand.\"/>","<img src=\"grf/add2_01.gif\" width=\"200\" height=\"56\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Advanced Dungeons & Dragons 2nd Edition\">"],"setting":"Spelljammer","statblock":{"Hamster, Giant Space":{"Activity Cycle":"Night","Alignment":"Neutral","Armor Class":"8","Climate/Terrain":"Temperate/Grassy plains and hills","Damage/Attack":"2-8","Diet":"Omnivore","Frequency":"Common to very rare","Hit Dice":"4","Intelligence":"Animal (1)","Magic Resistance":"Nil","Morale":"Unsteady (6) (if wild: Average (9))","Movement":"9, Br 3 (hard earth)","No. Appearing":"See below","No. of Attacks":"1","Organization":"Small pack","Size":"L (up to 9' long)","Special Attacks":"Nil","Special Defenses":"Immune to disease","THAC0":"17","Treasure":"Nil","XP Value":"175"}},"title":"Hamster, Giant Space"},"sources":["2109"],"statblock_names":[],"title":"Hamster, Giant Space","prev_key":"hamadrya","next_key":"hand","monster_path":"/appendix/hamsgisp"}},"staticQueryHashes":[],"slicesMap":{}}
