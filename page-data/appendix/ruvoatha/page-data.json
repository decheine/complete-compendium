They travel the planes easily, even the Astral Plane, but on Athas they are bound to certain locations. They often work with druids. It is said druids who reach 18th-level or higher can become ruvoka. Ruvoka have their own language, but with other intelligent beings use a limited form of telepathy.</p><p>The four best known ruvoka are the brajeti, ethilum, kaltori, and zathosi. Brajeti resemble large, well-tanned, hairless humans who dress in bronze armor and carry bronze swords and shields. Ethilum resemble large, pale blue, elflike beings with white feathered wings and long, flowing hair, wearing only white clothing and armed with whips and javelins. Kaltori are bearded, red-skinned, stocky, human-looking beings wearing searing hot plate armor and bearing fiery red tridents. Zathosi are large, gray-skinned, wrinkled humanlike creatures resembling old men. Zathosi wear stone-colored robes and carry mauls of stone.</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Combat:</b> Brajeti attack with their swords. Ethilum attack with their javelins or whips.
