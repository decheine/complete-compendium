While the powers listed above are the most common, some aarakocra have different or additional powers.</p><p class=\"f\">A race of intelligent, birdlike creatures living in the deepest deserts of Athas, the rare Athasian <a href=\"/appendix/aarakocr\">aarakocra</a> spends its time soaring on thermals in search of food.</p><p>The aarakocra is 7 to 8 feet tall with a wingspan of 20 feet or more. Because of its large wingspan, an aarakocra can carry as much as 75% of its own body weight and still fly easily. An aarakocra can fly a short distance carrying a burden equaling 125% of its own body weight. The average body weight of a full grown male is 100 pounds and a female is 85 pounds.</p><p>Each wing has a &ldquo;hand&rdquo; at its midpoint, consisting of three fingers and an opposable thumb. The fourth finger forms the rigid leading edge of the wing. In flight the hands cannot be used, but on the ground the aarakocra can use its hands almost as a human would. The aarakocra's body is protected by a thin bony plate on the chest, much like a solid rib cage. Talons on its legs can be used as claws and can be retracted to reveal a second set of hands, also with three fingers and an opposable thumb. Except for the chest plate, the entire skeleton is hollow and extremely fragile.</p><p>From a distance, the Athasian aarakocra resembles a huge <a href=\"/appendix/bird\">vulture</a>. Its black eyes, set in the front of the head, provide excellent vision over a long range. The plumage is generally black with a white collar for adult males and black or brown with a smaller white collar for females. Adolescents are a mixture of brown and black. The beak is large and covers most of the head. Plumage begins at the crown of the head and is darker near the head, except for the collar. Athasian aarakocra speak their own language and the languages of vultures and other large birds. Some speak the common tongue (5% to 10% chance depending on how deep in the wastelands a tribe lives).</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Combat:</b> Aarakocra can fight in the air or on the ground. They prefer aerial combat since their bones are too fragile to withstand a solid blow from a human-sized opponent. In combat against creatures on the ground, they prefer to fly over their victim and drop weighted nets. Some aarakocra use darts to harass ground-based opponents.</p><p>If their opponents can fly, the aarakocra generally forgo the use of the net, although large groups sometimes use nets on flying creatures. Normally, aarakocra attack flying creatures with long spears, diving from above and allowing the momentum to carry the spear through the target. Such an attack doubles the damage if the aarakocra have been able to dive at least 50 feet. Only the very largest aarakocra can carry more than one of these spears, they can attack with both at once with no penalty, causing double damage on each strike. All diving attacks are made at +4 and should be treated as a charge attack. All other penalties and restrictions of charge attacks apply.</p><p>The effect of the aarakocra's nets depends on if the opponent is flying at the time it becomes entangled. Creatures on the ground that are hit by a net are entangled and unable to participate in any combat until they make a successful Strength check to get free of the net. Flying creatures hit by a net can no longer fly and immediately begin falling. If they cannot escape the net or use some magical means to arrest the fall, normal falling damage applies.</p><p>Unless victims are entangled in nets, aarakocra are cautious in ground combat. If the aarakocra outnumber their opponents they advance in a straight line and thrust with their spears. If outnumbered, or the opponents are particularly tough, the aarakocra withdraw. Victims entangled in nets are killed or incapacitated for use as food or ransom.</p><p>Athasian aarakocra are mindful of their physical limitations as well as their comparatively low psionic abilities. They do not normally initiate psionic combat. At the first sign of psionic powers from any of their victims, however, all aarakocra that have some ability will use whatever attack and defense modes they can in an attempt to destroy the threat. Large groups of is or more aarakocra may initiate psionic combat if their leaders feel they can win quickly and avoid physical combat.</p><p>In desperation, an aarakocra can attempt to bite an opponent in combat. Because of the unwieldiness of its beak, the aarakocra has a THAC0 of 18 if attacking with this appendage. Further, the birdman causes only 1d2 points of damage with the beak.</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Habitat/Society:</b> Athasian aarakocra live in tribes with 6-20 (2d8+4) members, depending on the prestige of the leader. The largest tribe ever recorded had 50 members. The tribal hunting territory depends on the size of the tribe, usually about 500 square miles for a tribe of 10 members. There are no rigid boundaries between tribes and border disputes are not uncommon.</p><p>Alignments of tribe members are similar to the alignment of the leader. A tribe that has a leader who is neutral good may have neutral good, chaotic good, lawful good, and true neutral members. A predominantly evil tribe does not recognize boundaries with other tribes and treats other tribes as inferior beings to be eliminated.</p><p>Athasian aarakocra aren't happy in enclosed spaces, but they they take refuge in a cave or building if necessary.</p><p>Nonevil tribes live in rocky aeries in the highest peaks they can find. Evil tribes are normally nomadic and use an aerie made by another tribe if they need to remain in an area for a long time, even if they have to evict the tribe that made the nest.</p><p>Aarakocra aren't friendly toward intruders in their territory, especially caravans. They try to extract a toll from the caravan for passage through the desert. Good-aligned tribes allow unhindered passage of caravans that pay a tribute. If someone refuses to pay the tribute, the aarakocra try to capture scouts or outriders from the party and hold them until an even larger tribute is paid. The payment may be either livestock or shiny objects. Aarakocra are smart enough not to be taken in by glass baubles instead of gems, although they cannot tell the difference between the more common gems and the rare ones.</p><p>Evil tribes ask for tribute and often attack a caravan whether it pays or not. Aarakocra always demand shiny objects such as stones. These tribes find humans and demihumans to be quite tasty and prefer them to other food.</p><p>Good-aligned tribes of aarakocra sometimes return a lost traveler to the edge of the desert after first removing any valuables the traveler may be carrying. On very rare occasions a tribe might return a lost group of travelers to the more frequently traveled parts of the desert, again after first taking any valuables as payment.</p><p>The oldest male is the leader of the tribal hunting party and has 4+4 Hit Dice. The oldest female is in charge of the tribal aerie and has 3+3 HD. In tribes that have more than 15 members, the next oldest aarakocra serves as shaman and has 3+3 HD; the shaman completes the triumvirate necessary for proper worship and the summoning of elementals. (Interestingly, no magic-using aarakocra has ever been recorded.) Tribes without a shaman cannot summon <a href=\"/appendix/element1\">air elementals</a>, which is an important part of aarakocra culture.</p><p>The shaman is the leader of the daily sun worship. Aarakocra worship the sun because it provides them with the thermals they need to soar in search of food. The shaman also leads the mystic rituals used to summon an air elemental. Summoning an air elemental is usually done only in preparation for the tribe's most sacred ceremony, the hunt. Small tribes must band together for this ceremony to allow the triumvirate to be formed.</p><p>The ceremony to summon an air elemental must be conducted at dawn and requires the oldest male and female to emit a highpitched keening whistle. The shaman conducts an intricate dance around them, simultaneously chanting an ancient summoning mantra.</p><p>The hunt is the final part of the initiation of adolescent aarakocra to adulthood and often takes the tribe far from their normal teritory. The target is always a <a href=\"/appendix/drakalsi\">silt drake</a>. The hunt is the only time the females leave the relative safety of the nest. Even an evil tribe will not interfere with a tribe on a hunt. An air elemental is often summoned to help find the drake, but never takes part in the actual combat. Although the adult members of the tribe take part in the initial phases of the combat, it is the initiates who deliver the final, killing blows to me drake. Scars from the hunt are considered a mark of pride among all aarakocra.</p><p>The females spend about eight months of the year incubating their eggs. Athasian aarakocra mate for life and a pair normally produces as many as 10 offspring. A female lays one egg a year. Constant incubation is not required because of the high daytime temperatures, so the females can maintain the nest and keep the tribe's treasure in order.</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Ecology:</b> Athasian aarakocra are high on the food chain and have no natural enemies other than <a href=\"/appendix/drakatha\">drakes</a>. Unless evil, aarakocra leave their own territory only to hunt the silt drake and return as soon as possible when the hunt is over. (Evil aarakocra attack others, as noted above.) Aarakocra eggs and hatchlings are sought after by wealthy land owners who wish to use the creatures as scouts and sentries. An egg can bring as much as 10 cp in Tyr's marketplace. Tribes that have had eggs or hatchlings stolen have long memories and sometimes take revenge against the thief at a later date. Captive aarakocra join any tribe they come in contact with.</p><p>Athasian aarakocra have a natural life span of 21-30 years.</p>\n","images":["<img src=\"grf/ds.gif\" width=\"150\" height=\"75\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Dark Sun\" title=\"Dark Sun\" align=\"right\">","<img src=\"img/aarakath.gif\" alt=\"Aarakocra (Athas)\" title=\"Aarakocra (Athas)\" border=\"0\" width=\"300\" height=\"360\" style=\"text-align:right;\" align=\"right\">","<img src=\"grf/add2_01.gif\" width=\"200\" height=\"56\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Advanced Dungeons & Dragons 2nd Edition\">"],"setting":"Dark Sun","statblock":{"Aarakocra (Athas)":{"Activity Cycle":"Day","Alignment":"Any","Armor Class":"7","Climate/Terrain":"Deep desert","Damage/Attack":"1d3/1d3 or by weapon","Diet":"Carnivore","Frequency":"Rare","Hit Dice":"2+2","Intelligence":"Average (8-10)","Magic Resistance":"Nil","Morale":"Steady (11)","Movement":"6, Fl 36 (C)","No. Appearing":"1d10","No. of Attacks":"2","Organization":"Tribal","Size":"M (20'+ wingspan)","Special Attacks":"Nil","Special Defenses":"Nil","THAC0":"17","Treasure":"Varies","XP Value":"65"}},"title":"Aarakocra (Athas)"},"sources":["2433"],"statblock_names":[],"title":"Aarakocra (Athas)","prev_key":"zygraat","next_key":"aarakocr","monster_path":"/appendix/aarakath"}}},"pageContext":{"monster_key":"specmini","monster_data":{"TSR":["2105"],"fullBody":"  <table cellspacing=\"0\" cellpadding=\"0\"><tr><th>Climate/Terrain:</th><td>Any</td></tr><tr><th>Frequency:</th><td>Very rare</td></tr><tr><th>Organization:</th><td>Varies</td></tr><tr><th>Activity Cycle:</th><td>Any</td></tr><tr><th>Diet:</th><td>Nil</td></tr><tr><th>Intelligence:</th><td>Average (8-10)</td></tr><tr><th>Treasure:</th><td>Nil</td></tr><tr><th>Alignment:</th><td>Varies</td></tr><tr><th>No. Appearing:</th><td>1-20 or more</td></tr><tr><th>Armor Class:</th><td>2</td></tr><tr><th>Movement:</th><td>30</td></tr><tr><th>Hit Dice:</th><td>Varies</td></tr><tr><th>THAC0:</th><td>Varies</td></tr><tr><th>No. of Attacks:</th><td>0, 1, or 2</td></tr><tr><th>Damage/Attack:</th><td>Varies</td></tr><tr><th>Special Attacks:</th><td>See below</td></tr><tr><th>Special Defenses:</th><td>+1 or better to hit</td></tr><tr><th>Magic Resistance:</th><td>20%</td></tr><tr><th>Size:</th><td>M (5-7' tall)</td></tr><tr><th>Morale:</th><td>Elite (13)</td></tr><tr><th>XP Value:</th><td>Philosopher: 975<br>Reveler: 975<br>Searcher: 975<br>Guardian: 1,400<br>Warrior: 1,400<br>Berserker: 1,400</td></tr></table><p class=\"f\">Spectral minions are the spirits of humans or demihumans who died before they could fulfill their vows. Even in death, spectral minions are bound to the vows or quests placed upon them while they were alive.</p><p>Spectral minions appear as they were in life, except that they are nearly transparent. Like <a href=\"/appendix/ghost\">ghosts</a>, spectral minions do not fully exist on the Prime Material plane. Spectral minions retain the Hit Dice, attack, damage ratings, alignment, and language of their former selves. Regardless of their intelligence in their previous lives, all spectral minions are average intelligence. They retain some but not necessarily all of the memories of their original forms, as spectral minions, their uncompleted quests and vows dominate their minds. All spectral minions have a movement rate of 30.</p><p>There are six general types of spectral minions: berserkers, guardians, philosophers, revelers, searchers, and warriors. The types cannot be distinguished by appearance, but their attitudes and behavior are quite different, as detailed in the description of each type.</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Combat:</b> Spectral minions can inflict damage only if they died holding weapons. Such weapons become a part of their spectral forms. Long swords are the most typical, but daggers, bows, staves, and other melee weapons are also common. These weapons inflict the same amount of damage as they would if wielded by living creatures. Since their weapons are part of them, spectral minions cannot be disarmed.</p><p>The speed of spectral minions gives them a -1 bonus to all initiative rolls. They can be hit only by +1 or better weapons. Though spectral minions cannot use magic themselves, they are 20% magic resistant.</p><p>If a spectral minion is destroyed, or if its vows or quests are fulfilled, the spectral minion (and its weapon) disappears forever. This also occurs if <i>remove curse</i> or a similar spell is cast upon it. A spectral minion cannot be turned.</p><p>Certain types of spectral minions have special attacks. These are explained in the individual listings.</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Habitat/Society:</b> Spectral minions are cursed to relive the events leading to their death, endlessly trying to fulfill their vows. Outdoors, they must stay within 1,000 yards of where they died. Indoors, they must stay in the corridor or room where they lost their lives. On very rare occasions where a quest required them to perform an act over a wide area, they are tree to roam within that area.</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Ecology:</b> Spectral minions do not age, nor do they perform any physiological functions; though they may appear to be eating or drinking, these actions have no meaningful effects.</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Berserkers</b></p>  <p class=\"ni\">Some spectral minions become overwhelmed by despair. Losing all hope of ever being freed from their charge, these minions are eventually driven into a berkserking frenzy. Others become mindless killers as soon as they become minions because of an unresolved obsession in their former lives; for instance, a spectral minion cook might become a berserker because someone in the past criticized his cooking and was no longer around to apologize for the remark.</p><p>All berserker spectral minions are of chaotic evi1 alignment. They fanatically attack any intruders who stumble into their territory. They refuse to parley and pursue intruders as far as possible. All berserker spectral minions are armed and gain a +1 bonus to their attack and damage rolls. Additionally, berserkers can make two attacks per round, they are the only spectral minions with this ability.</p><p>In all cases, berserker spectral minions have rebelled against their quests and have no hope of ever being freed from their charges. Even if a sympathetic character is able to discover the nature of a berserker minion's unfulfilled quest, resolving it will not cause the spectral minion to disappear; in the case of the spectral minion cook, finding the poor soul who insulted him in his former life and forcing him to apologize will not cause the minion to vanish. Berserker spectral minions can only be vanquished if they are destroyed or if <i>remove curse</i> or a similar spell is cast upon them.</p><p></p><p class=\"f\"><b>Guardians</b></p><p class=\"ni\">These spectral minions were quested to defend a room, a passage, or an object. In most cases, they served as guards for some important location and died at their posts.</p><p>Guardian spectral minions are freed from their confinement it they successfully defend their posts against intruders for 100 years and a day, or complete some other assigned task.</p><p>Occasionally, guardians respond to a password or signal, allowing characters to pass safely.</p><p>All guardians are armed and are usually of chaotic or neutral good alignment. They defend themselves if attacked or if their post is threatened, but otherwise they are not particularly hostile. More than anything, guardian spectral minions want to be released from their vows and to be freed of their responsibilities.</p><p>The following are some examples of guardian spectral minions:</p><ul><li>A guardian is assigned to watch over the coffins of a royal family in a sealed tomb. He is so weary of his eternal duty that he speaks openly to any intruders who treat him kindly. If an intruder tells him that he is relieved of his duty - regardless of whether the intruder has any actual authority to do so - the guardian is released from his vow and disappears.</li><li>A guardian floats above a large golden chair in an otherwise empty room. It is his responsibility to guard the chair from intruders. If an intruder speaks the password &ldquo;persevere&rdquo;, the minion is released from his vows and free of his responsibilities. Characters can pass through the room unharmed, so long as they do not approach the chair. If an intruder does not speak the password, the guardian attacks until the intruder leaves. The guardian is released from his vows after he has guarded the chair for 100 years and a day.</li><li>A guardian sits behind a marble counter in a dusty room. He is required to collect a visitor's tax from all intruders. If the intruder pays the tax, the guardian allows him to pass; if not, the guardian attacks him. When the guardian has spent 100 years and a day collecting taxes, he is released from his vows.</li></ul><p class=\"f\"><b>Philosophers</b></p>  <p class=\"ni\">Philosophers are spectral minions who spend their time in study and contemplation, usually in libraries or museums. They are extremely knowledgeable. If given the chance, they talk at great length about subjects that interest them.</p><p>Philosophers can be of any alignment. Often they arc found in groups of two or more engaged in heated debate; it is their curse to endlessly discuss philosophic issues left unresolved in their former lives. Philosophers usually do not tolerate interruptions, but they have been known to ask intruders for their opinions about an issue under discussion. They attack only if their honesty is questioned or if they have to defend themselves.</p><p>A party may sometimes encounter a group of spectral minions hovering off the ground about 1d4+1 feet. These are philosopher minions lost deep in thought. The floating philosophers often invite questions from an intruder. With each response, the philosophers drop a foot closer to the ground. If the philosophers reach the ground, they become enraged that the intruder has asked too many questions, then summon help, usually 1d8 warrior minions from an adjacent area.</p><p>Similarly, a group of philosophers may be encountered floating several feet off the ground while involved in an animated discussion. They, too, invite questions from an intruder. However, when one philosopher has given his response, one of the others totally disagrees, triggering a pointless argument that continues for 1d6 rounds with half of the minions taking one side and half taking the other. As before, the minions drop a foot closer to the ground with each response, but in this case, the entire group disappears as soon as one of them touches the ground.</p><p></p><p class=\"f\"><b>Revelers</b></p><p class=\"ni\">These minions are cursed to celebrate madly for all eternity. When encountered, they are engaged in one of the following activities:</p><ul><li>Frenzied dancing</li><li>Drinking spectral ale or wine</li><li>Chasing members of the opposite sex</li><li>Playing musical instruments</li><li>Dining gluttonously</li></ul><p>Reveler spectral minions arc chaotic evil. Though unarmed, they can be quite dangerous. Any character seen by the revelers may be surrounded by them, if they're looking for more guests for their party (as determined by the DM). The revelers beckon to the character, laughing and shrieking, urging him to join their fun. If the character joins the revelers for at least three consecutive rounds, he must roll a successful saving throw vs. spell to resist them. It the character successfully resists them, the revelers ignore the character and resume their frolicking.</p><p>If the character fails the saving throw, he immediately slumps to the floor in a deep sleep. The affected character cannot be awakened by <i>dispel magic</i> or by any other magic short of a <i>wish</i>. While asleep, the character's spirit essence visibly leaves his body to join the minions in their revelry. Meanwhile, the character loses one level of experience for every turn his essence is engaged in revelry with the minions. If all of the revelers (except the character) are slain, the character revives; lost experience is regained at the rate of one level per four hours after the character awakens. Some revelers may even trap the character forever unless rescued, but such situations are rare.</p><p>If the revelers have no interest in inviting intruders to their party, they surround any intruders who provoke them as described above; if the intruders remain in the room with the revelers for three consecutive rounds, they must roll successful saving throws to resist falling asleep and losing experience levels.</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Searchers</b></p>  <p class=\"ni\">Searchers are spectral minions that stalk endlessly through their territory, searching for a particular object to fulfill their quest. These creatures were questing when they died in their original forms, and usually the object of the quest is not to be found within he searcher's range. Only if someone brings the object of the search to the minion can the creature's spirit be freed.</p><p>All searchers are armed and are usually lawful evil in ailgnment. They are very dangerous, for they destroy anything that stands between them and their unreachable goals.</p><p></p><p class=\"f\"><b>Warriors</b></p>  <p class=\"ni\">These minions are the spirits of mortals who were locked in combat at the time of death, usually soldiers who died in bloody battles. Groups of 100 or more warrior spectral minions are typically encountered on a battlefield, including fighters of differing alignments from both sides or a battle.</p><p>Warrior minions are always armed and fight each other constantly. However, in all cases, the minion-versus-minion combat produces no lasting damage, and the net effect is an eternal conflict between the groups. Only through the intervention of mortals can the tide of battle be turned in favor of one side or the other. Typically, characters of good alignment are approached by the leader of the good spectral minion warriors, who tries to convince them to join his side in an upcoming battle the good minion leader promises to help them, usually by supplying needed information, if good triumphs over evil. Usually, the characters need to slay at least 80% of the evil minion forces to win the battle. If the battle is won, the evil warriors disappear and the good warriors respond with a victory shout. After the good leader helps the characters as promised, he and the other good minions disappear, at last released from their quest.</p>\n","images":["<img src=\"grf/dl.gif\" width=\"150\" height=\"75\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Dragonlance\" title=\"Dragonlance\" align=\"right\">","<img src=\"img/specmini.gif\" alt=\"Spectral Minion\" title=\"Spectral Minion\" border=\"0\" width=\"300\" height=\"360\" style=\"text-align:right;\" align=\"right\">","<img src=\"grf/add2_01.gif\" width=\"200\" height=\"56\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Advanced Dungeons & Dragons 2nd Edition\">"],"setting":"Dragonlance","statblock":{"Spectral Minion":{"Activity Cycle":"Any","Alignment":"Varies","Armor Class":"2","Climate/Terrain":"Any","Damage/Attack":"Varies","Diet":"Nil","Frequency":"Very rare","Hit Dice":"Varies","Intelligence":"Average (8-10)","Magic Resistance":"20%","Morale":"Elite (13)","Movement":"30","No. Appearing":"1-20 or more","No. of Attacks":"0, 1, or 2","Organization":"Varies","Size":"M (5-7' tall)","Special Attacks":"See below","Special Defenses":"+1 or better to hit","THAC0":"Varies","Treasure":"Nil","XP Value":"Philosopher: 975<br>Reveler: 975<br>Searcher: 975<br>Guardian: 1,400<br>Warrior: 1,400<br>Berserker: 1,400"}},"title":"Spectral Minion"},"sources":["2105"],"statblock_names":[],"title":"Spectral Minion","prev_key":"specjewa","next_key":"specscio","monster_path":"/appendix/specmini"}},"staticQueryHashes":[],"slicesMap":{}}
