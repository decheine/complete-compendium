While the powers listed above are the most common, some aarakocra have different or additional powers.</p><p class=\"f\">A race of intelligent, birdlike creatures living in the deepest deserts of Athas, the rare Athasian <a href=\"/appendix/aarakocr\">aarakocra</a> spends its time soaring on thermals in search of food.</p><p>The aarakocra is 7 to 8 feet tall with a wingspan of 20 feet or more. Because of its large wingspan, an aarakocra can carry as much as 75% of its own body weight and still fly easily. An aarakocra can fly a short distance carrying a burden equaling 125% of its own body weight. The average body weight of a full grown male is 100 pounds and a female is 85 pounds.</p><p>Each wing has a &ldquo;hand&rdquo; at its midpoint, consisting of three fingers and an opposable thumb. The fourth finger forms the rigid leading edge of the wing. In flight the hands cannot be used, but on the ground the aarakocra can use its hands almost as a human would. The aarakocra's body is protected by a thin bony plate on the chest, much like a solid rib cage. Talons on its legs can be used as claws and can be retracted to reveal a second set of hands, also with three fingers and an opposable thumb. Except for the chest plate, the entire skeleton is hollow and extremely fragile.</p><p>From a distance, the Athasian aarakocra resembles a huge <a href=\"/appendix/bird\">vulture</a>. Its black eyes, set in the front of the head, provide excellent vision over a long range. The plumage is generally black with a white collar for adult males and black or brown with a smaller white collar for females. Adolescents are a mixture of brown and black. The beak is large and covers most of the head. Plumage begins at the crown of the head and is darker near the head, except for the collar. Athasian aarakocra speak their own language and the languages of vultures and other large birds. Some speak the common tongue (5% to 10% chance depending on how deep in the wastelands a tribe lives).</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Combat:</b> Aarakocra can fight in the air or on the ground. They prefer aerial combat since their bones are too fragile to withstand a solid blow from a human-sized opponent. In combat against creatures on the ground, they prefer to fly over their victim and drop weighted nets. Some aarakocra use darts to harass ground-based opponents.</p><p>If their opponents can fly, the aarakocra generally forgo the use of the net, although large groups sometimes use nets on flying creatures. Normally, aarakocra attack flying creatures with long spears, diving from above and allowing the momentum to carry the spear through the target. Such an attack doubles the damage if the aarakocra have been able to dive at least 50 feet. Only the very largest aarakocra can carry more than one of these spears, they can attack with both at once with no penalty, causing double damage on each strike. All diving attacks are made at +4 and should be treated as a charge attack. All other penalties and restrictions of charge attacks apply.</p><p>The effect of the aarakocra's nets depends on if the opponent is flying at the time it becomes entangled. Creatures on the ground that are hit by a net are entangled and unable to participate in any combat until they make a successful Strength check to get free of the net. Flying creatures hit by a net can no longer fly and immediately begin falling. If they cannot escape the net or use some magical means to arrest the fall, normal falling damage applies.</p><p>Unless victims are entangled in nets, aarakocra are cautious in ground combat. If the aarakocra outnumber their opponents they advance in a straight line and thrust with their spears. If outnumbered, or the opponents are particularly tough, the aarakocra withdraw. Victims entangled in nets are killed or incapacitated for use as food or ransom.</p><p>Athasian aarakocra are mindful of their physical limitations as well as their comparatively low psionic abilities. They do not normally initiate psionic combat. At the first sign of psionic powers from any of their victims, however, all aarakocra that have some ability will use whatever attack and defense modes they can in an attempt to destroy the threat. Large groups of is or more aarakocra may initiate psionic combat if their leaders feel they can win quickly and avoid physical combat.</p><p>In desperation, an aarakocra can attempt to bite an opponent in combat. Because of the unwieldiness of its beak, the aarakocra has a THAC0 of 18 if attacking with this appendage. Further, the birdman causes only 1d2 points of damage with the beak.</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Habitat/Society:</b> Athasian aarakocra live in tribes with 6-20 (2d8+4) members, depending on the prestige of the leader. The largest tribe ever recorded had 50 members. The tribal hunting territory depends on the size of the tribe, usually about 500 square miles for a tribe of 10 members. There are no rigid boundaries between tribes and border disputes are not uncommon.</p><p>Alignments of tribe members are similar to the alignment of the leader. A tribe that has a leader who is neutral good may have neutral good, chaotic good, lawful good, and true neutral members. A predominantly evil tribe does not recognize boundaries with other tribes and treats other tribes as inferior beings to be eliminated.</p><p>Athasian aarakocra aren't happy in enclosed spaces, but they they take refuge in a cave or building if necessary.</p><p>Nonevil tribes live in rocky aeries in the highest peaks they can find. Evil tribes are normally nomadic and use an aerie made by another tribe if they need to remain in an area for a long time, even if they have to evict the tribe that made the nest.</p><p>Aarakocra aren't friendly toward intruders in their territory, especially caravans. They try to extract a toll from the caravan for passage through the desert. Good-aligned tribes allow unhindered passage of caravans that pay a tribute. If someone refuses to pay the tribute, the aarakocra try to capture scouts or outriders from the party and hold them until an even larger tribute is paid. The payment may be either livestock or shiny objects. Aarakocra are smart enough not to be taken in by glass baubles instead of gems, although they cannot tell the difference between the more common gems and the rare ones.</p><p>Evil tribes ask for tribute and often attack a caravan whether it pays or not. Aarakocra always demand shiny objects such as stones. These tribes find humans and demihumans to be quite tasty and prefer them to other food.</p><p>Good-aligned tribes of aarakocra sometimes return a lost traveler to the edge of the desert after first removing any valuables the traveler may be carrying. On very rare occasions a tribe might return a lost group of travelers to the more frequently traveled parts of the desert, again after first taking any valuables as payment.</p><p>The oldest male is the leader of the tribal hunting party and has 4+4 Hit Dice. The oldest female is in charge of the tribal aerie and has 3+3 HD. In tribes that have more than 15 members, the next oldest aarakocra serves as shaman and has 3+3 HD; the shaman completes the triumvirate necessary for proper worship and the summoning of elementals. (Interestingly, no magic-using aarakocra has ever been recorded.) Tribes without a shaman cannot summon <a href=\"/appendix/element1\">air elementals</a>, which is an important part of aarakocra culture.</p><p>The shaman is the leader of the daily sun worship. Aarakocra worship the sun because it provides them with the thermals they need to soar in search of food. The shaman also leads the mystic rituals used to summon an air elemental. Summoning an air elemental is usually done only in preparation for the tribe's most sacred ceremony, the hunt. Small tribes must band together for this ceremony to allow the triumvirate to be formed.</p><p>The ceremony to summon an air elemental must be conducted at dawn and requires the oldest male and female to emit a highpitched keening whistle. The shaman conducts an intricate dance around them, simultaneously chanting an ancient summoning mantra.</p><p>The hunt is the final part of the initiation of adolescent aarakocra to adulthood and often takes the tribe far from their normal teritory. The target is always a <a href=\"/appendix/drakalsi\">silt drake</a>. The hunt is the only time the females leave the relative safety of the nest. Even an evil tribe will not interfere with a tribe on a hunt. An air elemental is often summoned to help find the drake, but never takes part in the actual combat. Although the adult members of the tribe take part in the initial phases of the combat, it is the initiates who deliver the final, killing blows to me drake. Scars from the hunt are considered a mark of pride among all aarakocra.</p><p>The females spend about eight months of the year incubating their eggs. Athasian aarakocra mate for life and a pair normally produces as many as 10 offspring. A female lays one egg a year. Constant incubation is not required because of the high daytime temperatures, so the females can maintain the nest and keep the tribe's treasure in order.</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Ecology:</b> Athasian aarakocra are high on the food chain and have no natural enemies other than <a href=\"/appendix/drakatha\">drakes</a>. Unless evil, aarakocra leave their own territory only to hunt the silt drake and return as soon as possible when the hunt is over. (Evil aarakocra attack others, as noted above.) Aarakocra eggs and hatchlings are sought after by wealthy land owners who wish to use the creatures as scouts and sentries. An egg can bring as much as 10 cp in Tyr's marketplace. Tribes that have had eggs or hatchlings stolen have long memories and sometimes take revenge against the thief at a later date. Captive aarakocra join any tribe they come in contact with.</p><p>Athasian aarakocra have a natural life span of 21-30 years.</p><br clear=\"all\" style=\"clear:both; height:0;\">\r\n","images":["<img src=\"grf/ds.gif\" width=\"150\" height=\"75\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Dark Sun\" title=\"Dark Sun\" align=\"right\">","<img src=\"img/aarakath.gif\" alt=\"Aarakocra (Athas)\" title=\"Aarakocra (Athas)\" border=\"0\" width=\"300\" height=\"360\" style=\"text-align:right;\" align=\"right\">","<img src=\"grf/add2_01.gif\" width=\"200\" height=\"56\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Advanced Dungeons & Dragons 2nd Edition\">"],"setting":"Dark Sun","statblock":{"Aarakocra (Athas)":{"Activity Cycle":"Day","Alignment":"Any","Armor Class":"7","Climate/Terrain":"Deep desert","Damage/Attack":"1d3/1d3 or by weapon","Diet":"Carnivore","Frequency":"Rare","Hit Dice":"2+2","Intelligence":"Average (8-10)","Magic Resistance":"Nil","Morale":"Steady (11)","Movement":"6, Fl 36 (C)","No. Appearing":"1d10","No. of Attacks":"2","Organization":"Tribal","Size":"M (20'+ wingspan)","Special Attacks":"Nil","Special Defenses":"Nil","THAC0":"17","Treasure":"Varies","XP Value":"65"}},"title":"Aarakocra (Athas)"},"sources":["2433"],"statblock_names":[],"title":"Aarakocra (Athas)","prev_key":"zygraat","next_key":"aarakocr","monster_path":"/appendix/aarakath"}}},"pageContext":{"monster_key":"shadspun","monster_data":{"TSR":["9280"],"fullBody":"  <table cellspacing=\"0\" cellpadding=\"0\"><tr><th>Climate/Terrain:</th>  <td>Any space</td></tr><tr><th>Frequency:</th>        <td>Rare</td></tr><tr><th>Organization:</th>     <td>Solitary or groups</td></tr><tr><th>Activity Cycle:</th>   <td>Any</td></tr><tr><th>Diet:</th>             <td>Special</td></tr><tr><th>Intelligence:</th>     <td>Semi- (2-4)</td></tr><tr><th>Treasure:</th>         <td>Nil</td></tr><tr><th>Alignment:</th>        <td>Chaotic neutral</td></tr><tr><th>No. Appearing:</th>    <td>1-6</td></tr><tr><th>Armor Class:</th>      <td>9</td></tr><tr><th>Movement:</th>         <td>Fl 13 (C)</td></tr><tr><th>Hit Dice:</th>         <td>7+7</td></tr><tr><th>THAC0:</th>            <td>13</td></tr><tr><th>No. of Attacks:</th>   <td>1</td></tr><tr><th>Damage/Attack:</th>    <td>1-4/round ( constriction) or 1(ram)</td></tr><tr><th>Special Attacks:</th>  <td>Gas effects</td></tr><tr><th>Special Defenses:</th> <td>Nil</td></tr><tr><th>Magic Resistance:</th> <td>Nil</td></tr><tr><th>Size:</th>             <td>G (ovoid, 36' + long)</td></tr><tr><th>Morale:</th>           <td>Steady (11)</td></tr><tr><th>XP Value:</th>         <td>1400</td></tr></table><p class=\"f\">These strange monsters are feared by all spacefarers. They drift in space until they sense the approach of an atmosphere, and attack mindlessly, absorbing precious air.</p><p>A shadowsponge appears as a greyish sponge. Hundreds of rubbery, many-branched air sacs protrude from a central mass. Studded with small, keen eyes and sensory patches, a sponge can 'smell' air in the void up to three miles away.</p><p>The substance of a shadowsponge is inedible. If struck by fiery or electrical attacks (which do normal damage), it burns with a thick, choking smoke. The smoke expands rapidly to fill a 30' spherical area, and lasts for 2-5 turns, completely blocking normal vision beyond 4', and turning clean air within its confines to foul.</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Combat:</b> A shadowsponge concentrates on absorbing air, swooping and turning continuously in an atmosphere. Any nearby creature risks being rammed or enveloped.</p><p>A ram (successful attack roll required) does 1 point of damage. The victim must make a Strength Check or be bowled over (items carried must save vs. \"fall\").</p><p>An enveloping attack surrounds a victim, squeezing and smothering for 1 point of initial damage. In subsequent rounds, enveloped beings suffer 1-4 points of constriction damage. They may automatically hit the shadowsponge with any piercing or slashing weapons in hand, but are unable to cast spells, get out other items, or wield bludgeoning weapons. Very large sponges (those of over 40 hp) can envelop two M-sized beings at once; smaller shadowsponges can entrap only one.</p><p>Any attack on a sponge may be partially suffered by an enveloped being. The being saves against the attack form (for physical weapon attacks, against Breath Weapon) to avoid taking a quarter of the damage done to the sponge (round fractions down to a minimum damage of 1 hp).</p><p>The porous, air-filled nature of a shadowsponge prevents enveloped beings from suffocating, but they must save vs. Breath Weapon on every second round or suffer the effects of harmful gases absorbed earlier by the sponge (refer to Gas Clouds in the \"Flotsam of Space\" section for such effects).</p><p>When a sponge is killed or dealt over 20 hp damage in a single round, it convulsively releases enveloped beings (who suffer damage from the attacks causing their release).</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Habitat/Society:</b> Shadowsponges are only semi-intelligent, but seem to herd together by instinct and move toward atmospheres in space. They avoid the large, stable atmospheres of worlds. Some sages believe shadowsponges are merely a stage in the lives of more advanced fungoid creatures. This stage, it is thought, ends when a sponge reaches a certain inner state by absorbing the nutrients it needs from absorbed gases. It then enters a world's atmosphere and falls to the surface, metamorphosing into spores to begin life anew in some other form.</p><p>Elminster cautions us that although this theory cannot be discounted, definite proof in support of it is so far lacking for several parts of the hypothetical life-cycle; the true nature of shadowsponges may be far different.</p><p>Shadowsponges never collide with each other or fight among themselves. They seem capable of rejoining scattered portions of themselves, or even joining with another sponge to form a larger whole, and have no reproductive lives or family units.</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Ecology:</b> Shadowsponges feed on nutrients gleaned from gases, absorbed light, and low level electrical and heat energy. Attacks relying entirely on heat for damage, and not flame (which has its usual effect), do not harm a shadowsponge, but rather give it additional or healing hit points equal to the normal damage done.</p><p>Sponges play no part in any food-chain. Alchemists and spell researchers of all races have looked in vain for uses for shadowsponge tissue and essence.</p><p>One experiment has given questionable results. Application of low-level electrical energy generated by a <i>shocking grasp</i> spell and certain gnomish energy creation and storage devices causes the sponge to release 25% of its stored atmosphere.</p><img src=\"/img/spc/shadspun.gif\" style=\"column-span: all\"/><p>Desperate spacefarers have been known to enclose shadowsponges in a spacewreck or other large, sturdy spacegoing storage container and forcibly drag them through planetoid atmospheres, and to skim the atmospheres of worlds. The intent of this stratagem is to gain a portable atmosphere allowing a too-small ship to carry too-large a crew on too-long a space voyage. A secondary use of caged shadowsponges is to steal air from enemies by setting a spacegoing cage adrift on a course that will bring it through the atmosphere of, or into a collision with, a hostile planetoid, base, ship, or elven armada craft.</p><p>Shadowsponges imprisoned or brought into contact with planetary atmospheres will take on and store air usable in space voyages, but the shock of this treatment seems to ultimately kill them. Each sponge saves vs. Petrification for every day of confinement. If it fails, it dies instantly, poisoning the air around it.</p><p>A dying shadowsponge fouls 40 tons of air. Once the entire carried atmosphere of a ship is fouled, additional 40-ton foulings turn 40 tons of fouled air into deadly air. Many an intrepid space explorer has been forced to cut loose towed space barges full of dead shadowsponges to escape the poisoned air and stagger along on inadequate air reserves.</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Herd Clouds</b></p><p class=\"f\">Some small, dark shadowsponges have been observed to lead their fellows on long voyages in space and round them up into groups. These \"herd clouds\" have recently been studied with interest by several sages.</p><p>Herd clouds have been found to be Very intelligent (11-12) and possessed of unusually high morale: Champion (15-16). They have 8+8 Hit Dice and an XP Value of 3000.</p><p>They also have the ability to gather electrical charges, discharging these as weapons against other beings. A typical herd cloud can emit one 9d6 <i>chain lightning</i> attack and two forked 6d6 <i>lightning bolts</i> in a \"day\" (144-turn period). Mere contact with, or even passing through a 'charged' herd cloud will not attract such damage unless the cloud wishes to release its energy.</p>\n","images":["<img src=\"grf/sj.gif\" width=\"150\" height=\"75\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Spelljammer\" title=\"Spelljammer\" align=\"right\">","<img src=\"img/shadspun.gif\" alt=\"Shadowsponge (Air Stealer)\" title=\"Shadowsponge (Air Stealer)\" border=\"0\" width=\"300\" height=\"360\" style=\"text-align:right;\" align=\"right\">","<img src=\"/img/spc/shadspun.gif\" style=\"column-span: all\"/>","<img src=\"grf/tsr_sm.png\" width=\"56\" height=\"59\" border=\"0\" alt=\"TSR\">"],"setting":"Spelljammer","statblock":{"Shadowsponge (Air Stealer)":{"Activity Cycle":"Any","Alignment":"Chaotic neutral","Armor Class":"9","Climate/Terrain":"Any space","Damage/Attack":"1-4/round ( constriction) or 1(ram)","Diet":"Special","Frequency":"Rare","Hit Dice":"7+7","Intelligence":"Semi- (2-4)","Magic Resistance":"Nil","Morale":"Steady (11)","Movement":"Fl 13 (C)","No. Appearing":"1-6","No. of Attacks":"1","Organization":"Solitary or groups","Size":"G (ovoid, 36' + long)","Special Attacks":"Gas effects","Special Defenses":"Nil","THAC0":"13","Treasure":"Nil","XP Value":"1400"}},"title":"Shadowsponge (Air Stealer)"},"sources":["9280"],"statblock_names":[],"title":"Shadowsponge (Air Stealer)","prev_key":"shadslow","next_key":"shadstaf","monster_path":"/appendix/shadspun"}},"staticQueryHashes":[],"slicesMap":{}}
