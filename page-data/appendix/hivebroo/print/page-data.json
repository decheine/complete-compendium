While the powers listed above are the most common, some aarakocra have different or additional powers.</p><p class=\"f\">A race of intelligent, birdlike creatures living in the deepest deserts of Athas, the rare Athasian <a href=\"/appendix/aarakocr\">aarakocra</a> spends its time soaring on thermals in search of food.</p><p>The aarakocra is 7 to 8 feet tall with a wingspan of 20 feet or more. Because of its large wingspan, an aarakocra can carry as much as 75% of its own body weight and still fly easily. An aarakocra can fly a short distance carrying a burden equaling 125% of its own body weight. The average body weight of a full grown male is 100 pounds and a female is 85 pounds.</p><p>Each wing has a &ldquo;hand&rdquo; at its midpoint, consisting of three fingers and an opposable thumb. The fourth finger forms the rigid leading edge of the wing. In flight the hands cannot be used, but on the ground the aarakocra can use its hands almost as a human would. The aarakocra's body is protected by a thin bony plate on the chest, much like a solid rib cage. Talons on its legs can be used as claws and can be retracted to reveal a second set of hands, also with three fingers and an opposable thumb. Except for the chest plate, the entire skeleton is hollow and extremely fragile.</p><p>From a distance, the Athasian aarakocra resembles a huge <a href=\"/appendix/bird\">vulture</a>. Its black eyes, set in the front of the head, provide excellent vision over a long range. The plumage is generally black with a white collar for adult males and black or brown with a smaller white collar for females. Adolescents are a mixture of brown and black. The beak is large and covers most of the head. Plumage begins at the crown of the head and is darker near the head, except for the collar. Athasian aarakocra speak their own language and the languages of vultures and other large birds. Some speak the common tongue (5% to 10% chance depending on how deep in the wastelands a tribe lives).</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Combat:</b> Aarakocra can fight in the air or on the ground. They prefer aerial combat since their bones are too fragile to withstand a solid blow from a human-sized opponent. In combat against creatures on the ground, they prefer to fly over their victim and drop weighted nets. Some aarakocra use darts to harass ground-based opponents.</p><p>If their opponents can fly, the aarakocra generally forgo the use of the net, although large groups sometimes use nets on flying creatures. Normally, aarakocra attack flying creatures with long spears, diving from above and allowing the momentum to carry the spear through the target. Such an attack doubles the damage if the aarakocra have been able to dive at least 50 feet. Only the very largest aarakocra can carry more than one of these spears, they can attack with both at once with no penalty, causing double damage on each strike. All diving attacks are made at +4 and should be treated as a charge attack. All other penalties and restrictions of charge attacks apply.</p><p>The effect of the aarakocra's nets depends on if the opponent is flying at the time it becomes entangled. Creatures on the ground that are hit by a net are entangled and unable to participate in any combat until they make a successful Strength check to get free of the net. Flying creatures hit by a net can no longer fly and immediately begin falling. If they cannot escape the net or use some magical means to arrest the fall, normal falling damage applies.</p><p>Unless victims are entangled in nets, aarakocra are cautious in ground combat. If the aarakocra outnumber their opponents they advance in a straight line and thrust with their spears. If outnumbered, or the opponents are particularly tough, the aarakocra withdraw. Victims entangled in nets are killed or incapacitated for use as food or ransom.</p><p>Athasian aarakocra are mindful of their physical limitations as well as their comparatively low psionic abilities. They do not normally initiate psionic combat. At the first sign of psionic powers from any of their victims, however, all aarakocra that have some ability will use whatever attack and defense modes they can in an attempt to destroy the threat. Large groups of is or more aarakocra may initiate psionic combat if their leaders feel they can win quickly and avoid physical combat.</p><p>In desperation, an aarakocra can attempt to bite an opponent in combat. Because of the unwieldiness of its beak, the aarakocra has a THAC0 of 18 if attacking with this appendage. Further, the birdman causes only 1d2 points of damage with the beak.</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Habitat/Society:</b> Athasian aarakocra live in tribes with 6-20 (2d8+4) members, depending on the prestige of the leader. The largest tribe ever recorded had 50 members. The tribal hunting territory depends on the size of the tribe, usually about 500 square miles for a tribe of 10 members. There are no rigid boundaries between tribes and border disputes are not uncommon.</p><p>Alignments of tribe members are similar to the alignment of the leader. A tribe that has a leader who is neutral good may have neutral good, chaotic good, lawful good, and true neutral members. A predominantly evil tribe does not recognize boundaries with other tribes and treats other tribes as inferior beings to be eliminated.</p><p>Athasian aarakocra aren't happy in enclosed spaces, but they they take refuge in a cave or building if necessary.</p><p>Nonevil tribes live in rocky aeries in the highest peaks they can find. Evil tribes are normally nomadic and use an aerie made by another tribe if they need to remain in an area for a long time, even if they have to evict the tribe that made the nest.</p><p>Aarakocra aren't friendly toward intruders in their territory, especially caravans. They try to extract a toll from the caravan for passage through the desert. Good-aligned tribes allow unhindered passage of caravans that pay a tribute. If someone refuses to pay the tribute, the aarakocra try to capture scouts or outriders from the party and hold them until an even larger tribute is paid. The payment may be either livestock or shiny objects. Aarakocra are smart enough not to be taken in by glass baubles instead of gems, although they cannot tell the difference between the more common gems and the rare ones.</p><p>Evil tribes ask for tribute and often attack a caravan whether it pays or not. Aarakocra always demand shiny objects such as stones. These tribes find humans and demihumans to be quite tasty and prefer them to other food.</p><p>Good-aligned tribes of aarakocra sometimes return a lost traveler to the edge of the desert after first removing any valuables the traveler may be carrying. On very rare occasions a tribe might return a lost group of travelers to the more frequently traveled parts of the desert, again after first taking any valuables as payment.</p><p>The oldest male is the leader of the tribal hunting party and has 4+4 Hit Dice. The oldest female is in charge of the tribal aerie and has 3+3 HD. In tribes that have more than 15 members, the next oldest aarakocra serves as shaman and has 3+3 HD; the shaman completes the triumvirate necessary for proper worship and the summoning of elementals. (Interestingly, no magic-using aarakocra has ever been recorded.) Tribes without a shaman cannot summon <a href=\"/appendix/element1\">air elementals</a>, which is an important part of aarakocra culture.</p><p>The shaman is the leader of the daily sun worship. Aarakocra worship the sun because it provides them with the thermals they need to soar in search of food. The shaman also leads the mystic rituals used to summon an air elemental. Summoning an air elemental is usually done only in preparation for the tribe's most sacred ceremony, the hunt. Small tribes must band together for this ceremony to allow the triumvirate to be formed.</p><p>The ceremony to summon an air elemental must be conducted at dawn and requires the oldest male and female to emit a highpitched keening whistle. The shaman conducts an intricate dance around them, simultaneously chanting an ancient summoning mantra.</p><p>The hunt is the final part of the initiation of adolescent aarakocra to adulthood and often takes the tribe far from their normal teritory. The target is always a <a href=\"/appendix/drakalsi\">silt drake</a>. The hunt is the only time the females leave the relative safety of the nest. Even an evil tribe will not interfere with a tribe on a hunt. An air elemental is often summoned to help find the drake, but never takes part in the actual combat. Although the adult members of the tribe take part in the initial phases of the combat, it is the initiates who deliver the final, killing blows to me drake. Scars from the hunt are considered a mark of pride among all aarakocra.</p><p>The females spend about eight months of the year incubating their eggs. Athasian aarakocra mate for life and a pair normally produces as many as 10 offspring. A female lays one egg a year. Constant incubation is not required because of the high daytime temperatures, so the females can maintain the nest and keep the tribe's treasure in order.</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Ecology:</b> Athasian aarakocra are high on the food chain and have no natural enemies other than <a href=\"/appendix/drakatha\">drakes</a>. Unless evil, aarakocra leave their own territory only to hunt the silt drake and return as soon as possible when the hunt is over. (Evil aarakocra attack others, as noted above.) Aarakocra eggs and hatchlings are sought after by wealthy land owners who wish to use the creatures as scouts and sentries. An egg can bring as much as 10 cp in Tyr's marketplace. Tribes that have had eggs or hatchlings stolen have long memories and sometimes take revenge against the thief at a later date. Captive aarakocra join any tribe they come in contact with.</p><p>Athasian aarakocra have a natural life span of 21-30 years.</p><p></p><br clear=\"all\" style=\"clear:both; height:0;\">\r\n","images":["<img src=\"grf/ds.gif\" width=\"150\" height=\"75\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Dark Sun\" title=\"Dark Sun\" align=\"right\">","<img src=\"img/aarakath.gif\" alt=\"Aarakocra (Athas)\" title=\"Aarakocra (Athas)\" border=\"0\" width=\"300\" height=\"360\" style=\"text-align:right;\" align=\"right\">","<img src=\"grf/add2_01.gif\" width=\"200\" height=\"56\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Advanced Dungeons & Dragons 2nd Edition\">"],"setting":"Dark Sun","statblock":{"Aarakocra (Athas)":{"Activity Cycle":"Day","Alignment":"Any","Armor Class":"7","Climate/Terrain":"Deep desert","Damage/Attack":"1d3/1d3 or by weapon","Diet":"Carnivore","Frequency":"Rare","Hit Dice":"2+2","Intelligence":"Average (8-10)","Magic Resistance":"Nil","Morale":"Steady (11)","Movement":"6, Fl 36 (C)","No. Appearing":"1d10","No. of Attacks":"2","Organization":"Tribal","Size":"M (20'+ wingspan)","Special Attacks":"Nil","Special Defenses":"Nil","THAC0":"17","Treasure":"Varies","XP Value":"65"}},"title":"Aarakocra (Athas)"},"sources":["2433"],"statblock_names":[],"title":"Aarakocra (Athas)","prev_key":"zygraat","next_key":"aarakocr","monster_path":"/appendix/aarakath"}}},"pageContext":{"monster_key":"hivebroo","monster_data":{"TSR":["2501"],"fullBody":"  <table cellspacing=\"0\" cellpadding=\"0\"><tr class=\"bk\"><th> </th><th class=\"cn\">Broodling</th><th class=\"cn\">Soldier</th><th class=\"cn\">Lieutenant</th><th class=\"cn\">Mother</th><th class=\"cn\">Controller</th></tr><tr><th>Climate/Terrain:</th><td>Any cavern</td><td>Any land</td><td>Any land</td><td>Any cavern</td><td>Any cavern</td></tr><tr><th>Frequency:</th><td>Rare</td><td>Rare</td><td>Very rare</td><td>Very rare</td><td>Very rare</td></tr><tr><th>Organization:</th><td>Colony</td><td>Colony</td><td>Colony</td><td>Colony</td><td>Colony</td></tr><tr><th>Activity Cycle:</th><td>Night</td><td>Night</td><td>Night</td><td>Night</td><td>Night</td></tr><tr><th>Diet:</th><td>Carnivore</td><td>Carnivore</td><td>Carnivore</td><td>Carnivore</td><td>Carnivore</td></tr><tr><th>Intelligence:</th><td>Semi- (4)</td><td>Low (7)</td><td>Average (10)</td><td>Non- (0)</td><td>Exceptional (16)</td></tr><tr><th>Treasure:</th><td>O (I)</td><td>N,O,U (J)</td><td>N,U,V (I)</td><td>N,O,U,V (I)</td><td>N,O,U,V (I)</td></tr><tr><th>Alignment:</th><td>Neutral</td><td>Neutral</td><td>Neutral</td><td>Neutral</td><td>Neutral</td></tr><tr><th>No. Appearing:</th><td>1d10&times;10</td><td>1d10&times;10</td><td>2d4</td><td>1</td><td>1d4</td></tr><tr><th>Armor Class:</th><td>6</td><td>3</td><td>2</td><td>8</td><td>6</td></tr><tr><th>Movement:</th><td>12</td><td>12</td><td>12</td><td>1</td><td>3</td></tr><tr><th>Hit Dice:</th><td>As host+1d4 hp or 2+1,<br>whichever is greater</td><td>3+1</td><td>5+1</td><td>12+2</td><td>6+6</td></tr><tr><th>THAC0:</th><td>As host or 19</td><td>17</td><td>15</td><td>9</td><td>13</td></tr><tr><th>No. of Attacks:</th><td>3 or 2</td><td>3 or 2</td><td>3 or 2</td><td>0</td><td>3</td></tr><tr><th>Damage/Attack:</th><td>1d4/1d4/1d6 or 1d6/hy weapon </td><td>1d4/1d4/1d9 or 1d8/by weapon</td><td>1d6/1d6/1d10 or 1d10/by weapon</td><td>Nil</td><td>1d4/1d4/1d6</td></tr><tr><th>Special Attacks:</th><td>Hivemind powers</td><td>Paralysis, hivemind powers</td><td>Paralysis, hivemind powers</td><td>Poisonous gas</td><td>Paralysis, hivemind powers</td></tr><tr><th>Special Defenses:</th><td>Immune to vision-<br>affecting spells</td><td>Immune to vision-<br>affecting spells</td><td>Immune to vision-<br>affecting spells</td><td>Immune to vision-<br>affecting spells</td><td>Immune to vision-<br>affecting spells</td></tr><tr><th>Magic Resistance:</th><td>Nil</td><td>Nil</td><td>Nil</td><td>Nil</td><td>Nil</td></tr><tr><th>Size:</th><td>M (4½-7' tall)</td><td>M (5' tall)</td><td>M (7' tall)</td><td>L (12' long)</td><td>M (7' long)</td></tr><tr><th>Morale:</th><td>Fearless (20)</td><td>Fearless (20)</td><td>Fearless (20)</td><td>Fearless (20)</td><td>Fearless (20)</td></tr><tr><th>XP Value:</th><td>270 or by host</td><td>420</td><td>1,400</td><td>4,000</td><td>4,000</td></tr></table><p class=\"f\"><img src=\"/img/spc/hivebroo.gif\" width=\"300\" height=\"360\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Hivebrood\" title=\"Hivebrood\" style=\"float:right;\">Hivebroods are communities of insects somewhat similar to <a href=\"/appendix/ant\">ant</a> colonies. Unlike ants, however, the large, parasitic members of a hivebrood live by infesting other beings, controlling and eventually destroying the hosts in the process. For members of a hivebrood, individuals have no meaning or worth; only the interests of the hive matter.</p><p>Hivebrood insects have many specialized forms, each one performing a specific function for the hive. The five different functional types of hivebrood member are the broodling, soldier, lieutenant, mother, and controller.</p><p>A hivebrood also contains insects in a larval form that resembles a legless beetle about 6 inches in length. The larva has 1 hit point and AC 10 and cannot move or attack on its own. Another hivebrood member places a larva on a paralyzed humanoid victim; the immature creature uses its mouth to attach itself to the back of the victim's neck, where it bites into the spinal cord and begins altering the host's metabolism.</p><p>A humanoid altered by the parasitic larva becomes a broodling, the least powerful type of mobile hivebrood insect. Eventually, a broodling develops into a soldier. Broodlings and soldiers are the most common hivebrood members.</p><p>Broodlings and soldiers follow lieutenants, a stronger form of soldier. A controller (sometimes called the hivemind) transmits knowledge and abilities to hroodlings, soldiers, and lieutenants - in effect, coordinating all the hivebrood's activities. A mother exists solely for reproduction.</p><p>All hivebrood members emit asickly sweet chemical odor and make a wet clacking sound with their large mandibles. (Broodlings use their host's teeth to imitate this sound.) The following text details each type of functional hive insect.</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Broodling</b></p>  <p class=\"ni\">Broodlings are the altered hosts of parasitic hivebrood larvae. Outsiders can recognize them by the fibrous membranes that cover their eyes and by their chitinous skin. A broodling's insectlike way of moving adds to its frightening aspect.</p><p></p><p class=\"f\"><b>Soldier</b></p>  <p class=\"ni\">Though humanoid in appearance, soldiers have antennae, compound eyes, and a tough, chitinous exoskeleton.</p><p></p><p class=\"f\"><b>Lieutenant</b></p>  <p class=\"ni\">Larger, stronger, and more intelligent than the average soldier, a lieutenant otherwise resembles the hivebrood insects it leads.</p><p></p><p class=\"f\"><b>Mother and Controller</b></p>  <p class=\"ni\">These hivebrood members control the rest of the hive. Both forms have large, sacklike bodies and insectoid faces. Although the controller can attack with its claws and bite, neither of these forms is very mobile.</p><p></p><p class=\"f\"><b>Combat:</b> In battle, all members of the hivebrood attack fearlessly, having no thought whatsoever for personal safety. The controllers guide combat; these very intelligent creatures willingly sacrifice any of their vast resources for the best advantage of the hive. All members of the hivebrood fight as well in darkness as they do in daylight, sensing the posation of opponents by feel and smell. This ability makes them immune to the effects of spells such as <i>darkness</i>, although this type of spell cast in conjunction with <i>silence</i> confuses the creatures enough to give them a -2 modifier to all attacks. Hivebrood insects suffer double damage from fire- and heat-based attacks.</p><p>The attacks of each hivebrood type follow. Note that a controller can confer additional abilities upon any creature.</p><p>Broodlings do not make the best warriors, since their bodies are still undergoing metamorphosis, but they can attack with their developing bite and claws or with a bite and one weapon (often a spear or axe).</p><p>Even poorer warriors, mothers engage in combat only if the very center of the hive faces a threat. As their only form of attack, mothers emit a cloud of noxious chemicals within a 30-foot radius. They can spew this cloud up to three times a day; those caught in the spray must make a saving throw vs. poison at a -1 penalty or suffer 3d6 points of damage per round until making a successful saving throw against the chemical cloud.</p><p>Soldiers are the hivebrood's real workers. They attack in the same manner as broodlings, but their sticky, saliva-filled bite causes paralysis (unless a successful saving throw vs. poison counters it) for 2d8 turns or until a <i>neutralize poison</i>, <i>cure serious wounds</i>, or <i>haste</i> spell helps the victim recover. Soldiers almost never kill paralyzed victims immediately; instead, they bring them into the hive to serve as hosts for new broodlings.</p><p>Lieutenants command clusters of hivebrood soldiers with military precision. These &ldquo;officers&rdquo; of the hive give orders through chemical scent emissions in a 30-foot radius. They also can &ldquo;store&rdquo; up to five hivemind abilities (see below) and pass them on to the insects under their command.</p><p>Although controllers can attack with a soldier's claws and paralytic bite, their main ability, called hivemind, remains much more fearsome. Hivemind allows a controller to gain all the abilities of the creatures it eats, including any saving throws that improve on its own. It can pass on these hivemind abilities to any hivebrood member through airborne chemical emissions. If, for example, a controller has dined on a 3rd-level thief and a 6th-level wizard, it can send out chemical signals to all in the hivebrood that enable them to hide in shadows as 3rd-level thieves or cast any of the spells the wizard had memorized at the time the character was eaten. Thus, all the members of a hive could cast fireball spells, if a controller has eaten a wizard who knew and had memorized the spell!</p><p>Fortunately, the hivemind skill transfer has limits. The chemical emissions travel at a rate of only 60 feet per round and dissipates completely after three rounds. If hivebrood insects do not use a hivemind ability within three rounds of receiving it, they lose the ability) except lieutenants, which can &ldquo;store&rdquo; abilities, as mentioned above). Furthermore, a controller can activate only one hivemind ability at a time in a single hive. If it emits a second chemical scent before the first has vanished from the minds of the hivebrood members (six rounds), recipients become confused and unable to attack, although they remain able to defend themselves. If hivebrood insects receive two or more hvemind scents from different controllers, they can use them all, though only one at a time.</p><p>Once a controller emits a hivemind ability as a chemical scent, it &ldquo;forgets&rdquo; the ability, although it may keep an unlimited number in its mind at any one time. This collection can include duplicated abilities and spells, if the controller has eaten several individuals with similar abilities.</p><p>An &ldquo;ability&rdquo; is defined as one spell (of any level or type), a skill such as a thief's ability, an attack rank, or a fighter's option such as multiple attacks, smash, parry, or disarm.</p><p>A hivebrood member loses 1 hit point in the process of casting any spell. Yet the creature will suffer the loss - even die - to cast a spell for the good of the all-important hive.</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Habitat/Society:</b> Within the hivebrood, the members form a strict and distinct hierarchy, each doing its appointed task to the best of its ability to further the goals of the hive. Each hivebrood has one mother, the queen and living center of the hive. This large creature can barely move, but others in the hivebrood protect it with fanatical devotion. Besides laying eggs, it secretes a chemical-rich, foul-smelling jelly, which it applies to certain larvae to cause them to develop into lieutenants and controllers.</p><p>Not only do the controllers dispense hivemind abilities, they make most of the hivebrood's decisions, including telling the mother when to produce another mother egg and choosing where to send this egg (with a retinue) to start another hive.</p>\r\n","images":["<img src=\"grf/ms.gif\" width=\"150\" height=\"75\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Mystara\" title=\"Mystara\" align=\"right\">","<img src=\"/img/spc/hivebroo.gif\" width=\"300\" height=\"360\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Hivebrood\" title=\"Hivebrood\" style=\"float:right;\">"],"setting":"Mystara","statblock":{"Broodling":{"Activity Cycle":"Night","Alignment":"Neutral","Armor Class":"6","Climate/Terrain":"Any cavern","Damage/Attack":"1d4/1d4/1d6 or 1d6/hy weapon ","Diet":"Carnivore","Frequency":"Rare","Hit Dice":"As host+1d4 hp or 2+1,<br>whichever is greater","Intelligence":"Semi- (4)","Magic Resistance":"Nil","Morale":"Fearless (20)","Movement":"12","No. Appearing":"1d10&times;10","No. of Attacks":"3 or 2","Organization":"Colony","Size":"M (4½-7' tall)","Special Attacks":"Hivemind powers","Special Defenses":"Immune to vision-<br>affecting spells","THAC0":"As host or 19","Treasure":"O (I)","XP Value":"270 or by host"},"Controller":{"Activity Cycle":"Night","Alignment":"Neutral","Armor Class":"6","Climate/Terrain":"Any cavern","Damage/Attack":"1d4/1d4/1d6","Diet":"Carnivore","Frequency":"Very rare","Hit Dice":"6+6","Intelligence":"Exceptional (16)","Magic Resistance":"Nil","Morale":"Fearless (20)","Movement":"3","No. Appearing":"1d4","No. of Attacks":"3","Organization":"Colony","Size":"M (7' long)","Special Attacks":"Paralysis, hivemind powers","Special Defenses":"Immune to vision-<br>affecting spells","THAC0":"13","Treasure":"N,O,U,V (I)","XP Value":"4,000"},"Lieutenant":{"Activity Cycle":"Night","Alignment":"Neutral","Armor Class":"2","Climate/Terrain":"Any land","Damage/Attack":"1d6/1d6/1d10 or 1d10/by weapon","Diet":"Carnivore","Frequency":"Very rare","Hit Dice":"5+1","Intelligence":"Average (10)","Magic Resistance":"Nil","Morale":"Fearless (20)","Movement":"12","No. Appearing":"2d4","No. of Attacks":"3 or 2","Organization":"Colony","Size":"M (7' tall)","Special Attacks":"Paralysis, hivemind powers","Special Defenses":"Immune to vision-<br>affecting spells","THAC0":"15","Treasure":"N,U,V (I)","XP Value":"1,400"},"Mother":{"Activity Cycle":"Night","Alignment":"Neutral","Armor Class":"8","Climate/Terrain":"Any cavern","Damage/Attack":"Nil","Diet":"Carnivore","Frequency":"Very rare","Hit Dice":"12+2","Intelligence":"Non- (0)","Magic Resistance":"Nil","Morale":"Fearless (20)","Movement":"1","No. Appearing":"1","No. of Attacks":"0","Organization":"Colony","Size":"L (12' long)","Special Attacks":"Poisonous gas","Special Defenses":"Immune to vision-<br>affecting spells","THAC0":"9","Treasure":"N,O,U,V (I)","XP Value":"4,000"},"Soldier":{"Activity Cycle":"Night","Alignment":"Neutral","Armor Class":"3","Climate/Terrain":"Any land","Damage/Attack":"1d4/1d4/1d9 or 1d8/by weapon","Diet":"Carnivore","Frequency":"Rare","Hit Dice":"3+1","Intelligence":"Low (7)","Magic Resistance":"Nil","Morale":"Fearless (20)","Movement":"12","No. Appearing":"1d10&times;10","No. of Attacks":"3 or 2","Organization":"Colony","Size":"M (5' tall)","Special Attacks":"Paralysis, hivemind powers","Special Defenses":"Immune to vision-<br>affecting spells","THAC0":"17","Treasure":"N,O,U (J)","XP Value":"420"}},"title":"Hivebrood"},"sources":["2501"],"statblock_names":[],"title":"Hivebrood","prev_key":"hippgrif","next_key":"hobgnork","monster_path":"/appendix/hivebroo"}},"staticQueryHashes":[],"slicesMap":{}}
