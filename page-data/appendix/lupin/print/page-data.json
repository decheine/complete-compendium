While the powers listed above are the most common, some aarakocra have different or additional powers.</p><p class=\"f\">A race of intelligent, birdlike creatures living in the deepest deserts of Athas, the rare Athasian <a href=\"/appendix/aarakocr\">aarakocra</a> spends its time soaring on thermals in search of food.</p><p>The aarakocra is 7 to 8 feet tall with a wingspan of 20 feet or more. Because of its large wingspan, an aarakocra can carry as much as 75% of its own body weight and still fly easily. An aarakocra can fly a short distance carrying a burden equaling 125% of its own body weight. The average body weight of a full grown male is 100 pounds and a female is 85 pounds.</p><p>Each wing has a &ldquo;hand&rdquo; at its midpoint, consisting of three fingers and an opposable thumb. The fourth finger forms the rigid leading edge of the wing. In flight the hands cannot be used, but on the ground the aarakocra can use its hands almost as a human would. The aarakocra's body is protected by a thin bony plate on the chest, much like a solid rib cage. Talons on its legs can be used as claws and can be retracted to reveal a second set of hands, also with three fingers and an opposable thumb. Except for the chest plate, the entire skeleton is hollow and extremely fragile.</p><p>From a distance, the Athasian aarakocra resembles a huge <a href=\"/appendix/bird\">vulture</a>. Its black eyes, set in the front of the head, provide excellent vision over a long range. The plumage is generally black with a white collar for adult males and black or brown with a smaller white collar for females. Adolescents are a mixture of brown and black. The beak is large and covers most of the head. Plumage begins at the crown of the head and is darker near the head, except for the collar. Athasian aarakocra speak their own language and the languages of vultures and other large birds. Some speak the common tongue (5% to 10% chance depending on how deep in the wastelands a tribe lives).</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Combat:</b> Aarakocra can fight in the air or on the ground. They prefer aerial combat since their bones are too fragile to withstand a solid blow from a human-sized opponent. In combat against creatures on the ground, they prefer to fly over their victim and drop weighted nets. Some aarakocra use darts to harass ground-based opponents.</p><p>If their opponents can fly, the aarakocra generally forgo the use of the net, although large groups sometimes use nets on flying creatures. Normally, aarakocra attack flying creatures with long spears, diving from above and allowing the momentum to carry the spear through the target. Such an attack doubles the damage if the aarakocra have been able to dive at least 50 feet. Only the very largest aarakocra can carry more than one of these spears, they can attack with both at once with no penalty, causing double damage on each strike. All diving attacks are made at +4 and should be treated as a charge attack. All other penalties and restrictions of charge attacks apply.</p><p>The effect of the aarakocra's nets depends on if the opponent is flying at the time it becomes entangled. Creatures on the ground that are hit by a net are entangled and unable to participate in any combat until they make a successful Strength check to get free of the net. Flying creatures hit by a net can no longer fly and immediately begin falling. If they cannot escape the net or use some magical means to arrest the fall, normal falling damage applies.</p><p>Unless victims are entangled in nets, aarakocra are cautious in ground combat. If the aarakocra outnumber their opponents they advance in a straight line and thrust with their spears. If outnumbered, or the opponents are particularly tough, the aarakocra withdraw. Victims entangled in nets are killed or incapacitated for use as food or ransom.</p><p>Athasian aarakocra are mindful of their physical limitations as well as their comparatively low psionic abilities. They do not normally initiate psionic combat. At the first sign of psionic powers from any of their victims, however, all aarakocra that have some ability will use whatever attack and defense modes they can in an attempt to destroy the threat. Large groups of is or more aarakocra may initiate psionic combat if their leaders feel they can win quickly and avoid physical combat.</p><p>In desperation, an aarakocra can attempt to bite an opponent in combat. Because of the unwieldiness of its beak, the aarakocra has a THAC0 of 18 if attacking with this appendage. Further, the birdman causes only 1d2 points of damage with the beak.</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Habitat/Society:</b> Athasian aarakocra live in tribes with 6-20 (2d8+4) members, depending on the prestige of the leader. The largest tribe ever recorded had 50 members. The tribal hunting territory depends on the size of the tribe, usually about 500 square miles for a tribe of 10 members. There are no rigid boundaries between tribes and border disputes are not uncommon.</p><p>Alignments of tribe members are similar to the alignment of the leader. A tribe that has a leader who is neutral good may have neutral good, chaotic good, lawful good, and true neutral members. A predominantly evil tribe does not recognize boundaries with other tribes and treats other tribes as inferior beings to be eliminated.</p><p>Athasian aarakocra aren't happy in enclosed spaces, but they they take refuge in a cave or building if necessary.</p><p>Nonevil tribes live in rocky aeries in the highest peaks they can find. Evil tribes are normally nomadic and use an aerie made by another tribe if they need to remain in an area for a long time, even if they have to evict the tribe that made the nest.</p><p>Aarakocra aren't friendly toward intruders in their territory, especially caravans. They try to extract a toll from the caravan for passage through the desert. Good-aligned tribes allow unhindered passage of caravans that pay a tribute. If someone refuses to pay the tribute, the aarakocra try to capture scouts or outriders from the party and hold them until an even larger tribute is paid. The payment may be either livestock or shiny objects. Aarakocra are smart enough not to be taken in by glass baubles instead of gems, although they cannot tell the difference between the more common gems and the rare ones.</p><p>Evil tribes ask for tribute and often attack a caravan whether it pays or not. Aarakocra always demand shiny objects such as stones. These tribes find humans and demihumans to be quite tasty and prefer them to other food.</p><p>Good-aligned tribes of aarakocra sometimes return a lost traveler to the edge of the desert after first removing any valuables the traveler may be carrying. On very rare occasions a tribe might return a lost group of travelers to the more frequently traveled parts of the desert, again after first taking any valuables as payment.</p><p>The oldest male is the leader of the tribal hunting party and has 4+4 Hit Dice. The oldest female is in charge of the tribal aerie and has 3+3 HD. In tribes that have more than 15 members, the next oldest aarakocra serves as shaman and has 3+3 HD; the shaman completes the triumvirate necessary for proper worship and the summoning of elementals. (Interestingly, no magic-using aarakocra has ever been recorded.) Tribes without a shaman cannot summon <a href=\"/appendix/element1\">air elementals</a>, which is an important part of aarakocra culture.</p><p>The shaman is the leader of the daily sun worship. Aarakocra worship the sun because it provides them with the thermals they need to soar in search of food. The shaman also leads the mystic rituals used to summon an air elemental. Summoning an air elemental is usually done only in preparation for the tribe's most sacred ceremony, the hunt. Small tribes must band together for this ceremony to allow the triumvirate to be formed.</p><p>The ceremony to summon an air elemental must be conducted at dawn and requires the oldest male and female to emit a highpitched keening whistle. The shaman conducts an intricate dance around them, simultaneously chanting an ancient summoning mantra.</p><p>The hunt is the final part of the initiation of adolescent aarakocra to adulthood and often takes the tribe far from their normal teritory. The target is always a <a href=\"/appendix/drakalsi\">silt drake</a>. The hunt is the only time the females leave the relative safety of the nest. Even an evil tribe will not interfere with a tribe on a hunt. An air elemental is often summoned to help find the drake, but never takes part in the actual combat. Although the adult members of the tribe take part in the initial phases of the combat, it is the initiates who deliver the final, killing blows to me drake. Scars from the hunt are considered a mark of pride among all aarakocra.</p><p>The females spend about eight months of the year incubating their eggs. Athasian aarakocra mate for life and a pair normally produces as many as 10 offspring. A female lays one egg a year. Constant incubation is not required because of the high daytime temperatures, so the females can maintain the nest and keep the tribe's treasure in order.</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Ecology:</b> Athasian aarakocra are high on the food chain and have no natural enemies other than <a href=\"/appendix/drakatha\">drakes</a>. Unless evil, aarakocra leave their own territory only to hunt the silt drake and return as soon as possible when the hunt is over. (Evil aarakocra attack others, as noted above.) Aarakocra eggs and hatchlings are sought after by wealthy land owners who wish to use the creatures as scouts and sentries. An egg can bring as much as 10 cp in Tyr's marketplace. Tribes that have had eggs or hatchlings stolen have long memories and sometimes take revenge against the thief at a later date. Captive aarakocra join any tribe they come in contact with.</p><p>Athasian aarakocra have a natural life span of 21-30 years.</p>\n","images":["<img src=\"grf/ds.gif\" width=\"150\" height=\"75\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Dark Sun\" title=\"Dark Sun\" align=\"right\">","<img src=\"img/aarakath.gif\" alt=\"Aarakocra (Athas)\" title=\"Aarakocra (Athas)\" border=\"0\" width=\"300\" height=\"360\" style=\"text-align:right;\" align=\"right\">","<img src=\"grf/add2_01.gif\" width=\"200\" height=\"56\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Advanced Dungeons & Dragons 2nd Edition\">"],"setting":"Dark Sun","statblock":{"Aarakocra (Athas)":{"Activity Cycle":"Day","Alignment":"Any","Armor Class":"7","Climate/Terrain":"Deep desert","Damage/Attack":"1d3/1d3 or by weapon","Diet":"Carnivore","Frequency":"Rare","Hit Dice":"2+2","Intelligence":"Average (8-10)","Magic Resistance":"Nil","Morale":"Steady (11)","Movement":"6, Fl 36 (C)","No. Appearing":"1d10","No. of Attacks":"2","Organization":"Tribal","Size":"M (20'+ wingspan)","Special Attacks":"Nil","Special Defenses":"Nil","THAC0":"17","Treasure":"Varies","XP Value":"65"}},"title":"Aarakocra (Athas)"},"sources":["2433"],"statblock_names":[],"title":"Aarakocra (Athas)","prev_key":"zygraat","next_key":"aarakocr","monster_path":"/appendix/aarakath"}}},"pageContext":{"monster_key":"lupin","monster_data":{"TSR":["2501","2524"],"fullBody":"  <table cellspacing=\"0\" cellpadding=\"0\"><tr><th>Climate/Terrain:</th><td>Any</td></tr><tr><th>Frequency:</th><td>Common</td></tr><tr><th>Organization:</th><td>Band</td></tr><tr><th>Activity Cycle:</th><td>Any</td></tr><tr><th>Diet:</th><td>Carnivore</td></tr><tr><th>Intelligence:</th><td>Average (8-10)</td></tr><tr><th>Treasure:</th><td>K</td></tr><tr><th>Alignment:</th><td>Any (usually good)</td></tr><tr><th>No. Appearing:</th><td>2d6</td></tr><tr><th>Armor Class:</th><td>10</td></tr><tr><th>Movement:</th><td>12</td></tr><tr><th>Hit Dice:</th><td>2</td></tr><tr><th>THAC0:</th><td>19</td></tr><tr><th>No. of Attacks:</th><td>1</td></tr><tr><th>Damage/Attack:</th><td>By weapon</td></tr><tr><th>Special Attacks:</th><td>Nil</td></tr><tr><th>Special Defenses:</th><td>Detect invisibility</td></tr><tr><th>Magic Resistance:</th><td>Nil</td></tr><tr><th>Size:</th><td>M (5-7' tall)</td></tr><tr><th>Morale:</th><td>Average (8-10)</td></tr><tr><th>XP Value:</th><td>65 or per level</td></tr></table><p class=\"f\">Lupins are canine humanoids. While a few sages believe the creatures descended from a cross between <a href=\"/appendix/gnoll\">gnolls</a> and humans, many others argue that they are an offshoot of true <a href=\"/appendix/lycawewo\">werewolves</a> (although lupins abhor all types of lycanthropes). Once nomads in the Yazak Steppes, lupins have established a fairly advanced civilization in the kingdom of Renardy.</p><p>Lupins look like furred humans with canine heads. Their short fur ranges from tan to black, with rare instances of white. An individual lupin's fur is usually one color, perhaps with some small touches of another lighter color around the muzzle, hands, and feet, but a few individuals have spots. Like humans, lupins have comparatively long hair on their heads. This is often a shade darker than the lupin's body fur, though it turns gray or white with age. Lupins usually wear their hair long and straight, though braids are not unusual.</p><p>Lupins are built much like humans, and their eyes resemble human eyes, with irises of blue, brown, or green. They also have short tails, about 2 feet long. A lupin's limbs are human in appearance, though the hands are furred on the back and have dark, leathery palms, and the feet are furred on top and have leathery soles.</p><p>Lupin personalities range widely, but most tend to be loyal to friends and somewhat rude to strangers, testing their tolerance. They are usually of good alignment, though some are neutral, and a few are evil.</p><p>The lupins of Renardy have two native languages. Renardois is spoken by all but the lowest classes in Renardy. The lupin racial language, known as Lupin, consists of barks and howls. This language is spoken mostly by peasants in Renardy.</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Combat:</b> Like humans, lupins usually attack with weapons, also using the same range of arms as humans. A lupin often carries weapons made with silver or red steel in case it should run into a <a href=\"/appendix/lycanthr\">lycanthrope</a>. Wheellock pistols are common among lupin warriors.</p><p> Warriors and priests are common in lupin society, but wizards and rogues are not unusual. A lupin ranger always chooses some kind of lycanthrope as its hated enemy, usually werewolves. Most of Renardy's nobles and knights are Beast Riders, who are all considered knights of the kingdom. Lupin Beast Riders have either dire wolf or lupasus mounts. A beast Riders almost never uses a wheellock, both because the noise from the weapon tends to startle its mount and because most consider such weapons dishonorable.</p><p>Lupins with pure white coats are often natural spellcasters. Those gifted in this way are nearly always adopted by mages or priests and taught the appropriate craft.</p><p>Lupins have infravision with a range of 60 feet. They also have excellent senses, giving them six special abilities: detecting lycanthropes, detecting invisible or ethereal beings, blind-fighting, tracking, odor recognition, and noise detection.</p><p>A lupin has a 99% chance to recognize a werewolf in any of its forms, and a 15% chance to recognize other lupins in unusual forms.When confronted with invisible creatures, a lupin receives a +4 bonus to any saving throws made for detection (as explained under &ldquo;Invisibility&rdquo; in Chapter 13 of the DMG). A lupin automatically gets a saving throw (with the bonus) when an invisible creature approaches within 10 feet, and for each round the invisible being remains that near. The lupin does not automatically know where the invisible creature is, just that it is nearby. Locating it requires other clues. A lupin can also use this ability to detect the presence of ethereal creatures, such as ghosts, phase spiders, or someone wearing plate mail of etherealness. The lupin recognizes the difference between ethereal and invisible creatures, but it gains no special attack or defense capabilities against ethereal beings.</p><p>Lupin characters automatically gain the blind-fighting proficiency without spending nonweapon proficiency slots. They also have the tracking ability, with a score equal to half their Wisdom (rounded up). A lupin character who spends slots to take the tracking proficiency gains the ability at full Wisdom rating, like rangers of other races. Lupin rangers have the ability at a rating equal to their Wisdom score with a +6 bonus.</p><p>Lupins can also recognize the smell of a person or creature they have encountered before. Recognition of a particular race is automatic, but the lupin must make a successful Intelligence check to recognize a particular individual by smell. Perfumes or strong odors in the area can give the lupin a -1 or -2 penalty to this ability, depending on the strength of the odors.</p><p>A normal lupin has a 35% chance to detect noise as thieves do. This chance increases by 2% per level after the first. Lupin thieves begin at 35% as well (which is the normal 15% of thieves, plus a 20% racial bonus), and gain their races' bonus of 2% per level; they can also improve upon this ability by adding percentage points from the 30 points per level that thieves receive.</p><p>Because of their acute senses, lupins receive a -2 penalty on all saving throws against attacks based on odor (such as those made by <a href=\"/appendix/ghoul\">ghasts</a> or <i>stinking cloud</i> spells) or sound (such as a <a href=\"/appendix/banshee\">banshee</a>'s wail or a <a href=\"/appendix/harpy\">harpy</a>'s song).</p><p>Lupins are repelled by wolfsbane. The substance is poisonous to them (even more so than it is to humans). Wolfsbane ingested by a lupin acts as Type J poison. (A failed saving throw vs. poison indicates death, while success indicates the loss of 20 hit points.) Fortunately, the keen senses of a lupin nearly always alert it in time to avoid ingesting the substance. If wolfsbane is somehow injected into a lupin's bloodstream, it acts as Type P poison. (A failed saving throw causes a 50% drop in all ability scores for 1d3 days.)</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Habitat/Society:</b> The lupins of Renardy have long imitated the humans of the Savage Baronies, mimicking their arts, nobility, hereditary laws, and philosophies. Like the humans of the Savage Coast, the lupins have a fair level of civilization and technology. The kingdom of Renardy is a merchant power with a large middle class and much diversity among its people. Most commoners are farmers and herders.</p><p>Though lupins once roamed the steppes and plains in nomadic bands, except for wandering adventurers, they are now a settled people. Some traditions still remain from nomadic days, however, such as Beast Riders, who are now considered part of the upper classes, if not actual nobility. The country has a strong feudal government, and it can raise an army for national defense within a matter of days. Renardy's borders are carefully patrolled for goblinoid incursions.</p><p>Towns in Renardy are typically wood or stone houses surrounding a central keep or castle. At one time, all towns were small enough that the people could flee to the castle in times of trouble, but this is no longer the case. Refugees from recent wars have clustered around the remaining keeps, which would now have a hard time defending all who now live nearby.</p><p>Lupin family life is similar to that of humans. Adults usually marry before having children, who are then cared for by both parents until they reach adulthood. Young lupins usually have some freedom in choosing their mates and professions, but the family can influence both choices. Nobles occasionally marry outside their class, but the middle class tends to reject marriages of nobles to peasants.</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Ecology:</b> Lupins are great producers of wine, grain, dairy products, cloth, wool, and works of art; they also extract amber and sapphires from their mines. A great deal of their exports channel through the Free City of Dunwick, a city of merchants located at the heart of the sacred tortle lands.</p><p>Lupins are on friendly terms with humans, <a href=\"/appendix/elf\">elves</a>, and <a href=\"/appendix/dwarf\">dwarves</a>. They do have occasional territorial disputes with the <a href=\"/appendix/rakasta\">rakastas</a>, but otherwise they bear them no animosity. They dislike <a href=\"/appendix/phanaton\">phanatons</a>, whose screeching hurts their ears, and they view <a href=\"/appendix/lizkinsc\">caymas</a>, <a href=\"/appendix/lizkinsc\">shazaks</a>, <a href=\"/appendix/lizkinsc\">gurrash</a>, and <a href=\"/appendix/tortle\">tortles</a> as savages of varying degrees. Lupins dislike goblinoids and hate all evil canines, especially werewolves.</p>\n","images":["<img src=\"grf/ms.gif\" width=\"150\" height=\"75\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Mystara\" title=\"Mystara\" align=\"right\">","<img src=\"img/lupin.gif\" alt=\"Lupin\" title=\"Lupin\" border=\"0\" width=\"300\" height=\"360\" style=\"text-align:right;\" align=\"right\">","<img src=\"grf/add2_01.gif\" width=\"200\" height=\"56\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Advanced Dungeons & Dragons 2nd Edition\">"],"setting":"Mystara","statblock":{"Lupin":{"Activity Cycle":"Any","Alignment":"Any (usually good)","Armor Class":"10","Climate/Terrain":"Any","Damage/Attack":"By weapon","Diet":"Carnivore","Frequency":"Common","Hit Dice":"2","Intelligence":"Average (8-10)","Magic Resistance":"Nil","Morale":"Average (8-10)","Movement":"12","No. Appearing":"2d6","No. of Attacks":"1","Organization":"Band","Size":"M (5-7' tall)","Special Attacks":"Nil","Special Defenses":"Detect invisibility","THAC0":"19","Treasure":"K","XP Value":"65 or per level"}},"title":"Lupin"},"sources":["2501","2524"],"statblock_names":[],"title":"Lupin","prev_key":"lupasus","next_key":"lurker","monster_path":"/appendix/lupin"}},"staticQueryHashes":[],"slicesMap":{}}
