While the powers listed above are the most common, some aarakocra have different or additional powers.</p><p class=\"f\">A race of intelligent, birdlike creatures living in the deepest deserts of Athas, the rare Athasian <a href=\"/appendix/aarakocr\">aarakocra</a> spends its time soaring on thermals in search of food.</p><p>The aarakocra is 7 to 8 feet tall with a wingspan of 20 feet or more. Because of its large wingspan, an aarakocra can carry as much as 75% of its own body weight and still fly easily. An aarakocra can fly a short distance carrying a burden equaling 125% of its own body weight. The average body weight of a full grown male is 100 pounds and a female is 85 pounds.</p><p>Each wing has a &ldquo;hand&rdquo; at its midpoint, consisting of three fingers and an opposable thumb. The fourth finger forms the rigid leading edge of the wing. In flight the hands cannot be used, but on the ground the aarakocra can use its hands almost as a human would. The aarakocra's body is protected by a thin bony plate on the chest, much like a solid rib cage. Talons on its legs can be used as claws and can be retracted to reveal a second set of hands, also with three fingers and an opposable thumb. Except for the chest plate, the entire skeleton is hollow and extremely fragile.</p><p>From a distance, the Athasian aarakocra resembles a huge <a href=\"/appendix/bird\">vulture</a>. Its black eyes, set in the front of the head, provide excellent vision over a long range. The plumage is generally black with a white collar for adult males and black or brown with a smaller white collar for females. Adolescents are a mixture of brown and black. The beak is large and covers most of the head. Plumage begins at the crown of the head and is darker near the head, except for the collar. Athasian aarakocra speak their own language and the languages of vultures and other large birds. Some speak the common tongue (5% to 10% chance depending on how deep in the wastelands a tribe lives).</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Combat:</b> Aarakocra can fight in the air or on the ground. They prefer aerial combat since their bones are too fragile to withstand a solid blow from a human-sized opponent. In combat against creatures on the ground, they prefer to fly over their victim and drop weighted nets. Some aarakocra use darts to harass ground-based opponents.</p><p>If their opponents can fly, the aarakocra generally forgo the use of the net, although large groups sometimes use nets on flying creatures. Normally, aarakocra attack flying creatures with long spears, diving from above and allowing the momentum to carry the spear through the target. Such an attack doubles the damage if the aarakocra have been able to dive at least 50 feet. Only the very largest aarakocra can carry more than one of these spears, they can attack with both at once with no penalty, causing double damage on each strike. All diving attacks are made at +4 and should be treated as a charge attack. All other penalties and restrictions of charge attacks apply.</p><p>The effect of the aarakocra's nets depends on if the opponent is flying at the time it becomes entangled. Creatures on the ground that are hit by a net are entangled and unable to participate in any combat until they make a successful Strength check to get free of the net. Flying creatures hit by a net can no longer fly and immediately begin falling. If they cannot escape the net or use some magical means to arrest the fall, normal falling damage applies.</p><p>Unless victims are entangled in nets, aarakocra are cautious in ground combat. If the aarakocra outnumber their opponents they advance in a straight line and thrust with their spears. If outnumbered, or the opponents are particularly tough, the aarakocra withdraw. Victims entangled in nets are killed or incapacitated for use as food or ransom.</p><p>Athasian aarakocra are mindful of their physical limitations as well as their comparatively low psionic abilities. They do not normally initiate psionic combat. At the first sign of psionic powers from any of their victims, however, all aarakocra that have some ability will use whatever attack and defense modes they can in an attempt to destroy the threat. Large groups of is or more aarakocra may initiate psionic combat if their leaders feel they can win quickly and avoid physical combat.</p><p>In desperation, an aarakocra can attempt to bite an opponent in combat. Because of the unwieldiness of its beak, the aarakocra has a THAC0 of 18 if attacking with this appendage. Further, the birdman causes only 1d2 points of damage with the beak.</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Habitat/Society:</b> Athasian aarakocra live in tribes with 6-20 (2d8+4) members, depending on the prestige of the leader. The largest tribe ever recorded had 50 members. The tribal hunting territory depends on the size of the tribe, usually about 500 square miles for a tribe of 10 members. There are no rigid boundaries between tribes and border disputes are not uncommon.</p><p>Alignments of tribe members are similar to the alignment of the leader. A tribe that has a leader who is neutral good may have neutral good, chaotic good, lawful good, and true neutral members. A predominantly evil tribe does not recognize boundaries with other tribes and treats other tribes as inferior beings to be eliminated.</p><p>Athasian aarakocra aren't happy in enclosed spaces, but they they take refuge in a cave or building if necessary.</p><p>Nonevil tribes live in rocky aeries in the highest peaks they can find. Evil tribes are normally nomadic and use an aerie made by another tribe if they need to remain in an area for a long time, even if they have to evict the tribe that made the nest.</p><p>Aarakocra aren't friendly toward intruders in their territory, especially caravans. They try to extract a toll from the caravan for passage through the desert. Good-aligned tribes allow unhindered passage of caravans that pay a tribute. If someone refuses to pay the tribute, the aarakocra try to capture scouts or outriders from the party and hold them until an even larger tribute is paid. The payment may be either livestock or shiny objects. Aarakocra are smart enough not to be taken in by glass baubles instead of gems, although they cannot tell the difference between the more common gems and the rare ones.</p><p>Evil tribes ask for tribute and often attack a caravan whether it pays or not. Aarakocra always demand shiny objects such as stones. These tribes find humans and demihumans to be quite tasty and prefer them to other food.</p><p>Good-aligned tribes of aarakocra sometimes return a lost traveler to the edge of the desert after first removing any valuables the traveler may be carrying. On very rare occasions a tribe might return a lost group of travelers to the more frequently traveled parts of the desert, again after first taking any valuables as payment.</p><p>The oldest male is the leader of the tribal hunting party and has 4+4 Hit Dice. The oldest female is in charge of the tribal aerie and has 3+3 HD. In tribes that have more than 15 members, the next oldest aarakocra serves as shaman and has 3+3 HD; the shaman completes the triumvirate necessary for proper worship and the summoning of elementals. (Interestingly, no magic-using aarakocra has ever been recorded.) Tribes without a shaman cannot summon <a href=\"/appendix/element1\">air elementals</a>, which is an important part of aarakocra culture.</p><p>The shaman is the leader of the daily sun worship. Aarakocra worship the sun because it provides them with the thermals they need to soar in search of food. The shaman also leads the mystic rituals used to summon an air elemental. Summoning an air elemental is usually done only in preparation for the tribe's most sacred ceremony, the hunt. Small tribes must band together for this ceremony to allow the triumvirate to be formed.</p><p>The ceremony to summon an air elemental must be conducted at dawn and requires the oldest male and female to emit a highpitched keening whistle. The shaman conducts an intricate dance around them, simultaneously chanting an ancient summoning mantra.</p><p>The hunt is the final part of the initiation of adolescent aarakocra to adulthood and often takes the tribe far from their normal teritory. The target is always a <a href=\"/appendix/drakalsi\">silt drake</a>. The hunt is the only time the females leave the relative safety of the nest. Even an evil tribe will not interfere with a tribe on a hunt. An air elemental is often summoned to help find the drake, but never takes part in the actual combat. Although the adult members of the tribe take part in the initial phases of the combat, it is the initiates who deliver the final, killing blows to me drake. Scars from the hunt are considered a mark of pride among all aarakocra.</p><p>The females spend about eight months of the year incubating their eggs. Athasian aarakocra mate for life and a pair normally produces as many as 10 offspring. A female lays one egg a year. Constant incubation is not required because of the high daytime temperatures, so the females can maintain the nest and keep the tribe's treasure in order.</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Ecology:</b> Athasian aarakocra are high on the food chain and have no natural enemies other than <a href=\"/appendix/drakatha\">drakes</a>. Unless evil, aarakocra leave their own territory only to hunt the silt drake and return as soon as possible when the hunt is over. (Evil aarakocra attack others, as noted above.) Aarakocra eggs and hatchlings are sought after by wealthy land owners who wish to use the creatures as scouts and sentries. An egg can bring as much as 10 cp in Tyr's marketplace. Tribes that have had eggs or hatchlings stolen have long memories and sometimes take revenge against the thief at a later date. Captive aarakocra join any tribe they come in contact with.</p><p>Athasian aarakocra have a natural life span of 21-30 years.</p><p></p><br clear=\"all\" style=\"clear:both; height:0;\">\r\n","images":["<img src=\"grf/ds.gif\" width=\"150\" height=\"75\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Dark Sun\" title=\"Dark Sun\" align=\"right\">","<img src=\"img/aarakath.gif\" alt=\"Aarakocra (Athas)\" title=\"Aarakocra (Athas)\" border=\"0\" width=\"300\" height=\"360\" style=\"text-align:right;\" align=\"right\">","<img src=\"grf/add2_01.gif\" width=\"200\" height=\"56\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Advanced Dungeons & Dragons 2nd Edition\">"],"setting":"Dark Sun","statblock":{"Aarakocra (Athas)":{"Activity Cycle":"Day","Alignment":"Any","Armor Class":"7","Climate/Terrain":"Deep desert","Damage/Attack":"1d3/1d3 or by weapon","Diet":"Carnivore","Frequency":"Rare","Hit Dice":"2+2","Intelligence":"Average (8-10)","Magic Resistance":"Nil","Morale":"Steady (11)","Movement":"6, Fl 36 (C)","No. Appearing":"1d10","No. of Attacks":"2","Organization":"Tribal","Size":"M (20'+ wingspan)","Special Attacks":"Nil","Special Defenses":"Nil","THAC0":"17","Treasure":"Varies","XP Value":"65"}},"title":"Aarakocra (Athas)"},"sources":["2433"],"statblock_names":[],"title":"Aarakocra (Athas)","prev_key":"zygraat","next_key":"aarakocr","monster_path":"/appendix/aarakath"}}},"pageContext":{"monster_key":"minilost","monster_data":{"TSR":["3140"],"fullBody":"  <table cellspacing=\"0\" cellpadding=\"0\"><tr class=\"bk\"><th> </th><th class=\"cn\">Halfling Spawn</th><th class=\"cn\">Masetian Spawn</th><th class=\"cn\">Orog Spawn</th></tr><tr><th>Climate/Terrain:</th>  <td>Cerilian or Shadow World forests</td><td>Shadow World</td><td>Shadow World</td></tr><tr><th>Frequency:</th>        <td>Uncommon</td><td>Rare</td><td>Rare</td></tr><tr><th>Organization:</th>     <td>Community</td><td>Community</td><td>Community</td></tr><tr><th>Activity Cycle:</th>   <td>Day</td><td>Day</td><td>Any</td></tr><tr><th>Diet:</th>             <td>Omnivore</td><td>Omnivore</td><td>Carnivore</td></tr><tr><th>Intelligence:</th>     <td>Average (8-10)</td><td>Very (11-12)</td><td>Low (5-7)</td></tr><tr><th>Treasure:</th>         <td>J (O, P)</td><td>K (M, P)</td><td>J (O)</td></tr><tr><th>Alignment:</th>        <td>Neutral evil</td><td>Lawful evil</td><td>Chaotic evil</td></tr><tr><th>No. Appearing:</th>    <td>3-24 (10-100)</td><td>3-24 (10-100)</td><td>3-24 (10-100)</td></tr><tr><th>Armor Class:</th>      <td>6</td><td>8 (10)</td><td>3 (armored torso), 5 (lower body and unarmored torso)</td></tr><tr><th>Movement:</th>         <td>6, 12 in trees</td><td>12</td><td>12</td></tr><tr><th>Hit Dice:</th>         <td>2</td><td>3</td><td>4+4</td></tr><tr><th>THAC0:</th>            <td>19</td><td>18</td><td>17</td></tr><tr><th>No. of Attacks:</th>   <td>1 (missile) or 3 (melee)</td><td>1</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><th>Damage/Attack:</th>    <td>By weapon or 1d4/1d4/1d8</td><td>By weapon or 1d6</td><td>By weapon +2</td></tr><tr><th>Special Attacks:</th>  <td>Strangle</td><td>Bite</td><td>Nil</td></tr><tr><th>Special Defenses:</th> <td>Resists poison</td><td>See text</td><td>Nil</td></tr><tr><th>Magic Resistance:</th> <td>See below</td><td>Nil</td><td>Nil</td></tr><tr><th>Size:</th>             <td>S (3' 6\" tall)</td><td>M (6' tall)</td><td>H (7' tall, 20' long)</td></tr><tr><th>Morale:</th>           <td>Average (8-10)</td><td>Steady (11-12)</td><td>Elite (13-14)</td></tr><tr><th>Bloodline:</th>        <td>None</td><td>None</td><td>None</td></tr><tr><th>Blood Abilities:</th>  <td>None</td><td>None</td><td>None</td></tr><tr><th>Perception/Seeming:</th> <td>Middling/Lesser</td><td>Lesser/None</td><td>Slight/None</td></tr><tr><th>XP Value:</th>         <td></td><td>175</td><td>270</td></tr></table><p class=\"f\">More than two millennia ago, even before the first Adurian tribes fled to Cerilia's shores, Azrai hand-picked twelve vile humans and instructed them in the arts of dark sorcery. These most exalted of the Evil One's servants fought on his side in the battle at Mount Deismaar. The forceof that cataclysm blasted the sorcerers into the Shadow World. In Cerilia, where no one knew what had happened to them, these wizards became known as the Lost.</p><p>The minions of the Lost are former humans, humanoids, and demihumans transformed into new races. These races exist solely to serve their evil creators. </p><p>While each race of minions has its own unique appearance, all minions retain characteristics of their former races (human, elven, goblin, giant, etc.). Some of these attributes are physical, such as build or acute senses. Some are mental, such as intelligence. All minions speak the language of their race of origin.</p><p>The minion races are too numerous to list here in full, but they include the following:</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Halfling Spawn</b></p><p class=\"ni\">Many evil denizens of the Shadow World have enslaved the native halflings, but only the Lost have monstrously mutated the race. Several members of the Lost have created their own unique breeds of halfling spawn. Those of Macchius sport monkey tails, unusually long and sinuous arms, and clawed paws that allow the halfling spawn to swing from trees and move quickly through the dense, gnarled forests of the Shadow World. </p><p class=\"f\"><b>Masetian Spawn</b></p><p class=\"ni\">The Mount Deismaar cataclysm obliterated most Masetians from the face of Cerilia, but some found themselves in the Shadow World. One member of the Lost found this race ideal as servants—with a few adjustments. Masetian spawn retain their human bodies and swarthy coloring but bear the heads, agility, and senses of Siamese cats. (Ironically, these minions came into being accidently when their creator's familiar strayed into a magical experiment the spellcaster was conducting on a Masetian. The resulting feline humanoid exhibited such superior senses and stealth that the wizard bred dozens of litters to serve as spies.) Masetian spawn can sneak through the Shadow World's murky twilight better than many native races.</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Orog Spawn</b></p><p class=\"ni\">When a raiding party of Cerilian orogs charged right through a portal and into the Shadow World, several members of the Lost found the vicious, battle-minded race worth studying. In the years since, several varieties of orog minions have evolved, including one that crosses the orogs with their signature mounts. These centaurlike spawn have the upper torsos of orogs and the bodies of giant lizards.</p><br><p class=\"f\">The Lost are among the strongest and most important denizens of the Shadow World. They have had 2,000 years to amass power, knowledge, and followers. The first, they seized; the second, they researched. The third, they created for themselves. </p><p>The minions of the Lost are those creatures who—willingly or unwillingly— serve the twelve evil wizards. A part y might encounter them on their own as they complete a task for their master, or characters might have to battle their way through the minions to get to the master.</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Combat:</b> Encounters with minions of the Lost vary depending on the type of minion involved.</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Halfling spawn </b> wear leather armor to provide enough freedom of movement to swing from tree branches. This choice of a rmor also enables them to gain the advantage of surprise in many encounters: Opponents suffer a -4 penalty to surprise ro l l s</p><p>These minions attack with slings and thrown missiles from a distance, and with their claws at close range. Like ordinary halflings, the spawn gain a +1 bonus to attacks with missiles. In melee, these minions swipe with their claws for 1d4 points of damage each.</p><p>During hand-to-hand combat, halfling spawn attempt to strangle their opponents with their long, muscular tails. A successful “hit” means the minion has wrapped its tail around a victim's throat. Each round that the choke hold remains in effect, the victim suffers 1d8 points of damage and must succeed at a saving throw vs. paralyzation or lose consciousness for 1d4 turns. </p><p>Halfling spawn enjoy a +2 bonus to saving throws vs. poison, wands, staves, rods, and spells. </p><p class=\"f\"><b>Masetian spawn </b> have acute senses that allow them to be surprised on only a 1 or 2. In addition, opponents suffer a -3 penalty to surprise rolls. These minions can use any missile or melee weapon ordinary Cerilian humans do. They can also bite for 1d6 points of damage.</p><p>The natural agility of Masetian spawn enables them to move silently (50%), hide in shadows (45%), detect noise (45%), and climb walls (90%) per the thief abilities. </p><p class=\"f\"><b>Orog spawn </b> have thick, hairy hide instead of ordinary skin on their torsos, which grants them an Armor Class of 5 on their upper bodies that matches the AC 5 of their lizard lower bodies. Most orog spawn wear armor, however, to bring their upper body Armor Class to 3. </p><p>These minions favor axes, crossbows, heavy long swords, maces, and polearms. Their strength grants them a +2 damage bonus to attacks made with these weapons. Bright sunlight blinds and nauseates orog spawn, inflicting a -3 penalty to attack and saving throws.</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Other types of minions </b> can enjoy a range of special abilities and defenses, depending on the type of acts their creator wishes them to perform. Such attributes can include character-class-specific abilities such as spellcasting, thief skills, or weapon specialization. They can also include special attack and defense modes (poison, paralyzation, regeneration, etc.). </p><p>Because minions of the Lost tend to be intelligent creatures, it is possible to converse with them. Minions, however, know little of their masters' plans beyond the immediate task assigned to them.</p><p>Minions of the Lost generally develop at least some ability to penetrate the Seeming. Only minions based on native Shadow World races, however, have any ability to manipulate it. </p><p class=\"f\"><b>Habitat/Society:</b> Minions live in small communities, usually within their masters' compounds (as some of the Lost have found their way back into Cerilia, they have brought their minions with them). They are monitored by an overseer or warden; sometimes this individual is a member of the minions' own race who has gained the trust of the wizard.</p><p>An individual member of the Lost may have multiple races of minions as servants. Occasionally, fights break out among the different races—but punishment is swift and memorable enough that such incidents are rare. </p><p class=\"f\"><b>Ecology:</b> The first minions were the result of magical experimentation. Each member of the Lost sought to create his or her own followers, and tried different approaches on different creatures until each developed the “perfect” minion to suit individual taste.</p><p>Once a significant number of minions of each race were created, they began to breed. Each race's population now supports itself, under the watchful eye of its creator. Like any slavemaster, the wizard encourages enough reproduction to provide a steady supply of servants, but keeps the population small enough to prevent uprisings. The harsh life of enslavement to an evil master serves as its own population check, as it results in a low life expectancy: about one-fifth that of the minion's race of origin.</p><p>Most minions are omnivores. Those generated from races that have more limited diets (such as vegetarian elves or carnivorous goblins) retain those dietary restrictions.</p><p><a href=\"/appendix/shade\">Shades</a> (see separate entry) are another type of Lost minion. Unlike the “spawn” minions, shades may be used by any member of the Lost, and cannot reproduce. The Lost also summon monsters from this plane and beyond to do their bidding. </p><p>Other types of creatures, such as the awnsheghlien, also create and/or enslave minions.</p><br clear=\"all\" style=\"clear:both; height:0;\">\r\n","images":["<img src=\"grf/br.gif\" width=\"150\" height=\"75\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Birthright\" title=\"Birthright\" align=\"right\">","<img src=\"grf/tsr_sm.png\" width=\"56\" height=\"59\" border=\"0\" alt=\"TSR\">"],"setting":"Birthright","statblock":{"Halfling Spawn":{"Activity Cycle":"Day","Alignment":"Neutral evil","Armor Class":"6","Blood Abilities":"None","Bloodline":"None","Climate/Terrain":"Cerilian or Shadow World forests","Damage/Attack":"By weapon or 1d4/1d4/1d8","Diet":"Omnivore","Frequency":"Uncommon","Hit Dice":"2","Intelligence":"Average (8-10)","Magic Resistance":"See below","Morale":"Average (8-10)","Movement":"6, 12 in trees","No. Appearing":"3-24 (10-100)","No. of Attacks":"1 (missile) or 3 (melee)","Organization":"Community","Perception/Seeming":"Middling/Lesser","Size":"S (3' 6\" tall)","Special Attacks":"Strangle","Special Defenses":"Resists poison","THAC0":"19","Treasure":"J (O, P)","XP Value":""},"Masetian Spawn":{"Activity Cycle":"Day","Alignment":"Lawful evil","Armor Class":"8 (10)","Blood Abilities":"None","Bloodline":"None","Climate/Terrain":"Shadow World","Damage/Attack":"By weapon or 1d6","Diet":"Omnivore","Frequency":"Rare","Hit Dice":"3","Intelligence":"Very (11-12)","Magic Resistance":"Nil","Morale":"Steady (11-12)","Movement":"12","No. Appearing":"3-24 (10-100)","No. of Attacks":"1","Organization":"Community","Perception/Seeming":"Lesser/None","Size":"M (6' tall)","Special Attacks":"Bite","Special Defenses":"See text","THAC0":"18","Treasure":"K (M, P)","XP Value":"175"},"Orog Spawn":{"Activity Cycle":"Any","Alignment":"Chaotic evil","Armor Class":"3 (armored torso), 5 (lower body and unarmored torso)","Blood Abilities":"None","Bloodline":"None","Climate/Terrain":"Shadow World","Damage/Attack":"By weapon +2","Diet":"Carnivore","Frequency":"Rare","Hit Dice":"4+4","Intelligence":"Low (5-7)","Magic Resistance":"Nil","Morale":"Elite (13-14)","Movement":"12","No. Appearing":"3-24 (10-100)","No. of Attacks":"1","Organization":"Community","Perception/Seeming":"Slight/None","Size":"H (7' tall, 20' long)","Special Attacks":"Nil","Special Defenses":"Nil","THAC0":"17","Treasure":"J (O)","XP Value":"270"}},"title":"Minion of the Lost"},"sources":["3140"],"statblock_names":[],"title":"Minion of the Lost","prev_key":"minidivi","next_key":"minioset","monster_path":"/appendix/minilost"}},"staticQueryHashes":[],"slicesMap":{}}
