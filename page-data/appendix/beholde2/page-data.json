While the powers listed above are the most common, some aarakocra have different or additional powers.</p><p class=\"f\">A race of intelligent, birdlike creatures living in the deepest deserts of Athas, the rare Athasian <a href=\"/appendix/aarakocr\">aarakocra</a> spends its time soaring on thermals in search of food.</p><p>The aarakocra is 7 to 8 feet tall with a wingspan of 20 feet or more. Because of its large wingspan, an aarakocra can carry as much as 75% of its own body weight and still fly easily. An aarakocra can fly a short distance carrying a burden equaling 125% of its own body weight. The average body weight of a full grown male is 100 pounds and a female is 85 pounds.</p><p>Each wing has a &ldquo;hand&rdquo; at its midpoint, consisting of three fingers and an opposable thumb. The fourth finger forms the rigid leading edge of the wing. In flight the hands cannot be used, but on the ground the aarakocra can use its hands almost as a human would. The aarakocra's body is protected by a thin bony plate on the chest, much like a solid rib cage. Talons on its legs can be used as claws and can be retracted to reveal a second set of hands, also with three fingers and an opposable thumb. Except for the chest plate, the entire skeleton is hollow and extremely fragile.</p><p>From a distance, the Athasian aarakocra resembles a huge <a href=\"/appendix/bird\">vulture</a>. Its black eyes, set in the front of the head, provide excellent vision over a long range. The plumage is generally black with a white collar for adult males and black or brown with a smaller white collar for females. Adolescents are a mixture of brown and black. The beak is large and covers most of the head. Plumage begins at the crown of the head and is darker near the head, except for the collar. Athasian aarakocra speak their own language and the languages of vultures and other large birds. Some speak the common tongue (5% to 10% chance depending on how deep in the wastelands a tribe lives).</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Combat:</b> Aarakocra can fight in the air or on the ground. They prefer aerial combat since their bones are too fragile to withstand a solid blow from a human-sized opponent. In combat against creatures on the ground, they prefer to fly over their victim and drop weighted nets. Some aarakocra use darts to harass ground-based opponents.</p><p>If their opponents can fly, the aarakocra generally forgo the use of the net, although large groups sometimes use nets on flying creatures. Normally, aarakocra attack flying creatures with long spears, diving from above and allowing the momentum to carry the spear through the target. Such an attack doubles the damage if the aarakocra have been able to dive at least 50 feet. Only the very largest aarakocra can carry more than one of these spears, they can attack with both at once with no penalty, causing double damage on each strike. All diving attacks are made at +4 and should be treated as a charge attack. All other penalties and restrictions of charge attacks apply.</p><p>The effect of the aarakocra's nets depends on if the opponent is flying at the time it becomes entangled. Creatures on the ground that are hit by a net are entangled and unable to participate in any combat until they make a successful Strength check to get free of the net. Flying creatures hit by a net can no longer fly and immediately begin falling. If they cannot escape the net or use some magical means to arrest the fall, normal falling damage applies.</p><p>Unless victims are entangled in nets, aarakocra are cautious in ground combat. If the aarakocra outnumber their opponents they advance in a straight line and thrust with their spears. If outnumbered, or the opponents are particularly tough, the aarakocra withdraw. Victims entangled in nets are killed or incapacitated for use as food or ransom.</p><p>Athasian aarakocra are mindful of their physical limitations as well as their comparatively low psionic abilities. They do not normally initiate psionic combat. At the first sign of psionic powers from any of their victims, however, all aarakocra that have some ability will use whatever attack and defense modes they can in an attempt to destroy the threat. Large groups of is or more aarakocra may initiate psionic combat if their leaders feel they can win quickly and avoid physical combat.</p><p>In desperation, an aarakocra can attempt to bite an opponent in combat. Because of the unwieldiness of its beak, the aarakocra has a THAC0 of 18 if attacking with this appendage. Further, the birdman causes only 1d2 points of damage with the beak.</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Habitat/Society:</b> Athasian aarakocra live in tribes with 6-20 (2d8+4) members, depending on the prestige of the leader. The largest tribe ever recorded had 50 members. The tribal hunting territory depends on the size of the tribe, usually about 500 square miles for a tribe of 10 members. There are no rigid boundaries between tribes and border disputes are not uncommon.</p><p>Alignments of tribe members are similar to the alignment of the leader. A tribe that has a leader who is neutral good may have neutral good, chaotic good, lawful good, and true neutral members. A predominantly evil tribe does not recognize boundaries with other tribes and treats other tribes as inferior beings to be eliminated.</p><p>Athasian aarakocra aren't happy in enclosed spaces, but they they take refuge in a cave or building if necessary.</p><p>Nonevil tribes live in rocky aeries in the highest peaks they can find. Evil tribes are normally nomadic and use an aerie made by another tribe if they need to remain in an area for a long time, even if they have to evict the tribe that made the nest.</p><p>Aarakocra aren't friendly toward intruders in their territory, especially caravans. They try to extract a toll from the caravan for passage through the desert. Good-aligned tribes allow unhindered passage of caravans that pay a tribute. If someone refuses to pay the tribute, the aarakocra try to capture scouts or outriders from the party and hold them until an even larger tribute is paid. The payment may be either livestock or shiny objects. Aarakocra are smart enough not to be taken in by glass baubles instead of gems, although they cannot tell the difference between the more common gems and the rare ones.</p><p>Evil tribes ask for tribute and often attack a caravan whether it pays or not. Aarakocra always demand shiny objects such as stones. These tribes find humans and demihumans to be quite tasty and prefer them to other food.</p><p>Good-aligned tribes of aarakocra sometimes return a lost traveler to the edge of the desert after first removing any valuables the traveler may be carrying. On very rare occasions a tribe might return a lost group of travelers to the more frequently traveled parts of the desert, again after first taking any valuables as payment.</p><p>The oldest male is the leader of the tribal hunting party and has 4+4 Hit Dice. The oldest female is in charge of the tribal aerie and has 3+3 HD. In tribes that have more than 15 members, the next oldest aarakocra serves as shaman and has 3+3 HD; the shaman completes the triumvirate necessary for proper worship and the summoning of elementals. (Interestingly, no magic-using aarakocra has ever been recorded.) Tribes without a shaman cannot summon <a href=\"/appendix/element1\">air elementals</a>, which is an important part of aarakocra culture.</p><p>The shaman is the leader of the daily sun worship. Aarakocra worship the sun because it provides them with the thermals they need to soar in search of food. The shaman also leads the mystic rituals used to summon an air elemental. Summoning an air elemental is usually done only in preparation for the tribe's most sacred ceremony, the hunt. Small tribes must band together for this ceremony to allow the triumvirate to be formed.</p><p>The ceremony to summon an air elemental must be conducted at dawn and requires the oldest male and female to emit a highpitched keening whistle. The shaman conducts an intricate dance around them, simultaneously chanting an ancient summoning mantra.</p><p>The hunt is the final part of the initiation of adolescent aarakocra to adulthood and often takes the tribe far from their normal teritory. The target is always a <a href=\"/appendix/drakalsi\">silt drake</a>. The hunt is the only time the females leave the relative safety of the nest. Even an evil tribe will not interfere with a tribe on a hunt. An air elemental is often summoned to help find the drake, but never takes part in the actual combat. Although the adult members of the tribe take part in the initial phases of the combat, it is the initiates who deliver the final, killing blows to me drake. Scars from the hunt are considered a mark of pride among all aarakocra.</p><p>The females spend about eight months of the year incubating their eggs. Athasian aarakocra mate for life and a pair normally produces as many as 10 offspring. A female lays one egg a year. Constant incubation is not required because of the high daytime temperatures, so the females can maintain the nest and keep the tribe's treasure in order.</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Ecology:</b> Athasian aarakocra are high on the food chain and have no natural enemies other than <a href=\"/appendix/drakatha\">drakes</a>. Unless evil, aarakocra leave their own territory only to hunt the silt drake and return as soon as possible when the hunt is over. (Evil aarakocra attack others, as noted above.) Aarakocra eggs and hatchlings are sought after by wealthy land owners who wish to use the creatures as scouts and sentries. An egg can bring as much as 10 cp in Tyr's marketplace. Tribes that have had eggs or hatchlings stolen have long memories and sometimes take revenge against the thief at a later date. Captive aarakocra join any tribe they come in contact with.</p><p>Athasian aarakocra have a natural life span of 21-30 years.</p><br clear=\"all\" style=\"clear:both; height:0;\">\r\n","images":["<img src=\"grf/ds.gif\" width=\"150\" height=\"75\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Dark Sun\" title=\"Dark Sun\" align=\"right\">","<img src=\"img/aarakath.gif\" alt=\"Aarakocra (Athas)\" title=\"Aarakocra (Athas)\" border=\"0\" width=\"300\" height=\"360\" style=\"text-align:right;\" align=\"right\">","<img src=\"grf/add2_01.gif\" width=\"200\" height=\"56\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Advanced Dungeons & Dragons 2nd Edition\">"],"setting":"Dark Sun","statblock":{"Aarakocra (Athas)":{"Activity Cycle":"Day","Alignment":"Any","Armor Class":"7","Climate/Terrain":"Deep desert","Damage/Attack":"1d3/1d3 or by weapon","Diet":"Carnivore","Frequency":"Rare","Hit Dice":"2+2","Intelligence":"Average (8-10)","Magic Resistance":"Nil","Morale":"Steady (11)","Movement":"6, Fl 36 (C)","No. Appearing":"1d10","No. of Attacks":"2","Organization":"Tribal","Size":"M (20'+ wingspan)","Special Attacks":"Nil","Special Defenses":"Nil","THAC0":"17","Treasure":"Varies","XP Value":"65"}},"title":"Aarakocra (Athas)"},"sources":["2433"],"statblock_names":[],"title":"Aarakocra (Athas)","prev_key":"zygraat","next_key":"aarakocr","monster_path":"/appendix/aarakath"}}},"pageContext":{"monster_key":"beholde2","monster_data":{"TSR":["2140","1049"],"fullBody":"  <table cellspacing=\"0\" cellpadding=\"0\"><tr class=\"bk\"><th> </th><th class=\"cn\">Hive Mother</th><th class=\"cn\">Director</th><th class=\"cn\">Examiner</th><th class=\"cn\">Lensman</th><th class=\"cn\">Overseer</th><th class=\"cn\">Watcher</th></tr><tr><th>Climate/Terrain:</th><td>Any remote</td><td>Any remote</td><td>Any remote</td><td>Any remote</td><td>Any remote</td><td>Any remote</td></tr><tr><th>Frequency:</th><td>Very rare</td><td>Very rare</td><td>Very rare</td><td>Very rare</td><td>Very rare</td><td>Very rare</td></tr><tr><th>Organization:</th><td>Solitary</td><td>Squad</td><td>Squad</td><td>Squad</td><td>Solitary</td><td>Solitary</td></tr><tr><th>Activity Cycle:</th><td>Any</td><td>Day</td><td>Night</td><td>Day</td><td>Any</td><td>Any</td></tr><tr><th>Diet:</th><td>Omnivore</td><td>Omnivore</td><td>Omnivore</td><td>Insectivore</td><td>Omnivore</td><td>Scavenger</td></tr><tr><th>Intelligence:</th><td>Genius (17-18)</td><td>Average (8-10)</td><td>Genius (17-18)</td><td>Low (5-7)</td><td>Supra-genius (19-20)</td><td>Semi- (2-4)</td></tr><tr><th>Treasure:</th><td>I,S,T</td><td>G</td><td>V&times;4</td><td>R</td><td>U</td><td>Nil</td></tr><tr><th>Alignment:</th><td>Lawful evil</td><td>Lawful evil</td><td>Lawful neutral</td><td>Neutral evil</td><td>Lawful evil</td><td>Neutral</td></tr><tr><th>No. Appearing:</th><td>1</td><td>2-5</td><td>1-6</td><td>1-10</td><td>1</td><td>1-4</td></tr><tr><th>Armor Class:</th><td>0</td><td>2 (4)</td><td>5</td><td>3/7</td><td>2/7</td><td>7</td></tr><tr><th>Movement:</th><td>Fl 6 (A)</td><td>15, Fl 3 (A)</td><td>Fl 6 (C)</td><td>9</td><td>1</td><td>Fl 6 (A)</td></tr><tr><th>Hit Dice:</th><td>20</td><td>12 (8)</td><td>8</td><td>2</td><td>14</td><td>3+3</td></tr><tr><th>THAC0:</th><td>5</td><td>9</td><td>13</td><td>19</td><td>7</td><td>17</td></tr><tr><th>No. of Attacks:</th><td>1</td><td>2</td><td>1</td><td>1</td><td>1</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><th>Damage/Attack:</th><td>5-20</td><td>2-8/2-8</td><td>1-6 or by weapon</td><td>1-8 or by weapon</td><td>3-12</td><td>3-18</td></tr><tr><th>Special Attacks:</th><td>Magic</td><td>Magic</td><td>Magic</td><td>Nil</td><td>Magic</td><td>Magic</td></tr><tr><th>Special Defenses:</th><td>Anti-magic</td><td>Nil</td><td>Magic</td><td>Magic</td><td>Magic</td><td>Magic</td></tr><tr><th>Magic Resistance:</th><td>5%</td><td>20%</td><td>25%</td><td>Nil</td><td>35%</td><td>Nil</td></tr><tr><th>Size:</th><td>H (8' in diameter)</td><td>H (8-10' in diameter)</td><td>M (4' in diameter)</td><td>M (5' in diameter)</td><td>H (15' in diameter)</td><td>L (6' in diameter)</td></tr><tr><th>Morale:</th><td>Fanatic (18)</td><td>Fanatic (18)</td><td>Steady (11)</td><td>Elite (14)</td><td>Champion (16)</td><td>Average (10)</td></tr><tr><th>XP Value:</th><td>24,000</td><td>10,000</td><td>6,000</td><td>175</td><td>15,000</td><td>420</td></tr></table><p class=\"f\"><b><img src=\"/img/spc/beholde2.gif\" width=\"300\" height=\"360\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Beholder and Beholder-kin II\" style=\"float:right;\" usemap=\"#map\" title=\"Beholder and Beholder-kin II\">Hive Mother (Beholder-kin)</b></p><p class=\"ni\">The legendary hive mothers are also called the <q>Ultimate tyrants</q>, or just <q>Ultimates</q>. They are twice the size of typical <a href=\"/appendix/beholde1\">beholders</a>, and differ in appearance as well.</p><p>Their mouths are larger, so large that they can gulp down a man-sized target on a natural die roll of 20. Once swallowed, the prey takes 5-20 points of damage (5d4) each round until it is dead or escapes. The beholder's mouth is not very deep, so a victim can escape by making a successful attack roll.</p><p>The ultimate has no eyestalks, but its magical eyes are protected by hooded covers in the flesh of the creature's body, so that they cannot be severed. The central eye has 15 hit points.</p><table class=\"ip\"><tr class=\"bk\"><th>Roll</th><th>Location</th><th>AC</th><th>Hit Points</th></tr><tr><td>01-90</td><td>Body</td><td>0</td><td>20 HD</td></tr><tr><td>91-00</td><td>Central Eye</td><td>7</td><td>15 hp</td></tr></table><p>The ultimate's true ability is in controlling the actions of large numbers of beholders and beholder-kin. A hive mother may have 5-10 ordinary beholders under its command, or 5-20 abomination or beholder-kin (see below), which it communicates with telepathically. A nesting hive mother spells disaster for the surrounding region, as it can apparently create a community of beholders, beholder-kin, and abominations. If destroyed, the beholders and beholder-kin will turn on each other, or seek their own lairs.</p><p>Hive mothers may be the ancestral stock of the better known beholder, the next step of its evolution, a magical mutation, or a separate species. The reality remains unknown.</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Director (Abomination)</b></p><p class=\"ni\">Directors are a social, warrior-beholder, and breed specialized mounts. They mindlink with their mounts to better control them.</p><p>Directors resemble beholders, but their central eye is smaller. They possess only six small eyes on retractable eye stalks. Directors have a fanged mouth below the central eye and possesses three clawed, sensory tendrils on their ventral surface. These tendrils are used to cling to the mount and link with its limited mind.</p><p>Directors' eyes have their own powers:</p><ol><li><i>Magic Missile</i> (as spell , 2/round)</li><li><i>Burning Hands</i> (as spell at 8th level)</li><li><i>Wall of Ice</i> (as spell)</li><li><i>Slow</i> (as spell)</li><li><i>Enervation</i> (as spell)</li><li><i>Improved Phantasmal Force</i> (as spell)</li></ol><p>A director's central eye has the power of deflection - all frontal attacks on director suffer a -2 penalty to the attack roll and damage is halved. The director also gains a +2 bonus to all saving throws against spells cast by those in the field of vision of the central eye.</p><p>Director mounts seem to have derived from an insect stock, as they are covered in chitin and have simple eye spots and multiple limbs.</p><p>Directors normally possess 8 Hit Dice, but when mounted the director and mount are treated as a single creature whose Hit Dice equals the sum of those of the director and the mount. After a director/mount suffers half damage, the mount's speed is reduced to half and the director gets only one physical attack per round. A director may flee and leave his mount to fend for itself (the mount suffers a -4 penalty to its attack rolls). Directors have an AC of 4, but are AC 2 when mounted. Directors may use all of their normal powers while mounted, within the restrictions of beholder targeting angles.</p><p class=\"ni\"><b>Crawler</b> (a typical mount): A crawler resembles a cross between a centipede and a spider. It has 4 Hit Dice. It has 10 legs, two pairs of frontal antennae, and two fighting spider fangs that can be used for separate stabbing attacks causing 2d4 points of damage each. Victims who fail to roll successful saving throws vs. poison are paralyzed for 1d4 rounds. Crawlers are omnivores that prefer to eat smaller creatures. Unmounted, they may roll into a ball to gain an AC of 0. They have cutting mandibles beneath their front fangs.</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Examiner (Abomination)</b></p><p class=\"ni\">An examiner is a 4-foot diameter sphere with no central eye and only four small eyes, each at the end of an antenna, mounted atop the sphere. They have one small, lamprey-like mouth on their ventral surface. The mouth is surrounded by four multi-jointed limbs ending in gripper pads. These limbs can pick up and manipulate tools, the chief strength of the examiner.</p><p>Examiners are scholars and clerks involved in spell and magical item enhancement, research, and creation. They can use any artifact or tool as well as humans, and they can wield up to four items at a time. Examiners regenerate 1 point of damage each round. The powers of their four eyes are given below (all spell-like effects are cast at the 8th level).</p><ol><li><i>Enlarge</i> or <i>Reduce</i></li><li><i>Identify</i> or <i>Legend Lore</i></li><li><i>Transmute Form</i> (similar to a <i>Stone Shape</i> spell, but works on all types of nonmagical, nonliving material)</li><li><i>Spell Reflection</i> as a <i>ring of spell turning</i></li></ol><p>Examiners are not the bravest of beholder-kin, but they are potentially the most dangerous with their command of artifacts. They are often the lackeys of beholders, overseers, and hive mothers.</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Lensman (Abomination)</b></p><p class=\"ni\">A lensman has one eye set in the chest of its five-limbed, starfish-shaped, simian body. Beneath the eye is a leering, toothy maw. Four of the five limbs end in three-fingered, two-thumbed, clawed hands. The fifth limb, atop the body, is a prehensile, whip-like tentacle. Its chitin is soft and there are many short, fly-like hairs. Lensmen are the only kin to wear any sort of garb - a webbing that is used to hold tools and weapons. Their preferred weapons are double-headed pole arms.</p><p>Lensmen are semi-mindless drones that don't question their lot in life. The eye of each lensman possesses only one of the following six special powers (all at the 6th level of ability).</p><ol><li><i>Emotion</i></li><li><i>Heal</i></li><li><i>Dispel Magic</i></li><li><i>Tongues</i></li><li><i>Phantasmal Force</i></li><li><i>Protections</i> (as scrolls, any type, but only one at a time)</li></ol><p class=\"f\"><b>Overseer (Abomination)</b></p><p class=\"ni\">Overseers resemble fleshy trees. They have 13 limbs, each of which ends in a bud that conceals an eye; one of these limbs forms the top spine, and three yammering mouths surround the spine. There are eight thorny, vine-like limbs that are used to grasp tools and for physical defense, inflicting 1d10+2 points of damage each. Overseers sit on root-like bases and can inch along when movement is required. They cannot levitate.</p><p>Overseers are covered with a fungus which changes color as the overseers desire, commonly mottled green, gray, and brown.</p><p>Overseers may use any physical weapons or artifacts. The powers of their 13 eyes are as follows (all magical effects are cast at 14th level).</p><ol><li><i>Cone of Cold</i></li><li><i>Dispel Magic</i></li><li><i>Paralysis</i></li><li><i>Chain Lightning</i></li><li><i>Telekinesis</i> 250 lb. weight</li><li><i>Emotion</i></li><li><i>Mass Charm</i></li><li><i>Domination</i></li><li><i>Mass Suggestion</i></li><li><i>Major Creation</i></li><li><i>Spell Turning</i></li><li><i>Serten's Spell Immunity</i></li><li><i>Temporal Stasis</i></li></ol><p>An overseer's AC is 2, but each eye stalk is AC 7 and is severed if it suffers 10 points of damage. Like hive mothers (that operate with them), overseers can convince similar beholders and beholder-kin to work together. Overseers are very protective of their health and always have one or two beholder guards and at least a half dozen directors protecting their welfare.</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Watcher (Abomination)</b></p><p class=\"ni\">Watchers are 6-foot-diameter spheres with three central eyes arranged around the circumference of the sphere. These eyes are huge and unlidded. On the crown of the sphere is a compound eye and a ring of six eye spots that make it difficult to surprise a watcher. A large tentacle with a barbed prehensile pad extends from the ventral surface, right behind the small mouth with its rasp-like tongue. Watchers feed on carrion and stunned prey. They are information gatherers and are the least brave of all the eye tyrant races.</p><p>Watchers can attack with their single tentacle for 3d6 points of damage. The tentacle also inflicts an electrical shock; victims who fail a system shock roll fall unconscious.</p><p>Each of a watcher's main eyes has two powers, and the compound eye on top may draw on three different abilities. The six eye spots have no special powers.</p><ol><li><i>True Seeing</i> and <i>ESP</i></li><li><i>Advanced Illusion</i> and <i>Demi-Shadow Magic</i></li><li><i>Telekinesis</i> 1,000 lb. and <i>Teleport</i></li></ol><p>Compound Eye: Message, Tongues, and Suggestion</p><p>Watchers are not aggressive warriors; they prefer misdirection and flight to actual confrontation.</p><h2>Other Beholders and Beholder-kin</h2><p class=\"f\">The beholder races are not limited to the ones presented here. The plastic nature of the beholder race allows many mutations and abominations in the breed, including, but not limited to, the following.</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Beholder Mage</b></p><p class=\"ni\">Shunned by other beholders, this is a beholder which has purposely blinded its central eye, so that it might cast spells. It does so by channeling spell energy through an eyestalk, replacing the normal effect with that of a spell of its choice.</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Elder Orb</b></p><p class=\"ni\"><a href=\"/appendix/behoelor\">These</a> are extremely ancient beholders of godlike intelligence and power.
