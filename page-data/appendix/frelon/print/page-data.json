While the powers listed above are the most common, some aarakocra have different or additional powers.</p><p class=\"f\">A race of intelligent, birdlike creatures living in the deepest deserts of Athas, the rare Athasian <a href=\"/appendix/aarakocr\">aarakocra</a> spends its time soaring on thermals in search of food.</p><p>The aarakocra is 7 to 8 feet tall with a wingspan of 20 feet or more. Because of its large wingspan, an aarakocra can carry as much as 75% of its own body weight and still fly easily. An aarakocra can fly a short distance carrying a burden equaling 125% of its own body weight. The average body weight of a full grown male is 100 pounds and a female is 85 pounds.</p><p>Each wing has a &ldquo;hand&rdquo; at its midpoint, consisting of three fingers and an opposable thumb. The fourth finger forms the rigid leading edge of the wing. In flight the hands cannot be used, but on the ground the aarakocra can use its hands almost as a human would. The aarakocra's body is protected by a thin bony plate on the chest, much like a solid rib cage. Talons on its legs can be used as claws and can be retracted to reveal a second set of hands, also with three fingers and an opposable thumb. Except for the chest plate, the entire skeleton is hollow and extremely fragile.</p><p>From a distance, the Athasian aarakocra resembles a huge <a href=\"/appendix/bird\">vulture</a>. Its black eyes, set in the front of the head, provide excellent vision over a long range. The plumage is generally black with a white collar for adult males and black or brown with a smaller white collar for females. Adolescents are a mixture of brown and black. The beak is large and covers most of the head. Plumage begins at the crown of the head and is darker near the head, except for the collar. Athasian aarakocra speak their own language and the languages of vultures and other large birds. Some speak the common tongue (5% to 10% chance depending on how deep in the wastelands a tribe lives).</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Combat:</b> Aarakocra can fight in the air or on the ground. They prefer aerial combat since their bones are too fragile to withstand a solid blow from a human-sized opponent. In combat against creatures on the ground, they prefer to fly over their victim and drop weighted nets. Some aarakocra use darts to harass ground-based opponents.</p><p>If their opponents can fly, the aarakocra generally forgo the use of the net, although large groups sometimes use nets on flying creatures. Normally, aarakocra attack flying creatures with long spears, diving from above and allowing the momentum to carry the spear through the target. Such an attack doubles the damage if the aarakocra have been able to dive at least 50 feet. Only the very largest aarakocra can carry more than one of these spears, they can attack with both at once with no penalty, causing double damage on each strike. All diving attacks are made at +4 and should be treated as a charge attack. All other penalties and restrictions of charge attacks apply.</p><p>The effect of the aarakocra's nets depends on if the opponent is flying at the time it becomes entangled. Creatures on the ground that are hit by a net are entangled and unable to participate in any combat until they make a successful Strength check to get free of the net. Flying creatures hit by a net can no longer fly and immediately begin falling. If they cannot escape the net or use some magical means to arrest the fall, normal falling damage applies.</p><p>Unless victims are entangled in nets, aarakocra are cautious in ground combat. If the aarakocra outnumber their opponents they advance in a straight line and thrust with their spears. If outnumbered, or the opponents are particularly tough, the aarakocra withdraw. Victims entangled in nets are killed or incapacitated for use as food or ransom.</p><p>Athasian aarakocra are mindful of their physical limitations as well as their comparatively low psionic abilities. They do not normally initiate psionic combat. At the first sign of psionic powers from any of their victims, however, all aarakocra that have some ability will use whatever attack and defense modes they can in an attempt to destroy the threat. Large groups of is or more aarakocra may initiate psionic combat if their leaders feel they can win quickly and avoid physical combat.</p><p>In desperation, an aarakocra can attempt to bite an opponent in combat. Because of the unwieldiness of its beak, the aarakocra has a THAC0 of 18 if attacking with this appendage. Further, the birdman causes only 1d2 points of damage with the beak.</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Habitat/Society:</b> Athasian aarakocra live in tribes with 6-20 (2d8+4) members, depending on the prestige of the leader. The largest tribe ever recorded had 50 members. The tribal hunting territory depends on the size of the tribe, usually about 500 square miles for a tribe of 10 members. There are no rigid boundaries between tribes and border disputes are not uncommon.</p><p>Alignments of tribe members are similar to the alignment of the leader. A tribe that has a leader who is neutral good may have neutral good, chaotic good, lawful good, and true neutral members. A predominantly evil tribe does not recognize boundaries with other tribes and treats other tribes as inferior beings to be eliminated.</p><p>Athasian aarakocra aren't happy in enclosed spaces, but they they take refuge in a cave or building if necessary.</p><p>Nonevil tribes live in rocky aeries in the highest peaks they can find. Evil tribes are normally nomadic and use an aerie made by another tribe if they need to remain in an area for a long time, even if they have to evict the tribe that made the nest.</p><p>Aarakocra aren't friendly toward intruders in their territory, especially caravans. They try to extract a toll from the caravan for passage through the desert. Good-aligned tribes allow unhindered passage of caravans that pay a tribute. If someone refuses to pay the tribute, the aarakocra try to capture scouts or outriders from the party and hold them until an even larger tribute is paid. The payment may be either livestock or shiny objects. Aarakocra are smart enough not to be taken in by glass baubles instead of gems, although they cannot tell the difference between the more common gems and the rare ones.</p><p>Evil tribes ask for tribute and often attack a caravan whether it pays or not. Aarakocra always demand shiny objects such as stones. These tribes find humans and demihumans to be quite tasty and prefer them to other food.</p><p>Good-aligned tribes of aarakocra sometimes return a lost traveler to the edge of the desert after first removing any valuables the traveler may be carrying. On very rare occasions a tribe might return a lost group of travelers to the more frequently traveled parts of the desert, again after first taking any valuables as payment.</p><p>The oldest male is the leader of the tribal hunting party and has 4+4 Hit Dice. The oldest female is in charge of the tribal aerie and has 3+3 HD. In tribes that have more than 15 members, the next oldest aarakocra serves as shaman and has 3+3 HD; the shaman completes the triumvirate necessary for proper worship and the summoning of elementals. (Interestingly, no magic-using aarakocra has ever been recorded.) Tribes without a shaman cannot summon <a href=\"/appendix/element1\">air elementals</a>, which is an important part of aarakocra culture.</p><p>The shaman is the leader of the daily sun worship. Aarakocra worship the sun because it provides them with the thermals they need to soar in search of food. The shaman also leads the mystic rituals used to summon an air elemental. Summoning an air elemental is usually done only in preparation for the tribe's most sacred ceremony, the hunt. Small tribes must band together for this ceremony to allow the triumvirate to be formed.</p><p>The ceremony to summon an air elemental must be conducted at dawn and requires the oldest male and female to emit a highpitched keening whistle. The shaman conducts an intricate dance around them, simultaneously chanting an ancient summoning mantra.</p><p>The hunt is the final part of the initiation of adolescent aarakocra to adulthood and often takes the tribe far from their normal teritory. The target is always a <a href=\"/appendix/drakalsi\">silt drake</a>. The hunt is the only time the females leave the relative safety of the nest. Even an evil tribe will not interfere with a tribe on a hunt. An air elemental is often summoned to help find the drake, but never takes part in the actual combat. Although the adult members of the tribe take part in the initial phases of the combat, it is the initiates who deliver the final, killing blows to me drake. Scars from the hunt are considered a mark of pride among all aarakocra.</p><p>The females spend about eight months of the year incubating their eggs. Athasian aarakocra mate for life and a pair normally produces as many as 10 offspring. A female lays one egg a year. Constant incubation is not required because of the high daytime temperatures, so the females can maintain the nest and keep the tribe's treasure in order.</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Ecology:</b> Athasian aarakocra are high on the food chain and have no natural enemies other than <a href=\"/appendix/drakatha\">drakes</a>. Unless evil, aarakocra leave their own territory only to hunt the silt drake and return as soon as possible when the hunt is over. (Evil aarakocra attack others, as noted above.) Aarakocra eggs and hatchlings are sought after by wealthy land owners who wish to use the creatures as scouts and sentries. An egg can bring as much as 10 cp in Tyr's marketplace. Tribes that have had eggs or hatchlings stolen have long memories and sometimes take revenge against the thief at a later date. Captive aarakocra join any tribe they come in contact with.</p><p>Athasian aarakocra have a natural life span of 21-30 years.</p>\n","images":["<img src=\"grf/ds.gif\" width=\"150\" height=\"75\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Dark Sun\" title=\"Dark Sun\" align=\"right\">","<img src=\"img/aarakath.gif\" alt=\"Aarakocra (Athas)\" title=\"Aarakocra (Athas)\" border=\"0\" width=\"300\" height=\"360\" style=\"text-align:right;\" align=\"right\">","<img src=\"grf/add2_01.gif\" width=\"200\" height=\"56\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Advanced Dungeons & Dragons 2nd Edition\">"],"setting":"Dark Sun","statblock":{"Aarakocra (Athas)":{"Activity Cycle":"Day","Alignment":"Any","Armor Class":"7","Climate/Terrain":"Deep desert","Damage/Attack":"1d3/1d3 or by weapon","Diet":"Carnivore","Frequency":"Rare","Hit Dice":"2+2","Intelligence":"Average (8-10)","Magic Resistance":"Nil","Morale":"Steady (11)","Movement":"6, Fl 36 (C)","No. Appearing":"1d10","No. of Attacks":"2","Organization":"Tribal","Size":"M (20'+ wingspan)","Special Attacks":"Nil","Special Defenses":"Nil","THAC0":"17","Treasure":"Varies","XP Value":"65"}},"title":"Aarakocra (Athas)"},"sources":["2433"],"statblock_names":[],"title":"Aarakocra (Athas)","prev_key":"zygraat","next_key":"aarakocr","monster_path":"/appendix/aarakath"}}},"pageContext":{"monster_key":"frelon","monster_data":{"TSR":["2524"],"fullBody":"  <table cellspacing=\"0\" cellpadding=\"0\"><tr><th>Climate/Terrain:</th><td>Temperate forests and hills</td></tr><tr><th>Frequency:</th><td>Very rare</td></tr><tr><th>Organization:</th><td>Solitary</td></tr><tr><th>Activity Cycle:</th><td>Any</td></tr><tr><th>Diet:</th><td>Carnivore</td></tr><tr><th>Intelligence:</th><td>Average (8-10)</td></tr><tr><th>Treasure:</th><td>Nil</td></tr><tr><th>Alignment:</th><td>Chaotic evil</td></tr><tr><th>No. Appearing:</th><td>1d4</td></tr><tr><th>Armor Class:</th><td>3</td></tr><tr><th>Movement:</th><td>8, Fl 18 (C)</td></tr><tr><th>Hit Dice:</th><td>6+3</td></tr><tr><th>THAC0:</th><td>13</td></tr><tr><th>No. of Attacks:</th><td>4</td></tr><tr><th>Damage/Attack:</th><td>1d4/1d4/2d6/1d6</td></tr><tr><th>Special Attacks:</th><td>Poison</td></tr><tr><th>Special Defenses:</th><td>Nil</td></tr><tr><th>Magic Resistance:</th><td>10%</td></tr><tr><th>Size:</th><td>L (7' tall)</td></tr><tr><th>Morale:</th><td>Fanatic (17-18)</td></tr><tr><th>XP Value:</th><td>2,000</td></tr></table><p class=\"f\">The frelôn were originally created by <a href=\"/appendix/dragscoa\">dragons</a> to serve a specific function: to seek and destroy the hated <a href=\"/appendix/aranea\">araneas</a>. They have since grown beyond this function, evolving into mysterious, yet very dangerous, creatures.</p><p>A frelôn looks like a cross between a dragon and a wasp. Its long, skinny body segments into two sections, though not quite the abdomen-and-thorax arrangement of a normal insect. Two pairs of long legs cause it to stand upright at 7 feet tall. A whiplike tail with a stinger extends from the base of the body, constantly snaking about as if restless to attack. The creature's upper pair of arms end in small claws that are capable of raking attacks and grasping small objects. The dragonlike head seems small for such a large creature, but its dangerous mouth is filled with a double row of tiny but sharp teeth. Head to tail, the creature is armored with mostly black scales, though it usually has several decorative bands of red or blue circling its lower body or running in striped patterns on the upper body and head. The frelôn possesses a set of wings, similar to those of a <a href=\"/appendix/drgnfly\">dragonfly</a>. These semi-transparent wings shimmer with a hint of reflected color.</p><p>Frelôns communicate with each other through buzzes, hums, and clicks. They also share an abbreviated language with all evil dragons and can still make themselves understood to the descendants of their creators.</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Combat:</b> The frelôn attacks mostly for food. It has grown fond of the taste of human and demihuman flesh and eats it as often as possible. The creature prefers aerial combat, where it can wrap its tail underneath and use all four attacks. However, a frelôn cannot attack creatures on the ground without landing first, because of its size and slow maneuverability. On the ground, the frelôn attacks with its forward claws and its bite. If fighting multiple opponents, the frelôn will fly off with the first one to fall. If the frelôn loses over half of its hit points, it will attempt to flee.</p><p>If the frelôn is attacking for the purpose of its created function, if it decides to flee, or if a victim proves too tenacious and the frelôn cannot escape, the creature will rely on its stinging attack. The frelôn will turn sideways, so it may attack its victim with one claw as well as the stinger. If multiple creatures attack the frelôn at melee range, the frelôn will always attack the first with conventional attack methods and the second with its stinger. The effects of the sting attack are described below. After a successful sting attack, the frelôn will withdraw from combat, flying to safety.</p><p>The frelôn can fly 180 feet per round. It cannot ascend more steeply than 45 degrees, moving 90 feet forward and 90 feet up. Descending, the frelôn can move 180 feet both forward and down. Because the frelôn's flight is magical, it can lift up to 200 pounds without penalty, and it can carry up to a maximum of 400 pounds at half its Movement Rate and a maneuverability class of D. The creature's wings also magically regenerate. Even if the wings are completely destroyed, the frelôn regains them within three turns. This regeneration does not heal lost hit points; it just allows use of the wings. Unlike other creatures, the frelôn can fly regardless of hit point damage to its body.</p><p>The sting of a frelôn produces several effects. Besides suffering 1d6 points of damage, any sting victim must make a successful saving throw vs. poison or fall unconscious for 2d4 rounds and suffer 1d4 turns of memory loss. After a successful sting attack, the frelôn always abandons the victim, even if hunting. This is because the stinger also acts as a syringe, inserting tiny eggs into the wound. Unless high-level magic (<i>heal</i>, <i>limited wish</i>, etc.) is used to immediately treat the wound, a young frelôn will eventually emerge and fly away. As most victims do not remember the frelôn attack due to memory loss, they rarely seek the help they need. Frelôns can inject their poison and eggs only once every two days.</p><p>Frelôn young begin to hatch after two weeks. For the next week, the victim suffers the loss of 1 hit point per day, as several of the tiny young feed on their host and each other. By the second week, only one frelôn is left, but its continued feeding causes the loss of 2 hit points per day. This loss accompanies waves of nausea and muscle pains as if the victim has contracted a disease or a case of food poisoning. During and after the second week, the surviving frelôn can influence its host as per a domination spell once every 24 hours. During the third and fourth weeks, the creature limits itself to only 1 hit point every few days (as if the victim might be getting better) though the nausea and muscle spasms will increase slightly.</p><p>The young frelôn can actually live in its host for up to one month before emerging for other nourishment. Its emergence forces the victim to attempt a saving throw vs. death magic. Failure indicates death, while success limits the effect to 4d8 points of damage. The emergence wound must be treated for disease and magically healed within 48 hours, or the victim will fall ill, dying within one week unless a <i>wish</i> or <i>regenerate</i> spell is used.</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Habitat/Society:</b> When fighting the araneas, the dragons created a new life form to be the bane of this spider race. They stripped away a part of themselves (and borrowed from a few other creatures) to create the frelôn. They endowed this predatory creature with the desire to seek and destroy the araneas, the Intelligence needed for both surviving in this harsh land and finding the reclusive spider people, and the natural abilities that make the frelôn a deadly hunter. The frelôns were designed as solitary creatures to make destroying large numbers of them at a time almost impossible. Each creature reaches maturity within six months and can then lay eggs, hopefully in an aranea. No mate is required for reproduction. The <i>domination</i> ability is for forcing a host to lead the frelôn to other araneas.</p><p>Frelôns threatened aranean settlements for centuries. For quite a bit of that time, the araneas were not even sure what danger they faced. However, when the Immortal patron of the dragons retired from the Conflict, the araneas again possessed a superior wealth of magic.</p><p>The araneas also discovered a weakness in the single-minded directive given to the frelôn that they were able to exploit. The dragons had not counted on the dual nature of the araneas. By revealing the aranean humanoid aspect to the frelôns, the araneas managed to confuse them and divert a majority of the threat. In an effort to fulfill their mission of destruction, the frelôns began to hunt all humanoid creatures.</p><p>This change of focus spread the frelôns throughout the lands of the Savage Coast and into surrounding areas. Even as far as the Arm of the Immortals, the <a href=\"/appendix/eeaar\">ee'aar</a> were forced to launch a major campaign to eradicate the frelôn presence there. As the creatures spread, the araneas were also able to bring the menace under some semblance of control in Herath.</p><p>Today, frelôns seek the destruction of all humanoid races in their search for araneas. They do not care for treasure or power, taking only what they need to survive. At times they ally with nonhumanoid, intelligent creatures.</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Ecology:</b> The frelôns prey on humanoid races of any type, affecting the ecology at one of the highest levels possible. Their Intelligence makes them very dangerous foes. One frelôn, in the absence of any true opposition, can decimate a small village by attacking a few remote homes and planting eggs. Within a few months, dozens of young frelôns swarm the surrounding countryside.</p><p>At this point, it is unlikely that the dragons could stop this experiment gone awry, and it is unsure whether they would even want to. Crimson dragons have actually been known to convince frelôns to join them as guardians and servants. Lucky for the humanoid races, the frelôns still remain separate from one another, as they were originally designed. If they were to begin constructing social ties and communities, working together toward their common goal, their power would multiply accordingly.</p><p>Fortunately, the races are aware that the frelôn pose a threat to their lives. Larger cities usually post a bounty on the creatures. Wizards, alchemists and priests will pay well for frelôn body parts because of their usefulness in a variety of magical preparations. Some of the creature's smaller scales are necessary for <i>crimson essence</i>. Pieces of the creature's wings can be brewed into a <i>potion of flying</i>. Potions of <i>domination</i> can be formed from the frelôn's brain, if the frelôn is caught young enough.</p><p>Some parts of the creature do not even require enchantment to be of benefit. The poison from one frelôn is enough to coat a blade three times or an arrow six times. One dose will cause paralysis for 1d4 rounds, negated by a successful saving throw vs. poison. Some frelôns (25%) possess 5d4 scales which will each act as one ounce of <i>cinnabryl</i>, depleting in the normal fashion. These are formed when a young frelôn is exposed to the magical interaction between cinnabryl and someone possessing a Legacy. These scales are usually the colored ones up around the head. Once they are depleted, they are of no further use.</p>\n","images":["<img src=\"grf/rs.gif\" width=\"150\" height=\"75\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Red Steel (Mystara)\" title=\"Red Steel (Mystara)\" align=\"right\">","<img src=\"img/frelon.gif\" alt=\"Frelôn\" title=\"Frelôn\" border=\"0\" width=\"300\" height=\"360\" style=\"text-align:right;\" align=\"right\">","<img src=\"grf/add2_01.gif\" width=\"200\" height=\"56\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Advanced Dungeons & Dragons 2nd Edition\">"],"setting":"Red Steel (Mystara)","statblock":{"Frelôn":{"Activity Cycle":"Any","Alignment":"Chaotic evil","Armor Class":"3","Climate/Terrain":"Temperate forests and hills","Damage/Attack":"1d4/1d4/2d6/1d6","Diet":"Carnivore","Frequency":"Very rare","Hit Dice":"6+3","Intelligence":"Average (8-10)","Magic Resistance":"10%","Morale":"Fanatic (17-18)","Movement":"8, Fl 18 (C)","No. Appearing":"1d4","No. of Attacks":"4","Organization":"Solitary","Size":"L (7' tall)","Special Attacks":"Poison","Special Defenses":"Nil","THAC0":"13","Treasure":"Nil","XP Value":"2,000"}},"title":"Frelôn"},"sources":["2524"],"statblock_names":[],"title":"Frelôn","prev_key":"fractine","next_key":"frog","monster_path":"/appendix/frelon"}},"staticQueryHashes":[],"slicesMap":{}}
