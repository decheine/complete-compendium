While the powers listed above are the most common, some aarakocra have different or additional powers.</p><p class=\"f\">A race of intelligent, birdlike creatures living in the deepest deserts of Athas, the rare Athasian <a href=\"/appendix/aarakocr\">aarakocra</a> spends its time soaring on thermals in search of food.</p><p>The aarakocra is 7 to 8 feet tall with a wingspan of 20 feet or more. Because of its large wingspan, an aarakocra can carry as much as 75% of its own body weight and still fly easily. An aarakocra can fly a short distance carrying a burden equaling 125% of its own body weight. The average body weight of a full grown male is 100 pounds and a female is 85 pounds.</p><p>Each wing has a &ldquo;hand&rdquo; at its midpoint, consisting of three fingers and an opposable thumb. The fourth finger forms the rigid leading edge of the wing. In flight the hands cannot be used, but on the ground the aarakocra can use its hands almost as a human would. The aarakocra's body is protected by a thin bony plate on the chest, much like a solid rib cage. Talons on its legs can be used as claws and can be retracted to reveal a second set of hands, also with three fingers and an opposable thumb. Except for the chest plate, the entire skeleton is hollow and extremely fragile.</p><p>From a distance, the Athasian aarakocra resembles a huge <a href=\"/appendix/bird\">vulture</a>. Its black eyes, set in the front of the head, provide excellent vision over a long range. The plumage is generally black with a white collar for adult males and black or brown with a smaller white collar for females. Adolescents are a mixture of brown and black. The beak is large and covers most of the head. Plumage begins at the crown of the head and is darker near the head, except for the collar. Athasian aarakocra speak their own language and the languages of vultures and other large birds. Some speak the common tongue (5% to 10% chance depending on how deep in the wastelands a tribe lives).</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Combat:</b> Aarakocra can fight in the air or on the ground. They prefer aerial combat since their bones are too fragile to withstand a solid blow from a human-sized opponent. In combat against creatures on the ground, they prefer to fly over their victim and drop weighted nets. Some aarakocra use darts to harass ground-based opponents.</p><p>If their opponents can fly, the aarakocra generally forgo the use of the net, although large groups sometimes use nets on flying creatures. Normally, aarakocra attack flying creatures with long spears, diving from above and allowing the momentum to carry the spear through the target. Such an attack doubles the damage if the aarakocra have been able to dive at least 50 feet. Only the very largest aarakocra can carry more than one of these spears, they can attack with both at once with no penalty, causing double damage on each strike. All diving attacks are made at +4 and should be treated as a charge attack. All other penalties and restrictions of charge attacks apply.</p><p>The effect of the aarakocra's nets depends on if the opponent is flying at the time it becomes entangled. Creatures on the ground that are hit by a net are entangled and unable to participate in any combat until they make a successful Strength check to get free of the net. Flying creatures hit by a net can no longer fly and immediately begin falling. If they cannot escape the net or use some magical means to arrest the fall, normal falling damage applies.</p><p>Unless victims are entangled in nets, aarakocra are cautious in ground combat. If the aarakocra outnumber their opponents they advance in a straight line and thrust with their spears. If outnumbered, or the opponents are particularly tough, the aarakocra withdraw. Victims entangled in nets are killed or incapacitated for use as food or ransom.</p><p>Athasian aarakocra are mindful of their physical limitations as well as their comparatively low psionic abilities. They do not normally initiate psionic combat. At the first sign of psionic powers from any of their victims, however, all aarakocra that have some ability will use whatever attack and defense modes they can in an attempt to destroy the threat. Large groups of is or more aarakocra may initiate psionic combat if their leaders feel they can win quickly and avoid physical combat.</p><p>In desperation, an aarakocra can attempt to bite an opponent in combat. Because of the unwieldiness of its beak, the aarakocra has a THAC0 of 18 if attacking with this appendage. Further, the birdman causes only 1d2 points of damage with the beak.</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Habitat/Society:</b> Athasian aarakocra live in tribes with 6-20 (2d8+4) members, depending on the prestige of the leader. The largest tribe ever recorded had 50 members. The tribal hunting territory depends on the size of the tribe, usually about 500 square miles for a tribe of 10 members. There are no rigid boundaries between tribes and border disputes are not uncommon.</p><p>Alignments of tribe members are similar to the alignment of the leader. A tribe that has a leader who is neutral good may have neutral good, chaotic good, lawful good, and true neutral members. A predominantly evil tribe does not recognize boundaries with other tribes and treats other tribes as inferior beings to be eliminated.</p><p>Athasian aarakocra aren't happy in enclosed spaces, but they they take refuge in a cave or building if necessary.</p><p>Nonevil tribes live in rocky aeries in the highest peaks they can find. Evil tribes are normally nomadic and use an aerie made by another tribe if they need to remain in an area for a long time, even if they have to evict the tribe that made the nest.</p><p>Aarakocra aren't friendly toward intruders in their territory, especially caravans. They try to extract a toll from the caravan for passage through the desert. Good-aligned tribes allow unhindered passage of caravans that pay a tribute. If someone refuses to pay the tribute, the aarakocra try to capture scouts or outriders from the party and hold them until an even larger tribute is paid. The payment may be either livestock or shiny objects. Aarakocra are smart enough not to be taken in by glass baubles instead of gems, although they cannot tell the difference between the more common gems and the rare ones.</p><p>Evil tribes ask for tribute and often attack a caravan whether it pays or not. Aarakocra always demand shiny objects such as stones. These tribes find humans and demihumans to be quite tasty and prefer them to other food.</p><p>Good-aligned tribes of aarakocra sometimes return a lost traveler to the edge of the desert after first removing any valuables the traveler may be carrying. On very rare occasions a tribe might return a lost group of travelers to the more frequently traveled parts of the desert, again after first taking any valuables as payment.</p><p>The oldest male is the leader of the tribal hunting party and has 4+4 Hit Dice. The oldest female is in charge of the tribal aerie and has 3+3 HD. In tribes that have more than 15 members, the next oldest aarakocra serves as shaman and has 3+3 HD; the shaman completes the triumvirate necessary for proper worship and the summoning of elementals. (Interestingly, no magic-using aarakocra has ever been recorded.) Tribes without a shaman cannot summon <a href=\"/appendix/element1\">air elementals</a>, which is an important part of aarakocra culture.</p><p>The shaman is the leader of the daily sun worship. Aarakocra worship the sun because it provides them with the thermals they need to soar in search of food. The shaman also leads the mystic rituals used to summon an air elemental. Summoning an air elemental is usually done only in preparation for the tribe's most sacred ceremony, the hunt. Small tribes must band together for this ceremony to allow the triumvirate to be formed.</p><p>The ceremony to summon an air elemental must be conducted at dawn and requires the oldest male and female to emit a highpitched keening whistle. The shaman conducts an intricate dance around them, simultaneously chanting an ancient summoning mantra.</p><p>The hunt is the final part of the initiation of adolescent aarakocra to adulthood and often takes the tribe far from their normal teritory. The target is always a <a href=\"/appendix/drakalsi\">silt drake</a>. The hunt is the only time the females leave the relative safety of the nest. Even an evil tribe will not interfere with a tribe on a hunt. An air elemental is often summoned to help find the drake, but never takes part in the actual combat. Although the adult members of the tribe take part in the initial phases of the combat, it is the initiates who deliver the final, killing blows to me drake. Scars from the hunt are considered a mark of pride among all aarakocra.</p><p>The females spend about eight months of the year incubating their eggs. Athasian aarakocra mate for life and a pair normally produces as many as 10 offspring. A female lays one egg a year. Constant incubation is not required because of the high daytime temperatures, so the females can maintain the nest and keep the tribe's treasure in order.</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Ecology:</b> Athasian aarakocra are high on the food chain and have no natural enemies other than <a href=\"/appendix/drakatha\">drakes</a>. Unless evil, aarakocra leave their own territory only to hunt the silt drake and return as soon as possible when the hunt is over. (Evil aarakocra attack others, as noted above.) Aarakocra eggs and hatchlings are sought after by wealthy land owners who wish to use the creatures as scouts and sentries. An egg can bring as much as 10 cp in Tyr's marketplace. Tribes that have had eggs or hatchlings stolen have long memories and sometimes take revenge against the thief at a later date. Captive aarakocra join any tribe they come in contact with.</p><p>Athasian aarakocra have a natural life span of 21-30 years.</p><br clear=\"all\" style=\"clear:both; height:0;\">\r\n","images":["<img src=\"grf/ds.gif\" width=\"150\" height=\"75\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Dark Sun\" title=\"Dark Sun\" align=\"right\">","<img src=\"img/aarakath.gif\" alt=\"Aarakocra (Athas)\" title=\"Aarakocra (Athas)\" border=\"0\" width=\"300\" height=\"360\" style=\"text-align:right;\" align=\"right\">","<img src=\"grf/add2_01.gif\" width=\"200\" height=\"56\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Advanced Dungeons & Dragons 2nd Edition\">"],"setting":"Dark Sun","statblock":{"Aarakocra (Athas)":{"Activity Cycle":"Day","Alignment":"Any","Armor Class":"7","Climate/Terrain":"Deep desert","Damage/Attack":"1d3/1d3 or by weapon","Diet":"Carnivore","Frequency":"Rare","Hit Dice":"2+2","Intelligence":"Average (8-10)","Magic Resistance":"Nil","Morale":"Steady (11)","Movement":"6, Fl 36 (C)","No. Appearing":"1d10","No. of Attacks":"2","Organization":"Tribal","Size":"M (20'+ wingspan)","Special Attacks":"Nil","Special Defenses":"Nil","THAC0":"17","Treasure":"Varies","XP Value":"65"}},"title":"Aarakocra (Athas)"},"sources":["2433"],"statblock_names":[],"title":"Aarakocra (Athas)","prev_key":"zygraat","next_key":"aarakocr","monster_path":"/appendix/aarakath"}}},"pageContext":{"monster_key":"spirwall","monster_data":{"TSR":["2524"],"fullBody":"  <table cellspacing=\"0\" cellpadding=\"0\"><tr class=\"bk\"><th> </th><th class=\"cn\">Kangaroo</th><th class=\"cn\">Koala</th><th class=\"cn\">Kookaburra</th></tr><tr><th>Climate/Terrain:</th><td>Dreamlands</td><td>Dreamlands</td><td>Dreamlands</td></tr><tr><th>Frequency:</th><td>Very rare</td><td>Very rare</td><td>Very rare</td></tr><tr><th>Organization:</th><td>Solitary</td><td>Solitary</td><td>Solitary</td></tr><tr><th>Activity Cycle:</th><td>Any</td><td>Any</td><td>Nocturnal</td></tr><tr><th>Diet:</th><td>Nil</td><td>Nil</td><td>Nil</td></tr><tr><th>Intelligence:</th><td>Supra-Genius (19-20)</td><td>Supra-Genius (19-20)</td><td>Supra-Genius (19-20)</td></tr><tr><th>Treasure:</th><td>Nil</td><td>Nil</td><td>Nil</td></tr><tr><th>Alignment:</th><td>Neutral or good, usually lawful</td><td>Neutral or good, usually lawful</td><td>Neutral or good, usually lawful</td></tr><tr><th>No. Appearing:</th><td>1</td><td>1</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><th>Armor Class:</th><td>0</td><td>0</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><th>Movement:</th><td>18</td><td>6</td><td>6, Fly 18 (A)</td></tr><tr><th>Hit Dice:</th><td>10</td><td>10</td><td>10</td></tr><tr><th>THAC0:</th><td>11</td><td>11</td><td>11</td></tr><tr><th>No. of Attacks:</th><td>3</td><td>1</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><th>Damage/Attack:</th><td>1d3/1d3/2d4</td><td>1d2</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><th>Special Attacks:</th><td>Nil</td><td>Nil</td><td>Nil</td></tr><tr><th>Special Defenses:</th><td>See below</td><td>See below</td><td>See below</td></tr><tr><th>Magic Resistance:</th><td>95%</td><td>95%</td><td>95%</td></tr><tr><th>Size:</th><td>M (5' tall)</td><td>S (2&#189;' tall)</td><td>T (18&rdquo; tall)</td></tr><tr><th>Morale:</th><td>Special</td><td>Special</td><td>Special</td></tr><tr><th>XP Value:</th><td>1,000</td><td>1,000</td><td>1,000</td></tr></table><p class=\"f\">Wallaran spirits are dream-world creatures of the Wallaroo grasslands that function as spirit guides and totems to the <a href=\"/appendix/wallara\">wallaras</a>. Wallaran spirits do not inhabit the waking world and will never be found there. Their domain is exclusively the Dreamworld, the world occasionally visited by sleeping mortals when they have a dream that is so detailed it is difficult to tell apart from reality.</p><p>Wallaran spirits take the form of various animals from the wallaran grasslands. Many different types exist, but three of the most common forms are the kangaroo, the koala, and the kookaburra. Each animal totem has specific abilities and areas of influence, which are discussed below.</p><p>Wallaran spirits speak directly to the dreaming mind. They can even speak with nonwallaras if they want to.</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Combat:</b> Combat with a wallaran spirit creature would be a tricky affair at best, although it is theoretically possible. These spirit creatures appear only in the Dreamworld, where they are masters of reality. Any mortal who sees one of these creatures must be asleep and dreaming. If a dreaming creature attempts to attack a wallaran spirit, the spirit either disappears or the attackers may find that they are suddenly wielding something other than their weapons (such as eucalyptus leaves or pieces of fruit).</p><p>So great is the spirit-creature's control of the Dreamworld that spellcasters who attempt to confront a wallaran spirit creature in the Dreamworld will find that their spells simply do not work about 95% of the time.</p><p>Wallaran spirits may be hit only by magical weapons that are physically present in the Dreamworld, which is almost impossible. People get to the Dreamworld by dreaming, and anything they have with them in the Dreamworld is merely a reflection of the item, not the real item. To fight a wallaran spirit, the characters would have to find a way to physically travel to the Dreamworld.</p><p>A wallaran spirit can impose its will on anyone that visits the Dreamworld. The wallaran spirit effectively has the spell-casting abilities of an 18th-level mage, but it can activate its spells at will, with no casting times or components. It rarely uses offensive, damage-causing spells. If confronted by a violent attacker, the wallaran spirit would use a <i>polymorph other</i> to change the attacker into a nonthreatening, peaceful creature.A creature that has a peaceful dream-encounter with a wallaran spirit receives the 1,000 experience points. No experience points are awarded for fighting a wallaran spirit.</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Habitat/Society:</b> Wallaran philosophy states that two worlds exist: the waking world, and the Dreamworld. The wallaras are not sure which world is more real.</p><p>In the Dreamlands, wallaran spirits appear only in the deepest of dreams. The spirit will usually give a bit of cryptic advice, sometimes in the form of a vision, poem, euphemism, or riddle. When the advice has been given, something happens to cause a distraction (a noise or rustling in the Dreamworld underbrush), and then the spirit creature disappears. The spirit creature usually leaves the dreamer with a sign in the real world that the vision was true, such as a eucalyptus leaf, feather, or a bit of sand.</p><p>These Dreamworld creatures may or may not have a society of their own, but they do have a significant effect on wallaran society. Individual wallaras with the same spirit-creature guide identify with the totem animal and see themselves as part of a group. All wallaras with a kangaroo guide, for example, will regard each other as brothers.</p><p>Most wallaras see their spirit guide at two periods during their life: during their walkabout and when they are about to die. Each time, the spirit guide gives the wallara some advice or reassurance about what is to come.</p><p>Wallaran priests, or mendoo, see their spirit guides often and have complex relationships with their totems. The spirit guide is regarded as a companion, helper, and teacher.</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Ecology:</b> Each wallara is prohibited from killing, eating, touching, or harming the animal that has the shape of his spirit guide. The wallaran taboo against killing these animals acts as a conservation device.</p><p>Legends state that once the wallaras were wise and powerful, walking with the gods themselves. It is possible that the wallaran spirits of today are actually some of those ancient wallaras, attempting to aid their fallen brethren.</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Kangaroo</b></p><p class=\"ni\">Kangaroos are ordinarily quite timid, but they are dangerous when angered, pummeling attackers with their forepaws and slashing with their powerful hind legs. The long, muscular tail is used as a support when the animal sits or walks and for balance when it leaps. Kangaroos are usually gray or dull red in color.</p><p>Wallaras who have a kangaroo spirit-guide are the closest thing to warriors that can be found in the peaceful wallaran society. Wallaras of the kangaroo totem are prone to action and are considered hasty by wallaran standards.</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Koala</b></p><p class=\"ni\">The koala reaches a maximum length of about two and a half feet. It has a large, round head, a vestigial tail, and a stout body covered with thick, ash-gray fur. Its legs are short, and its feet are large. Koalas live high in eucalyptus trees, feeding only on the leaves and flowers of a certain species of eucalyptus. They are lethargic and often remain in the same tree for days. A koala will not relax its hold on a tree, even when it is mortally wounded.</p><p>Wallaras with a koala as a spirit guide are sedentary by nature. They are primarily concerned with providing food for the community. These wallaras are extremely loyal, peaceful, and contemplative.</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Kookaburra</b></p><p class=\"ni\">The kookaburra is stocky grayish bird in the <a href=\"/appendix/birdkryn\">kingfisher</a> family. It is about 18 inches long. It has a loud, raucous call, which inspired its common nickname of &ldquo;laughing jackass&rdquo;. It rarely catches fish, living mainly on large insects, mice, small birds, and snakes.</p><p>Wallaras who see the kookaburra have a dual nature. These wallaras are about as deceptive and tricky as a wallara can get. They tend to be jokers and pranksters. They are outgoing and often act as a contact with outsiders. Kookaburra-wallaras are also the ones that are primarily responsible for rearing wallaran children, since they are friendly and interact well with youngsters. The wallaras take these duties very seriously and will never abandon a child. These wallaras will also join with the kangaroo-wallaras to help defend their communities if necessary.</p><br clear=\"all\" style=\"clear:both; height:0;\">\r\n","images":["<img src=\"grf/rs.gif\" width=\"150\" height=\"75\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Red Steel (Mystara)\" title=\"Red Steel (Mystara)\" align=\"right\">","<img src=\"img/spirwall.gif\" alt=\"Spirit, Walleran\" title=\"Spirit, Walleran\" border=\"0\" width=\"300\" height=\"360\" style=\"text-align:right;\" align=\"right\">","<img src=\"grf/add2_01.gif\" width=\"200\" height=\"56\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Advanced Dungeons & Dragons 2nd Edition\">"],"setting":"Red Steel (Mystara)","statblock":{"Kangaroo":{"Activity Cycle":"Any","Alignment":"Neutral or good, usually lawful","Armor Class":"0","Climate/Terrain":"Dreamlands","Damage/Attack":"1d3/1d3/2d4","Diet":"Nil","Frequency":"Very rare","Hit Dice":"10","Intelligence":"Supra-Genius (19-20)","Magic Resistance":"95%","Morale":"Special","Movement":"18","No. Appearing":"1","No. of Attacks":"3","Organization":"Solitary","Size":"M (5' tall)","Special Attacks":"Nil","Special Defenses":"See below","THAC0":"11","Treasure":"Nil","XP Value":"1,000"},"Koala":{"Activity Cycle":"Any","Alignment":"Neutral or good, usually lawful","Armor Class":"0","Climate/Terrain":"Dreamlands","Damage/Attack":"1d2","Diet":"Nil","Frequency":"Very rare","Hit Dice":"10","Intelligence":"Supra-Genius (19-20)","Magic Resistance":"95%","Morale":"Special","Movement":"6","No. Appearing":"1","No. of Attacks":"1","Organization":"Solitary","Size":"S (2&#189;' tall)","Special Attacks":"Nil","Special Defenses":"See below","THAC0":"11","Treasure":"Nil","XP Value":"1,000"},"Kookaburra":{"Activity Cycle":"Nocturnal","Alignment":"Neutral or good, usually lawful","Armor Class":"0","Climate/Terrain":"Dreamlands","Damage/Attack":"1","Diet":"Nil","Frequency":"Very rare","Hit Dice":"10","Intelligence":"Supra-Genius (19-20)","Magic Resistance":"95%","Morale":"Special","Movement":"6, Fly 18 (A)","No. Appearing":"1","No. of Attacks":"1","Organization":"Solitary","Size":"T (18&rdquo; tall)","Special Attacks":"Nil","Special Defenses":"See below","THAC0":"11","Treasure":"Nil","XP Value":"1,000"}},"title":"Spirit, Walleran"},"sources":["2524"],"statblock_names":[],"title":"Spirit, Walleran","prev_key":"spirtote","next_key":"spirwarr","monster_path":"/appendix/spirwall"}},"staticQueryHashes":[],"slicesMap":{}}
