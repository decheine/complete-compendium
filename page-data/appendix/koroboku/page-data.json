While the powers listed above are the most common, some aarakocra have different or additional powers.</p><p class=\"f\">A race of intelligent, birdlike creatures living in the deepest deserts of Athas, the rare Athasian <a href=\"/appendix/aarakocr\">aarakocra</a> spends its time soaring on thermals in search of food.</p><p>The aarakocra is 7 to 8 feet tall with a wingspan of 20 feet or more. Because of its large wingspan, an aarakocra can carry as much as 75% of its own body weight and still fly easily. An aarakocra can fly a short distance carrying a burden equaling 125% of its own body weight. The average body weight of a full grown male is 100 pounds and a female is 85 pounds.</p><p>Each wing has a &ldquo;hand&rdquo; at its midpoint, consisting of three fingers and an opposable thumb. The fourth finger forms the rigid leading edge of the wing. In flight the hands cannot be used, but on the ground the aarakocra can use its hands almost as a human would. The aarakocra's body is protected by a thin bony plate on the chest, much like a solid rib cage. Talons on its legs can be used as claws and can be retracted to reveal a second set of hands, also with three fingers and an opposable thumb. Except for the chest plate, the entire skeleton is hollow and extremely fragile.</p><p>From a distance, the Athasian aarakocra resembles a huge <a href=\"/appendix/bird\">vulture</a>. Its black eyes, set in the front of the head, provide excellent vision over a long range. The plumage is generally black with a white collar for adult males and black or brown with a smaller white collar for females. Adolescents are a mixture of brown and black. The beak is large and covers most of the head. Plumage begins at the crown of the head and is darker near the head, except for the collar. Athasian aarakocra speak their own language and the languages of vultures and other large birds. Some speak the common tongue (5% to 10% chance depending on how deep in the wastelands a tribe lives).</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Combat:</b> Aarakocra can fight in the air or on the ground. They prefer aerial combat since their bones are too fragile to withstand a solid blow from a human-sized opponent. In combat against creatures on the ground, they prefer to fly over their victim and drop weighted nets. Some aarakocra use darts to harass ground-based opponents.</p><p>If their opponents can fly, the aarakocra generally forgo the use of the net, although large groups sometimes use nets on flying creatures. Normally, aarakocra attack flying creatures with long spears, diving from above and allowing the momentum to carry the spear through the target. Such an attack doubles the damage if the aarakocra have been able to dive at least 50 feet. Only the very largest aarakocra can carry more than one of these spears, they can attack with both at once with no penalty, causing double damage on each strike. All diving attacks are made at +4 and should be treated as a charge attack. All other penalties and restrictions of charge attacks apply.</p><p>The effect of the aarakocra's nets depends on if the opponent is flying at the time it becomes entangled. Creatures on the ground that are hit by a net are entangled and unable to participate in any combat until they make a successful Strength check to get free of the net. Flying creatures hit by a net can no longer fly and immediately begin falling. If they cannot escape the net or use some magical means to arrest the fall, normal falling damage applies.</p><p>Unless victims are entangled in nets, aarakocra are cautious in ground combat. If the aarakocra outnumber their opponents they advance in a straight line and thrust with their spears. If outnumbered, or the opponents are particularly tough, the aarakocra withdraw. Victims entangled in nets are killed or incapacitated for use as food or ransom.</p><p>Athasian aarakocra are mindful of their physical limitations as well as their comparatively low psionic abilities. They do not normally initiate psionic combat. At the first sign of psionic powers from any of their victims, however, all aarakocra that have some ability will use whatever attack and defense modes they can in an attempt to destroy the threat. Large groups of is or more aarakocra may initiate psionic combat if their leaders feel they can win quickly and avoid physical combat.</p><p>In desperation, an aarakocra can attempt to bite an opponent in combat. Because of the unwieldiness of its beak, the aarakocra has a THAC0 of 18 if attacking with this appendage. Further, the birdman causes only 1d2 points of damage with the beak.</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Habitat/Society:</b> Athasian aarakocra live in tribes with 6-20 (2d8+4) members, depending on the prestige of the leader. The largest tribe ever recorded had 50 members. The tribal hunting territory depends on the size of the tribe, usually about 500 square miles for a tribe of 10 members. There are no rigid boundaries between tribes and border disputes are not uncommon.</p><p>Alignments of tribe members are similar to the alignment of the leader. A tribe that has a leader who is neutral good may have neutral good, chaotic good, lawful good, and true neutral members. A predominantly evil tribe does not recognize boundaries with other tribes and treats other tribes as inferior beings to be eliminated.</p><p>Athasian aarakocra aren't happy in enclosed spaces, but they they take refuge in a cave or building if necessary.</p><p>Nonevil tribes live in rocky aeries in the highest peaks they can find. Evil tribes are normally nomadic and use an aerie made by another tribe if they need to remain in an area for a long time, even if they have to evict the tribe that made the nest.</p><p>Aarakocra aren't friendly toward intruders in their territory, especially caravans. They try to extract a toll from the caravan for passage through the desert. Good-aligned tribes allow unhindered passage of caravans that pay a tribute. If someone refuses to pay the tribute, the aarakocra try to capture scouts or outriders from the party and hold them until an even larger tribute is paid. The payment may be either livestock or shiny objects. Aarakocra are smart enough not to be taken in by glass baubles instead of gems, although they cannot tell the difference between the more common gems and the rare ones.</p><p>Evil tribes ask for tribute and often attack a caravan whether it pays or not. Aarakocra always demand shiny objects such as stones. These tribes find humans and demihumans to be quite tasty and prefer them to other food.</p><p>Good-aligned tribes of aarakocra sometimes return a lost traveler to the edge of the desert after first removing any valuables the traveler may be carrying. On very rare occasions a tribe might return a lost group of travelers to the more frequently traveled parts of the desert, again after first taking any valuables as payment.</p><p>The oldest male is the leader of the tribal hunting party and has 4+4 Hit Dice. The oldest female is in charge of the tribal aerie and has 3+3 HD. In tribes that have more than 15 members, the next oldest aarakocra serves as shaman and has 3+3 HD; the shaman completes the triumvirate necessary for proper worship and the summoning of elementals. (Interestingly, no magic-using aarakocra has ever been recorded.) Tribes without a shaman cannot summon <a href=\"/appendix/element1\">air elementals</a>, which is an important part of aarakocra culture.</p><p>The shaman is the leader of the daily sun worship. Aarakocra worship the sun because it provides them with the thermals they need to soar in search of food. The shaman also leads the mystic rituals used to summon an air elemental. Summoning an air elemental is usually done only in preparation for the tribe's most sacred ceremony, the hunt. Small tribes must band together for this ceremony to allow the triumvirate to be formed.</p><p>The ceremony to summon an air elemental must be conducted at dawn and requires the oldest male and female to emit a highpitched keening whistle. The shaman conducts an intricate dance around them, simultaneously chanting an ancient summoning mantra.</p><p>The hunt is the final part of the initiation of adolescent aarakocra to adulthood and often takes the tribe far from their normal teritory. The target is always a <a href=\"/appendix/drakalsi\">silt drake</a>. The hunt is the only time the females leave the relative safety of the nest. Even an evil tribe will not interfere with a tribe on a hunt. An air elemental is often summoned to help find the drake, but never takes part in the actual combat. Although the adult members of the tribe take part in the initial phases of the combat, it is the initiates who deliver the final, killing blows to me drake. Scars from the hunt are considered a mark of pride among all aarakocra.</p><p>The females spend about eight months of the year incubating their eggs. Athasian aarakocra mate for life and a pair normally produces as many as 10 offspring. A female lays one egg a year. Constant incubation is not required because of the high daytime temperatures, so the females can maintain the nest and keep the tribe's treasure in order.</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Ecology:</b> Athasian aarakocra are high on the food chain and have no natural enemies other than <a href=\"/appendix/drakatha\">drakes</a>. Unless evil, aarakocra leave their own territory only to hunt the silt drake and return as soon as possible when the hunt is over. (Evil aarakocra attack others, as noted above.) Aarakocra eggs and hatchlings are sought after by wealthy land owners who wish to use the creatures as scouts and sentries. An egg can bring as much as 10 cp in Tyr's marketplace. Tribes that have had eggs or hatchlings stolen have long memories and sometimes take revenge against the thief at a later date. Captive aarakocra join any tribe they come in contact with.</p><p>Athasian aarakocra have a natural life span of 21-30 years.</p><br clear=\"all\" style=\"clear:both; height:0;\">\r\n","images":["<img src=\"grf/ds.gif\" width=\"150\" height=\"75\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Dark Sun\" title=\"Dark Sun\" align=\"right\">","<img src=\"img/aarakath.gif\" alt=\"Aarakocra (Athas)\" title=\"Aarakocra (Athas)\" border=\"0\" width=\"300\" height=\"360\" style=\"text-align:right;\" align=\"right\">","<img src=\"grf/add2_01.gif\" width=\"200\" height=\"56\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Advanced Dungeons & Dragons 2nd Edition\">"],"setting":"Dark Sun","statblock":{"Aarakocra (Athas)":{"Activity Cycle":"Day","Alignment":"Any","Armor Class":"7","Climate/Terrain":"Deep desert","Damage/Attack":"1d3/1d3 or by weapon","Diet":"Carnivore","Frequency":"Rare","Hit Dice":"2+2","Intelligence":"Average (8-10)","Magic Resistance":"Nil","Morale":"Steady (11)","Movement":"6, Fl 36 (C)","No. Appearing":"1d10","No. of Attacks":"2","Organization":"Tribal","Size":"M (20'+ wingspan)","Special Attacks":"Nil","Special Defenses":"Nil","THAC0":"17","Treasure":"Varies","XP Value":"65"}},"title":"Aarakocra (Athas)"},"sources":["2433"],"statblock_names":[],"title":"Aarakocra (Athas)","prev_key":"zygraat","next_key":"aarakocr","monster_path":"/appendix/aarakath"}}},"pageContext":{"monster_key":"koroboku","monster_data":{"TSR":["2116"],"fullBody":"  <table cellspacing=\"0\" cellpadding=\"0\"><tr class=\"bk\"><th> </th><th class=\"cn\">Common Korobokuru</th><th class=\"cn\">Ishikorobokuru</th></tr><tr><th>Climate/Terrain:</th><td>Tropical, subtropical, and temperate mountains, hills, jungles, and forests</td><td>Arctic and subarctic mountains hills, jungles, and forests</td></tr><tr><th>Frequency:</th><td>Uncommon</td><td>Very rare</td></tr><tr><th>Organization:</th><td>Clans</td><td>Clans</td></tr><tr><th>Activity Cycle:</th><td>Any</td><td>Any</td></tr><tr><th>Diet:</th><td>Omnivore</td><td>Omnivore</td></tr><tr><th>Intelligence:</th><td>Semi- to highly (3-15)</td><td>Semi- to highly (3-15)</td></tr><tr><th>Treasure:</th><td>Individual: L,N; Clan: R,X</td><td>Individual: M,N,Q; Clan: A</td></tr><tr><th>Alignment:</th><td>Chaotic good</td><td>Chaotic good</td></tr><tr><th>No. Appearing:</th><td>20-200</td><td>10-100</td></tr><tr><th>Armor Class:</th><td>10</td><td>10</td></tr><tr><th>Movement:</th><td>6</td><td>6</td></tr><tr><th>Hit Dice:</th><td>1</td><td>1+2</td></tr><tr><th>THAC0:</th><td>20</td><td>20</td></tr><tr><th>No. of Attacks:</th><td>1</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><th>Damage/Attack:</th><td>By weapon</td><td>By weapon</td></tr><tr><th>Special Attacks:</th><td>See below</td><td>See below</td></tr><tr><th>Special Defenses:</th><td>See below</td><td>See below</td></tr><tr><th>Magic Resistance:</th><td>See below</td><td>See below</td></tr><tr><th>Size:</th><td>S (4' tall)</td><td>S (3' tall)</td></tr><tr><th>Morale:</th><td>Elite (13)</td><td>Elite (13)</td></tr><tr><th>XP Value:</th><td>175</td><td>270</td></tr></table><p class=\"f\">The korobokuru are a race of Oriental <a href=\"/appendix/dwarf\">dwarves</a> who live in remote areas. They seldom come in contact with other races.</p><p>Korobokuru stand about 4 feet tall. Their arms and legs are slightly longer in proportion to their bodies than those of a human. They are leaner than western dwarves, with an average weight of about 120 to 140 pounds. Most are bowlegged. They have big, bright eyes - either blue, green, or brown. Their ears are small and somewhat pointed. Their noses are round with flaring nostrils, and their lips are wide and full. Thick hair, usually light brown or blonde, covers their arms and legs, and grows in wild tangles from their heads. Most adult males have sparse beards, and even a few women have short whiskers sprouting beneath their chins. The majority of korobokuru are chaotic or neutral, although they have no alignment restrictions.</p><p>Korobokuru look wild and unkempt. They favor simple clothing, such as cotton trousers and blouses, or a kimono tied at the waist with a rope sash. Clothing is often loose or oversized, wrinkled but clean. Bright colors are shunned in favor of muted greens and browns. As a rule, korobokuru avoid gaudy jewelry and other flashy accessories, but they wear colorful stones on leather straps around their necks, and sometimes decorate their hair with flowers.</p><p>Korobokuru can be barbarians, bushi, samurai, and wu jen. The most common class is barbarian, and samurai are rare. No korobokuru clans hold a position high enough to be samurai. As a result, korobokuru clans must be sponsored by a human clan.</p><p>Korobokuru are an extremely hardy race, and as such, they gain a +1 bonus to their initial Strength and Constitution scores. However, they are not exceptionally bright, and their initial Intelligence scores are modified by -2.</p><p>All korobokuru speak the language of their tribe. They also can speak the trade language, plus the tongues of the <a href=\"/appendix/spirfolk\">spirit folk</a> and <a href=\"/appendix/hengeyok\">hengeyokai</a>. They do not speak an alignment language and cannot learn additional tongues.</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Combat:</b> These dwarves live in harmony with creatures who share their environment, provided those creatures do not compete with them directly. Korobokuru prefer not to associate with other races, however, and they're fiercely territorial. They challenge all unwanted trespassers, attacking if necessary to drive them away.</p><p>By nature, korobokuru are more resistant to magical attacks than most other eastern races. They gain a saving throw bonus of +1 per 4&#189; points of Constitution. (For example, a korobokuru with a Constitution of 10 gains a +2 bonus, while a korobokuru with a Constitution of 7 has a + 1 bonus.) The +1 bonus applies to saves vs. magical rods, staves, wands, or spells.</p><p>Korobokuru also resist harm from toxic substances. Because of their exceptionally strong Constitution, all korobokuru make saves vs. poison with the same bonus that applies to magical attacks (+1 for every 4&#189; points of Constitution).</p><p>Korobokuru boast many of the special survival skills of western dwarves, exceeding them in some cases. For instance, the korobokuru have exceptionally keen infravision with a range of 120'. When studying an underground passage, they can accurately determine its grade and slope 80% of the time. They can determine their approximate depth underground 70% of the time. When studying an underground area within 10 feet of their current position, they can detect new tunnel construction 80% of the time, sliding or shifting walls or rooms 70% of the time, and stonework traps, pits, and deadfalls 60% of the time. Additionally, korobokuru have a 66% chance of recognizing and identifying any normal (nonmagical and unintelligent) plant or animal.</p><p>Korobokuru enjoy an advantage when battling certain foe. They hate <a href=\"/appendix/bakemono\">bakemono</a>, <a href=\"/appendix/goblin\">goblins</a>, <a href=\"/appendix/goblirat\">goblin rats</a>, and <a href=\"/appendix/hobgobli\">hobgoblins</a>. This hatred is so intense that korobokuru receive a +1 attack bonus when fighting these creatures. In addition, large opponents (giants, <a href=\"/appendix/oni\">oni</a>, <a href=\"/appendix/ogre\">ogres</a>, <a href=\"/appendix/ogre\">ogre magi</a>, <a href=\"/appendix/titan\">titans</a>, etc.) suffer a -4 penalty when attempting to hit a korobokuru. (This results from the korokoburu's small size, plus their skill at battling larger creatures.)</p><p>A typical korobokuru force is half male, half female. Males and females are equally adept at fighting. When prepared for battle, korobokuru usually carry shields and wear leather scale armor, which gives them an AC of 6. Generally, a force is armed as follows: short sword (25%), spear (20%), naginata (20%), bow with leaf head arrows (15%), bow with frog crotch arrows (10%), and blowgun (10%). Because of their size, korobokuru cannot use the no-dachi (two-handed swords), pole arms other than naginata, or any bow but the horsebow.</p><p>A korobokuru force consists of 20-200 members, with the following chain of command. A 2nd- to 5th-level barbarian leads each unit of 20 korobokuru. (To determine the level randomly, roll 1d4+1.) If a force includes 60 or more members, a 6th-level barbarian acts as overall commander. (He's the superior of the three barbarian leaders, who each command a group of 20.) If a force has 80 or more members, a supreme commander of 7th or 8th level (50% chance of either) heads up the entire group, including the leaders and commander below him. This supreme commander may be a barbarian (60% chance), bushi (30% chance), or samurai (10% chance). Finally, a force of 80 or more also includes one wu jen of 2nd to 5th level (roll 1d4+1 to randomly determine the level).</p><p>Korobokuru avoid the affairs of men. However, humans occasionally may recruit them as allies if the korobokuru can be convinced that a cause is righteous.</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Habitat/Society:</b> Members of this race dwell in remote sites of great natural beauty, such as lush mountain valleys or sprawling tropical forests. They live in simple villages or camps, and move only when the advance of human settlements requires it. Their buildings are quite crude, with thatched roofs and walls of mud, sticks, and rocks.</p><p>These Oriental dwarves organize into families and clans much as humans do. A korobokuru settlement is a huge, extended family, comprising 20-200 (1d100&times;20) adult males, an equal number of adult females, and a number of children equal to 25% of the adults. Korobokuru mate for life and share a profound bond with their spouses; it is not unusual for a mate to refuse all nourishment if his or her spouse is killed, eventually succumbing to starvation. A female rarely gives birth to more than one or two children during her life. The parents are extremely protective of their young, fighting to the death if necessary to defend them. Korobokuru live for about 400 years.</p><p>Culturally, korobokuru are much less advanced than their human neighbors. Some create simple pieces of art, such as modest makimono and kakemono (picture scrolls), and nishiki-e (colored woodcuts). Most of their time is devoted to practical tasks, however, such as hunting and tending small farms near their secluded settlements.</p><p>Each family tends to specialize in a certain craft or skill, which the parents teach their children. Common specialties include farming, hunting, fishing, weaving, weaponry, military arts, and painting. At least 50 years of study is required before a korobokuru considers himself a master of his craft. On occasion, an especially skilled korobokuru will accept nonfamily members as apprentices. This practice is encouraged if a settlement needs more members of the master's occupation.</p><p>Korobokuru enjoy collecting treasure, especially coins and gems. However, they consider it in poor taste to display their wealth. While traveling, they carry only a few coins. While at home, they rarely keep treasure items on their person. Families bury their treasures in deep holes inside their huts.</p><p>Most other races find korobokuru primitive and inferior. Human societies rarely embrace them as equals. Korobokuru typically are seen as rude, pugnacious, boastful, and somewhat comical by the rest of the world. The dwarfish folk resent this reputation, but do little to disprove it.</p><p>Korobokuru tend to avoid or shun outsiders, but occasionally they invite a friendly visitor to participate in a special incense ceremony conducted by community elders. This ancient ritual signifies trust and mutual respect. The ritual lasts 24 hours, though characters with the etiquette or tea ceremony proficiency can reduce this time by 25%. The ritual involves the meticulous preparation and burning of an incense, which is made from powdered herbs, roots, and minerals. The korobokuru carefully explain each step of the ceremony to invited participants. If a participant attempts to leave early, the elders become insulted and permanently banish him from the settlement. If a participant completes the ceremony, he is accepted as an equal and is welcome to share the settlement's hospitality for as long as it pleases him.</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Ecology:</b> Korobokuru produce few items that interest most outsiders, but their makimono, kakemono, and nishiki-e can fetch high prices from collectors of primitive art. In human communities, armor and weapons manufactured by korobokuru are bought for prices up to 10% higher than locally forged items.</p><p>Korobokuru tend small farms of vegetables and grains, and supplement their diets with fish and small game. Larger korobokuru settlements raise herds of cattle, sheep, and swine.</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Ishikorobokuru</b></p>  <p class=\"ni\">Ishikorobokuru are a rare strain of korobokuru adapted for survival in the coldest regions of Kara-Tur. The ishikorobokuru are shorter and stockier than the common korobokuru. Their skins are bluish, and their hair is silver. They speak their own language as well as the languages of common korobokuru, spirit-folk, hengeyokai, and any human or humanoid races living in the same area. The ishikorobokuru share the same ability restrictions as the common korobokuru. Except for an occasional wu jen, ishikorobokuru are exclusively barbarians.</p><p>Ishikorobokuru share the outlook, habits, and abilities of the common korobokuru. In addition to attack bonuses received by korobokuru, the ishikorobokuru also gain a +1 attack bonus against <a href=\"/appendix/kala\">kala</a>, with whom they sometimes compete for territory. Ishikorobokuru are immune to all cold-based attacks, but they receive double damage from fire-based attacks. A typical ishikorobokuru force is armed with hand axes (30%), spears (25%), clubs (25%), and bows with leaf head arrows (20%). Females fight with the same skill as males.</p><p>An ishikorobokuru tribe comprises 10-60 (1d6&times;10) adult males, an equal number of females, and a number of children equal to 25% of the number of adults. For every 20 males, there is a 2nd- to 5th-level barbarian who serves as leader (roll 1d4+2 to randomly determine the level). In tribes of more than 20 males, a single 6th- or 7th-level barbarian (50% chance of either) serves as the supreme leader. Additionally, these larger tribes include one 2nd- to 5th-level wu jen. The tribes are nomadic, and make temporary settlements in easily defended caves, moving on when they exhaust the game in the area.</p><p></p><br clear=\"all\" style=\"clear:both; height:0;\">\r\n","images":["<img src=\"grf/kt.gif\" width=\"150\" height=\"75\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Kara-Tur (Forgotten Realms)\" title=\"Kara-Tur (Forgotten Realms)\" align=\"right\">","<img src=\"img/koroboku.gif\" alt=\"Korobokuru\" title=\"Korobokuru\" border=\"0\" width=\"300\" height=\"360\" style=\"text-align:right;\" align=\"right\">","<img src=\"grf/add2_01.gif\" width=\"200\" height=\"56\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Advanced Dungeons & Dragons 2nd Edition\">"],"setting":"Kara-Tur (Forgotten Realms)","statblock":{"Common Korobokuru":{"Activity Cycle":"Any","Alignment":"Chaotic good","Armor Class":"10","Climate/Terrain":"Tropical, subtropical, and temperate mountains, hills, jungles, and forests","Damage/Attack":"By weapon","Diet":"Omnivore","Frequency":"Uncommon","Hit Dice":"1","Intelligence":"Semi- to highly (3-15)","Magic Resistance":"See below","Morale":"Elite (13)","Movement":"6","No. Appearing":"20-200","No. of Attacks":"1","Organization":"Clans","Size":"S (4' tall)","Special Attacks":"See below","Special Defenses":"See below","THAC0":"20","Treasure":"Individual: L,N; Clan: R,X","XP Value":"175"},"Ishikorobokuru":{"Activity Cycle":"Any","Alignment":"Chaotic good","Armor Class":"10","Climate/Terrain":"Arctic and subarctic mountains hills, jungles, and forests","Damage/Attack":"By weapon","Diet":"Omnivore","Frequency":"Very rare","Hit Dice":"1+2","Intelligence":"Semi- to highly (3-15)","Magic Resistance":"See below","Morale":"Elite (13)","Movement":"6","No. Appearing":"10-100","No. of Attacks":"1","Organization":"Clans","Size":"S (3' tall)","Special Attacks":"See below","Special Defenses":"See below","THAC0":"20","Treasure":"Individual: M,N,Q; Clan: A","XP Value":"270"}},"title":"Korobokuru"},"sources":["2116"],"statblock_names":[],"title":"Korobokuru","prev_key":"kopru","next_key":"korred","monster_path":"/appendix/koroboku"}},"staticQueryHashes":[],"slicesMap":{}}
