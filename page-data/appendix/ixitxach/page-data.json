They have an evil disposition and worship evil powers; they love to hunt marine humanoids, and then sacrifice or devour their catch.</p><p>Ixitxachitl is both singular and plural; it is properly pronounced ish-it-SHACH-itl, though many refer to them as icks-it-ZACH-it-ul or even icks-it-zuh-chit-ul.</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Combat:</b> A favored tactic of ixitxachitl is to hide in the sand of the ocean floor, wait for prey to pass by, then spring up and bite them. The creatures are not very stealthy, and this tactic gives them normal chances to surprise their prey.</p><p>Some ixitxachitl act as priests, learning special versions of spells which have only verbal components, from the following spheres: Charm, Divination, Elemental (Water), Necromantic, Healing, Protection, and Sun (Darkness only). For every 10 ixitxachitl encountered, there is one ixitxachitl with the abilities of a 2nd-level priest. For every 20, there is an individual with the powers of a 3rd-level priest. For every 50, there is one with 2+2 Hit Dice and the abilities of a 5th-level priest.</p><p>When more than 50 are encountered, they are led by a high priest with 4+4 HD and 8th-level ability. The high priest is accompanied by two guardian priests, each with 3+3 HD and 6th-level ability. Guardian and high priests often have treasure type U, with magical items that can be used without hands. For every 20 ixitxachitl encountered, there is a 50% chance they will be accompanied by a <a href=\"/appendix/vampire\">vampiric</a> ixitxachitl. One in one hundred of these are greater vampiric ixitxachitl, but these are rarely encountered outside a city.</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Habitat/Society:</b> Though they are occasionally encountered in rivers, ixitxachitl live in shallow ocean depths. They usually have a community of 10-100 individuals, which lives in a maze of corridors inside a coral reef. A community usually has 20-200 humanoid slaves to do heavy labor for them, such as carving corridors. The community's entrance is hidden.</p><p>Large communities that have strong leaders, like a greater vampiric ixitxachitl, are sometimes built on the ocean floor. These large cities hold pyramids and other buildings which serve as lairs for small groups of the creatures. Rumors tell of ixitxachitl cities with populations in the thousands. The strongest ixitxachitl in the community leads its religious hierarchy, which controls the lives of the populace.</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Ecology:</b> Ixitxachitl have no natural predators, though they have many enemies, ranging from <a href=\"/appendix/sahuagin\">sahuagin</a> to humans. They are vicious predators who prey on almost any living creature; they often over hunt a region, eliminating all life forms, forcing the ixitxachitl to find new hunting grounds.</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Vampiric Ixitxachitl</b></p>  <p class=\"ni\">These rare creatures are even more dangerous than the others. Each has 2+2 HD and regenerates 3 hp per round. In addition to its normal damage, the bite of a vampiric ixitxachitl drains one life energy level.</p><p>They look no different than other ixitxachitl, and often serve as guards for their leaders.</p><p></p><p class=\"f\"><b>Greater Vampiric Ixitxachitl</b></p>  <p class=\"ni\">These creatures are rare indeed; they achieve greater status only by being bitten by an existing greater vampiric ixitxachitl. These creatures have 8+8 Hit Dice. They drain two life energy levels with a bite (except when the bite is performed on another vampiric member of their race). A greater vampiric ixitxachitl is the center of the large cities of its kind; it is their tyrannical ruler, and they worship it as the incarnation of a greater power. Captives are brought to it to be drained of life.</p><p></p><br clear=\"all\" style=\"clear:both; height:0;\">\r\n","images":["<img src=\"grf/xx.gif\" width=\"150\" height=\"75\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Advanced Dungeons & Dragons 2nd Edition\" title=\"Advanced Dungeons & Dragons 2nd Edition\" align=\"right\">","<img src=\"img/ixitxach.gif\" alt=\"Ixitxachitl\" title=\"Ixitxachitl\" border=\"0\" width=\"300\" height=\"360\" style=\"text-align:right;\" align=\"right\">","<img src=\"grf/tsr_sm.png\" width=\"56\" height=\"59\" border=\"0\" alt=\"TSR\">"],"setting":"Advanced Dungeons & Dragons 2nd Edition","statblock":{"Ixitxachitl":{"Activity Cycle":"Day","Alignment":"Chaotic evil","Armor Class":"6","Climate/Terrain":"Shallow tropical waters","Damage/Attack":"3-12","Diet":"Carnivore","Frequency":"Very rare","Hit Dice":"1+1 to 4+4","Intelligence":"Average to High (8-14)","Magic Resistance":"Nil","Morale":"Elite (13)","Movement":"Sw 12","No. Appearing":"5-12 (1d8+4)","No. of Attacks":"1","Organization":"Tribe","Size":"S-L (3-8' wingspan)","Special Attacks":"Spells, see below","Special Defenses":"Spells, see below","THAC0":"1+1 and 2+2 HD: 19<br>3+3 HD: 17<br>4+4 HD: 15","Treasure":"P,R,S (in lair only)","XP Value":"35<br>1+1 HD priest: 65<br>2+2 HD priest: 120<br>3+3 HD guardian priest: 270<br>4+4 HD high priest: 420<br>2+2 HD vampiric: 420<br>8+8 HD greater vampiric: 4,000"}},"title":"Ixitxachitl"},"sources":["2140"],"statblock_names":[],"title":"Ixitxachitl","prev_key":"ixitixza","next_key":"jabberwo"}},"staticQueryHashes":[],"slicesMap":{}}
