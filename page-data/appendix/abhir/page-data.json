When uncoiled, she can stand taller than a large man. Each of the abhir's six arms can wield a weapon (favored weapons are magical swords and battle axes). This monster can constrict her victim with her snakey tail, and can cause magical darkness in a 5' radius. She has infravision and other extraordinary abilities, any one of which can be used once per round: <i>charm person</i>, <i>teleport</i>, <i>levitate</i> (as an 11th-level wizard), <i>read languages</i>, <i>detect invisibility</i>, <i>pyrotechnics</i>, <i>polymorph self</i>, <i>project image</i>. The abhir can <i>gate</i> in another abhir with a 50% chance of success.</p><p>Abhirs desire the sacrifice of strong warriors, and they are constantly looking for ways to do evil deeds in service of their lords. Lower-level denizens of the outer planes greatly fear the domineering and cruel abhirs.</p><br clear=\"all\" style=\"clear:both; height:0;\">\r\n","images":["<img src=\"grf/ps.gif\" width=\"150\" height=\"75\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Planescape\" title=\"Planescape\" align=\"right\">","<img src=\"grf/add2_01.gif\" width=\"200\" height=\"56\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Advanced Dungeons & Dragons 2nd Edition\">"],"setting":"Planescape","statblock":{"Abhir":{"Activity Cycle":"Any","Alignment":"Chaotic evil","Armor Class":"-7/-5","Climate/Terrain":"Any/Land","Damage/Attack":"2-8 (constriction) and by weapon type (&times;6)","Diet":"Carnivore","Frequency":"Rare","Hit Dice":"7+7","Intelligence":"High (13-14)","Magic Resistance":"50%","Morale":"Champion (15)","Movement":"12","No. Appearing":"13 or 14","No. of Attacks":"7","Organization":"Small group or solitary","Size":"L (7' tall, 30' long)","Special Attacks":"See below","Special Defenses":"+1 or better weapon to hit","THAC0":"13","Treasure":"G","XP Value":"10.000 (includes use of magical weapons)"}},"title":"Abhir"},"sources":["Dungeon#23"],"statblock_names":[],"title":"Abhir","prev_key":"aballin","next_key":"aboleth","monster_path":"/appendix/abhir"}},"staticQueryHashes":[],"slicesMap":{}}
