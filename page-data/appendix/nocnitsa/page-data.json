While the powers listed above are the most common, some aarakocra have different or additional powers.</p><p class=\"f\">A race of intelligent, birdlike creatures living in the deepest deserts of Athas, the rare Athasian <a href=\"/appendix/aarakocr\">aarakocra</a> spends its time soaring on thermals in search of food.</p><p>The aarakocra is 7 to 8 feet tall with a wingspan of 20 feet or more. Because of its large wingspan, an aarakocra can carry as much as 75% of its own body weight and still fly easily. An aarakocra can fly a short distance carrying a burden equaling 125% of its own body weight. The average body weight of a full grown male is 100 pounds and a female is 85 pounds.</p><p>Each wing has a &ldquo;hand&rdquo; at its midpoint, consisting of three fingers and an opposable thumb. The fourth finger forms the rigid leading edge of the wing. In flight the hands cannot be used, but on the ground the aarakocra can use its hands almost as a human would. The aarakocra's body is protected by a thin bony plate on the chest, much like a solid rib cage. Talons on its legs can be used as claws and can be retracted to reveal a second set of hands, also with three fingers and an opposable thumb. Except for the chest plate, the entire skeleton is hollow and extremely fragile.</p><p>From a distance, the Athasian aarakocra resembles a huge <a href=\"/appendix/bird\">vulture</a>. Its black eyes, set in the front of the head, provide excellent vision over a long range. The plumage is generally black with a white collar for adult males and black or brown with a smaller white collar for females. Adolescents are a mixture of brown and black. The beak is large and covers most of the head. Plumage begins at the crown of the head and is darker near the head, except for the collar. Athasian aarakocra speak their own language and the languages of vultures and other large birds. Some speak the common tongue (5% to 10% chance depending on how deep in the wastelands a tribe lives).</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Combat:</b> Aarakocra can fight in the air or on the ground. They prefer aerial combat since their bones are too fragile to withstand a solid blow from a human-sized opponent. In combat against creatures on the ground, they prefer to fly over their victim and drop weighted nets. Some aarakocra use darts to harass ground-based opponents.</p><p>If their opponents can fly, the aarakocra generally forgo the use of the net, although large groups sometimes use nets on flying creatures. Normally, aarakocra attack flying creatures with long spears, diving from above and allowing the momentum to carry the spear through the target. Such an attack doubles the damage if the aarakocra have been able to dive at least 50 feet. Only the very largest aarakocra can carry more than one of these spears, they can attack with both at once with no penalty, causing double damage on each strike. All diving attacks are made at +4 and should be treated as a charge attack. All other penalties and restrictions of charge attacks apply.</p><p>The effect of the aarakocra's nets depends on if the opponent is flying at the time it becomes entangled. Creatures on the ground that are hit by a net are entangled and unable to participate in any combat until they make a successful Strength check to get free of the net. Flying creatures hit by a net can no longer fly and immediately begin falling. If they cannot escape the net or use some magical means to arrest the fall, normal falling damage applies.</p><p>Unless victims are entangled in nets, aarakocra are cautious in ground combat. If the aarakocra outnumber their opponents they advance in a straight line and thrust with their spears. If outnumbered, or the opponents are particularly tough, the aarakocra withdraw. Victims entangled in nets are killed or incapacitated for use as food or ransom.</p><p>Athasian aarakocra are mindful of their physical limitations as well as their comparatively low psionic abilities. They do not normally initiate psionic combat. At the first sign of psionic powers from any of their victims, however, all aarakocra that have some ability will use whatever attack and defense modes they can in an attempt to destroy the threat. Large groups of is or more aarakocra may initiate psionic combat if their leaders feel they can win quickly and avoid physical combat.</p><p>In desperation, an aarakocra can attempt to bite an opponent in combat. Because of the unwieldiness of its beak, the aarakocra has a THAC0 of 18 if attacking with this appendage. Further, the birdman causes only 1d2 points of damage with the beak.</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Habitat/Society:</b> Athasian aarakocra live in tribes with 6-20 (2d8+4) members, depending on the prestige of the leader. The largest tribe ever recorded had 50 members. The tribal hunting territory depends on the size of the tribe, usually about 500 square miles for a tribe of 10 members. There are no rigid boundaries between tribes and border disputes are not uncommon.</p><p>Alignments of tribe members are similar to the alignment of the leader. A tribe that has a leader who is neutral good may have neutral good, chaotic good, lawful good, and true neutral members. A predominantly evil tribe does not recognize boundaries with other tribes and treats other tribes as inferior beings to be eliminated.</p><p>Athasian aarakocra aren't happy in enclosed spaces, but they they take refuge in a cave or building if necessary.</p><p>Nonevil tribes live in rocky aeries in the highest peaks they can find. Evil tribes are normally nomadic and use an aerie made by another tribe if they need to remain in an area for a long time, even if they have to evict the tribe that made the nest.</p><p>Aarakocra aren't friendly toward intruders in their territory, especially caravans. They try to extract a toll from the caravan for passage through the desert. Good-aligned tribes allow unhindered passage of caravans that pay a tribute. If someone refuses to pay the tribute, the aarakocra try to capture scouts or outriders from the party and hold them until an even larger tribute is paid. The payment may be either livestock or shiny objects. Aarakocra are smart enough not to be taken in by glass baubles instead of gems, although they cannot tell the difference between the more common gems and the rare ones.</p><p>Evil tribes ask for tribute and often attack a caravan whether it pays or not. Aarakocra always demand shiny objects such as stones. These tribes find humans and demihumans to be quite tasty and prefer them to other food.</p><p>Good-aligned tribes of aarakocra sometimes return a lost traveler to the edge of the desert after first removing any valuables the traveler may be carrying. On very rare occasions a tribe might return a lost group of travelers to the more frequently traveled parts of the desert, again after first taking any valuables as payment.</p><p>The oldest male is the leader of the tribal hunting party and has 4+4 Hit Dice. The oldest female is in charge of the tribal aerie and has 3+3 HD. In tribes that have more than 15 members, the next oldest aarakocra serves as shaman and has 3+3 HD; the shaman completes the triumvirate necessary for proper worship and the summoning of elementals. (Interestingly, no magic-using aarakocra has ever been recorded.) Tribes without a shaman cannot summon <a href=\"/appendix/element1\">air elementals</a>, which is an important part of aarakocra culture.</p><p>The shaman is the leader of the daily sun worship. Aarakocra worship the sun because it provides them with the thermals they need to soar in search of food. The shaman also leads the mystic rituals used to summon an air elemental. Summoning an air elemental is usually done only in preparation for the tribe's most sacred ceremony, the hunt. Small tribes must band together for this ceremony to allow the triumvirate to be formed.</p><p>The ceremony to summon an air elemental must be conducted at dawn and requires the oldest male and female to emit a highpitched keening whistle. The shaman conducts an intricate dance around them, simultaneously chanting an ancient summoning mantra.</p><p>The hunt is the final part of the initiation of adolescent aarakocra to adulthood and often takes the tribe far from their normal teritory. The target is always a <a href=\"/appendix/drakalsi\">silt drake</a>. The hunt is the only time the females leave the relative safety of the nest. Even an evil tribe will not interfere with a tribe on a hunt. An air elemental is often summoned to help find the drake, but never takes part in the actual combat. Although the adult members of the tribe take part in the initial phases of the combat, it is the initiates who deliver the final, killing blows to me drake. Scars from the hunt are considered a mark of pride among all aarakocra.</p><p>The females spend about eight months of the year incubating their eggs. Athasian aarakocra mate for life and a pair normally produces as many as 10 offspring. A female lays one egg a year. Constant incubation is not required because of the high daytime temperatures, so the females can maintain the nest and keep the tribe's treasure in order.</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Ecology:</b> Athasian aarakocra are high on the food chain and have no natural enemies other than <a href=\"/appendix/drakatha\">drakes</a>. Unless evil, aarakocra leave their own territory only to hunt the silt drake and return as soon as possible when the hunt is over. (Evil aarakocra attack others, as noted above.) Aarakocra eggs and hatchlings are sought after by wealthy land owners who wish to use the creatures as scouts and sentries. An egg can bring as much as 10 cp in Tyr's marketplace. Tribes that have had eggs or hatchlings stolen have long memories and sometimes take revenge against the thief at a later date. Captive aarakocra join any tribe they come in contact with.</p><p>Athasian aarakocra have a natural life span of 21-30 years.</p><br clear=\"all\" style=\"clear:both; height:0;\">\r\n","images":["<img src=\"grf/ds.gif\" width=\"150\" height=\"75\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Dark Sun\" title=\"Dark Sun\" align=\"right\">","<img src=\"img/aarakath.gif\" alt=\"Aarakocra (Athas)\" title=\"Aarakocra (Athas)\" border=\"0\" width=\"300\" height=\"360\" style=\"text-align:right;\" align=\"right\">","<img src=\"grf/add2_01.gif\" width=\"200\" height=\"56\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Advanced Dungeons & Dragons 2nd Edition\">"],"setting":"Dark Sun","statblock":{"Aarakocra (Athas)":{"Activity Cycle":"Day","Alignment":"Any","Armor Class":"7","Climate/Terrain":"Deep desert","Damage/Attack":"1d3/1d3 or by weapon","Diet":"Carnivore","Frequency":"Rare","Hit Dice":"2+2","Intelligence":"Average (8-10)","Magic Resistance":"Nil","Morale":"Steady (11)","Movement":"6, Fl 36 (C)","No. Appearing":"1d10","No. of Attacks":"2","Organization":"Tribal","Size":"M (20'+ wingspan)","Special Attacks":"Nil","Special Defenses":"Nil","THAC0":"17","Treasure":"Varies","XP Value":"65"}},"title":"Aarakocra (Athas)"},"sources":["2433"],"statblock_names":[],"title":"Aarakocra (Athas)","prev_key":"zygraat","next_key":"aarakocr","monster_path":"/appendix/aarakath"}}},"pageContext":{"monster_key":"nocnitsa","monster_data":{"TSR":["TheLonesomeRoad"],"fullBody":"  <table cellspacing=\"0\" cellpadding=\"0\"><tr><th>Climate/Terrain:</th><td>Temperate lands (Barovia)</td></tr><tr><th>Frequency:</th><td>Very rare</td></tr><tr><th>Organization:</th><td>Solitary</td></tr><tr><th>Activity Cycle:</th><td>Night</td></tr><tr><th>Diet:</th><td>Blood</td></tr><tr><th>Intelligence:</th><td>Exceptional (15-16)</td></tr><tr><th>Treasure:</th><td>Nil</td></tr><tr><th>Alignment:</th><td>Chaotic evil</td></tr><tr><th>No. Appearing:</th><td>1</td></tr><tr><th>Armor Class:</th><td>2</td></tr><tr><th>Movement:</th><td>12, Fl 15 (B)</td></tr><tr><th>Hit Dice:</th><td>6+6</td></tr><tr><th>THAC0:</th><td>13</td></tr><tr><th>No. of Attacks:</th><td>3</td></tr><tr><th>Damage/Attack:</th><td>1d6+4/1d6+4/1d4+4</td></tr><tr><th>Special Attacks:</th><td>Blood drain, sleep</td></tr><tr><th>Special Defenses:</th><td>+1 or better to hit, see below</td></tr><tr><th>Magic Resistance:</th><td>Nil</td></tr><tr><th>Size:</th><td>M (6' tall)</td></tr><tr><th>Morale:</th><td>Elite (14)</td></tr><tr><th>XP Value:</th><td>2,000</td></tr></table><p class=\"f\"><i>Why do I close the chimney flue before going to bed? Well? Yes, vampires must ask permission to enter a home. But that same restriction doesn?t apply to everything that roams the countryside at night.</i></p><p><i>- Andrei Tiszanov</i></p><p><br></p><p class=\"ni\">The nocnitsa, sometimes called a night terror, is one of the most terrifying creatures to plague Barovia. Possessing the most dangerous attributes of a <a href=\"/appendix/nosferat\">nosferatu</a> and <a href=\"/appendix/shadow\">shadow</a>, this nocturnal monster seeks living blood, and its feedings are often mistaken for those of a nosferatu vampire.</p><p>The nocnitsa's natural form is that of an old crone, formed from indistinct, flickering shadows. Though she appears to be severely hunched over with age, the nocnitsa stands a full six feet tall. Its gnarled hands are tipped with wicked talons, while the creature's lower half trails off into wisps of darkness. Few facial features can be discerned, except for the white spots that serve as the creature's eyes, and the mouth filled with crooked fangs.</p><p>Nocnitsas do not communicate with other creatures, but it is not known if this is by choice or because of inability. They do emit a horrible, wheezing yowl when threatened.</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Combat:</b> Nocnitsas are powerful combatants, but unless cornered they prefer to flee rather than fight. They are cunning opponents, quickly singling out powerful warriors or spellcasters for elimination. If a nocnitsa has the advantage of surprise, it will ambush the most powerful member of group, strike quickly, and then flee into the night. Like shadows, nocnitsas are 90% undetectable in all conditions but the brightest light.</p><p>A nocnitsa possesses a Strength of 18/76, which grants her a +2 to attack rolls and a +4 to damage rolls (already factored into the monster's statistics above). The nocnitsa can attack twice in a round with her sharp claws for 1d6+4 damage each, and once with her bite for 1d4+4 damage. Nocnitsas can only be struck by weapons of at least +1 enchantment. They are not undead creatures, but take 2d4 damage from a vial of holy water, and can be turned as spectres by priests normally able to turn undead. They are immune to poison, disease, suffocation, sleep, and life-affecting spells and effects, but are vulnerable to other mind-affecting magic (such as <i>charm</i> and <i>hold</i>). Though they dislike bright light, nocnitsas are not physically affected by it, and do not suffer the worst effects of a <i>sunray</i> spell. A nocnitsa can fly in her natural form with remarkable agility, and can shapechange into a <a href=\"/appendix/raven\">raven</a> at will. The transformation takes one round, however, during which time the nocnitsa can take no other actions, and opponents receive a +4 bonus to hit the creature.</p><p>Raven Form: AC 7; MV 1, Fl 36 (B); #AT 1; Dmg/AT 1; SZ T.</p><p>Like a <a href=\"/appendix/vampire\">vampire</a>, the nocnitsa has a powerful gaze attack. Anyone who looks into the creature's white eyes must save vs. spell of be affected by a powerful version of the <i>sleep</i> spell. This gaze can affect creatures of any hit dice, though it does not affect undead or other creatures normally immune to sleep. The <i>sleep</i> functions normally in all other respects, though it lasts for three turns (thirty minutes) and the victim is not awakened by the nocnitsa's blood drain (though he is still awakened by other attacks).</p><p>A nocnitsa can drain blood from victim who has fallen under her <i>sleep</i> gaze, as well as anyone who is unconscious or otherwise helpless. The nocnitsa bites the victim on the neck, and begins to drain Constitution points at a rate of one per round, much like a nosferatu. Like such undead creatures, the nocnitsa can increase the rate of this blood drain to three points of Constitution per round if it so desires. Constitution points are regained at a rate of one point every two days. Victims who reach zero Constitution are slain, but do not themselves become nocnitsas. Nocnitsas do not normally kill their victims outright, but prefer to visit them many times over the course of weeks, while the hapless soul wastes away from anemia.</p><p>An individual can be protected against a nocnitsa if the proper precautions are taken. <i>Blessing</i> someone before they fall asleep will prevent the nocnitsa from draining the recipient's blood for the duration of the night. Furthermore, a nocnitsa cannot enter a circle made with iron filings, though she can break the circle through indirect means.</p><p>It should be noted that while nocnitsas appear insubstantial, they are not truly ethereal, and cannot pass through solid objects or the like.</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Habitat/Society:</b> Almost nothing is known of the nocnitsa's origins or nature. At night, they slip into Barovian homes through chimneys or other convenient entrances, and seek out the youngest blood in the household (favoring small children and infants). They flee if discovered, but will often return to favorite &ldquo;feeding grounds&rdquo; at a later date even if they have been sighted or threatened. Nocnitsas are also known to attack wilderness travelers foolish enough to be journeying at night.</p><p>Barovians consider the nocnitsas to be a form of undead, but the <a href=\"/appendix/humavist\">Vistani</a> know better. Oddly enough, their word for the creatures translates loosely as &ldquo;visiting grandmothers&rdquo;, and the gypsies are said to be protected against their feedings. The wiser raunies among the Vistani say that the nocnitsas are the embodied essence of Barovians' paralyzing fear of the dark.</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Ecology:</b> Though they are not truly undead, nocnitsas seem to be similarly isolated from the natural world, existing only to feed upon the living. They do not require sleep or any sustenance other than warm blood. Some brave scholars have observed that nocnitsas have no daytime lairs, and seem to simply vanish at sunrise and then reappear at sunset.</p><p><br></p><p class=\"ni\"><a href=\"http://webspace.webring.com/people/du/um_8226/monsters//appendix/nocnitsa\">The Lonesome Road</a></p><br clear=\"all\" style=\"clear:both; height:0;\">\r\n","images":["<img src=\"grf/rv.gif\" width=\"150\" height=\"75\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Ravenloft\" title=\"Ravenloft\" align=\"right\">","<img src=\"grf/add2_01.gif\" width=\"200\" height=\"56\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Advanced Dungeons & Dragons 2nd Edition\">"],"setting":"Ravenloft","statblock":{"Nocnitsa":{"Activity Cycle":"Night","Alignment":"Chaotic evil","Armor Class":"2","Climate/Terrain":"Temperate lands (Barovia)","Damage/Attack":"1d6+4/1d6+4/1d4+4","Diet":"Blood","Frequency":"Very rare","Hit Dice":"6+6","Intelligence":"Exceptional (15-16)","Magic Resistance":"Nil","Morale":"Elite (14)","Movement":"12, Fl 15 (B)","No. Appearing":"1","No. of Attacks":"3","Organization":"Solitary","Size":"M (6' tall)","Special Attacks":"Blood drain, sleep","Special Defenses":"+1 or better to hit, see below","THAC0":"13","Treasure":"Nil","XP Value":"2,000"}},"title":"Nocnitsa"},"sources":["TheLonesomeRoad"],"statblock_names":[],"title":"Nocnitsa","prev_key":"nixie","next_key":"noctral","monster_path":"/appendix/nocnitsa"}},"staticQueryHashes":[],"slicesMap":{}}
