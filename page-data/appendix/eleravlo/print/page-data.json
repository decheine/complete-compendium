While the powers listed above are the most common, some aarakocra have different or additional powers.</p><p class=\"f\">A race of intelligent, birdlike creatures living in the deepest deserts of Athas, the rare Athasian <a href=\"/appendix/aarakocr\">aarakocra</a> spends its time soaring on thermals in search of food.</p><p>The aarakocra is 7 to 8 feet tall with a wingspan of 20 feet or more. Because of its large wingspan, an aarakocra can carry as much as 75% of its own body weight and still fly easily. An aarakocra can fly a short distance carrying a burden equaling 125% of its own body weight. The average body weight of a full grown male is 100 pounds and a female is 85 pounds.</p><p>Each wing has a &ldquo;hand&rdquo; at its midpoint, consisting of three fingers and an opposable thumb. The fourth finger forms the rigid leading edge of the wing. In flight the hands cannot be used, but on the ground the aarakocra can use its hands almost as a human would. The aarakocra's body is protected by a thin bony plate on the chest, much like a solid rib cage. Talons on its legs can be used as claws and can be retracted to reveal a second set of hands, also with three fingers and an opposable thumb. Except for the chest plate, the entire skeleton is hollow and extremely fragile.</p><p>From a distance, the Athasian aarakocra resembles a huge <a href=\"/appendix/bird\">vulture</a>. Its black eyes, set in the front of the head, provide excellent vision over a long range. The plumage is generally black with a white collar for adult males and black or brown with a smaller white collar for females. Adolescents are a mixture of brown and black. The beak is large and covers most of the head. Plumage begins at the crown of the head and is darker near the head, except for the collar. Athasian aarakocra speak their own language and the languages of vultures and other large birds. Some speak the common tongue (5% to 10% chance depending on how deep in the wastelands a tribe lives).</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Combat:</b> Aarakocra can fight in the air or on the ground. They prefer aerial combat since their bones are too fragile to withstand a solid blow from a human-sized opponent. In combat against creatures on the ground, they prefer to fly over their victim and drop weighted nets. Some aarakocra use darts to harass ground-based opponents.</p><p>If their opponents can fly, the aarakocra generally forgo the use of the net, although large groups sometimes use nets on flying creatures. Normally, aarakocra attack flying creatures with long spears, diving from above and allowing the momentum to carry the spear through the target. Such an attack doubles the damage if the aarakocra have been able to dive at least 50 feet. Only the very largest aarakocra can carry more than one of these spears, they can attack with both at once with no penalty, causing double damage on each strike. All diving attacks are made at +4 and should be treated as a charge attack. All other penalties and restrictions of charge attacks apply.</p><p>The effect of the aarakocra's nets depends on if the opponent is flying at the time it becomes entangled. Creatures on the ground that are hit by a net are entangled and unable to participate in any combat until they make a successful Strength check to get free of the net. Flying creatures hit by a net can no longer fly and immediately begin falling. If they cannot escape the net or use some magical means to arrest the fall, normal falling damage applies.</p><p>Unless victims are entangled in nets, aarakocra are cautious in ground combat. If the aarakocra outnumber their opponents they advance in a straight line and thrust with their spears. If outnumbered, or the opponents are particularly tough, the aarakocra withdraw. Victims entangled in nets are killed or incapacitated for use as food or ransom.</p><p>Athasian aarakocra are mindful of their physical limitations as well as their comparatively low psionic abilities. They do not normally initiate psionic combat. At the first sign of psionic powers from any of their victims, however, all aarakocra that have some ability will use whatever attack and defense modes they can in an attempt to destroy the threat. Large groups of is or more aarakocra may initiate psionic combat if their leaders feel they can win quickly and avoid physical combat.</p><p>In desperation, an aarakocra can attempt to bite an opponent in combat. Because of the unwieldiness of its beak, the aarakocra has a THAC0 of 18 if attacking with this appendage. Further, the birdman causes only 1d2 points of damage with the beak.</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Habitat/Society:</b> Athasian aarakocra live in tribes with 6-20 (2d8+4) members, depending on the prestige of the leader. The largest tribe ever recorded had 50 members. The tribal hunting territory depends on the size of the tribe, usually about 500 square miles for a tribe of 10 members. There are no rigid boundaries between tribes and border disputes are not uncommon.</p><p>Alignments of tribe members are similar to the alignment of the leader. A tribe that has a leader who is neutral good may have neutral good, chaotic good, lawful good, and true neutral members. A predominantly evil tribe does not recognize boundaries with other tribes and treats other tribes as inferior beings to be eliminated.</p><p>Athasian aarakocra aren't happy in enclosed spaces, but they they take refuge in a cave or building if necessary.</p><p>Nonevil tribes live in rocky aeries in the highest peaks they can find. Evil tribes are normally nomadic and use an aerie made by another tribe if they need to remain in an area for a long time, even if they have to evict the tribe that made the nest.</p><p>Aarakocra aren't friendly toward intruders in their territory, especially caravans. They try to extract a toll from the caravan for passage through the desert. Good-aligned tribes allow unhindered passage of caravans that pay a tribute. If someone refuses to pay the tribute, the aarakocra try to capture scouts or outriders from the party and hold them until an even larger tribute is paid. The payment may be either livestock or shiny objects. Aarakocra are smart enough not to be taken in by glass baubles instead of gems, although they cannot tell the difference between the more common gems and the rare ones.</p><p>Evil tribes ask for tribute and often attack a caravan whether it pays or not. Aarakocra always demand shiny objects such as stones. These tribes find humans and demihumans to be quite tasty and prefer them to other food.</p><p>Good-aligned tribes of aarakocra sometimes return a lost traveler to the edge of the desert after first removing any valuables the traveler may be carrying. On very rare occasions a tribe might return a lost group of travelers to the more frequently traveled parts of the desert, again after first taking any valuables as payment.</p><p>The oldest male is the leader of the tribal hunting party and has 4+4 Hit Dice. The oldest female is in charge of the tribal aerie and has 3+3 HD. In tribes that have more than 15 members, the next oldest aarakocra serves as shaman and has 3+3 HD; the shaman completes the triumvirate necessary for proper worship and the summoning of elementals. (Interestingly, no magic-using aarakocra has ever been recorded.) Tribes without a shaman cannot summon <a href=\"/appendix/element1\">air elementals</a>, which is an important part of aarakocra culture.</p><p>The shaman is the leader of the daily sun worship. Aarakocra worship the sun because it provides them with the thermals they need to soar in search of food. The shaman also leads the mystic rituals used to summon an air elemental. Summoning an air elemental is usually done only in preparation for the tribe's most sacred ceremony, the hunt. Small tribes must band together for this ceremony to allow the triumvirate to be formed.</p><p>The ceremony to summon an air elemental must be conducted at dawn and requires the oldest male and female to emit a highpitched keening whistle. The shaman conducts an intricate dance around them, simultaneously chanting an ancient summoning mantra.</p><p>The hunt is the final part of the initiation of adolescent aarakocra to adulthood and often takes the tribe far from their normal teritory. The target is always a <a href=\"/appendix/drakalsi\">silt drake</a>. The hunt is the only time the females leave the relative safety of the nest. Even an evil tribe will not interfere with a tribe on a hunt. An air elemental is often summoned to help find the drake, but never takes part in the actual combat. Although the adult members of the tribe take part in the initial phases of the combat, it is the initiates who deliver the final, killing blows to me drake. Scars from the hunt are considered a mark of pride among all aarakocra.</p><p>The females spend about eight months of the year incubating their eggs. Athasian aarakocra mate for life and a pair normally produces as many as 10 offspring. A female lays one egg a year. Constant incubation is not required because of the high daytime temperatures, so the females can maintain the nest and keep the tribe's treasure in order.</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Ecology:</b> Athasian aarakocra are high on the food chain and have no natural enemies other than <a href=\"/appendix/drakatha\">drakes</a>. Unless evil, aarakocra leave their own territory only to hunt the silt drake and return as soon as possible when the hunt is over. (Evil aarakocra attack others, as noted above.) Aarakocra eggs and hatchlings are sought after by wealthy land owners who wish to use the creatures as scouts and sentries. An egg can bring as much as 10 cp in Tyr's marketplace. Tribes that have had eggs or hatchlings stolen have long memories and sometimes take revenge against the thief at a later date. Captive aarakocra join any tribe they come in contact with.</p><p>Athasian aarakocra have a natural life span of 21-30 years.</p><p></p><br clear=\"all\" style=\"clear:both; height:0;\">\r\n","images":["<img src=\"grf/ds.gif\" width=\"150\" height=\"75\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Dark Sun\" title=\"Dark Sun\" align=\"right\">","<img src=\"img/aarakath.gif\" alt=\"Aarakocra (Athas)\" title=\"Aarakocra (Athas)\" border=\"0\" width=\"300\" height=\"360\" style=\"text-align:right;\" align=\"right\">","<img src=\"grf/add2_01.gif\" width=\"200\" height=\"56\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Advanced Dungeons & Dragons 2nd Edition\">"],"setting":"Dark Sun","statblock":{"Aarakocra (Athas)":{"Activity Cycle":"Day","Alignment":"Any","Armor Class":"7","Climate/Terrain":"Deep desert","Damage/Attack":"1d3/1d3 or by weapon","Diet":"Carnivore","Frequency":"Rare","Hit Dice":"2+2","Intelligence":"Average (8-10)","Magic Resistance":"Nil","Morale":"Steady (11)","Movement":"6, Fl 36 (C)","No. Appearing":"1d10","No. of Attacks":"2","Organization":"Tribal","Size":"M (20'+ wingspan)","Special Attacks":"Nil","Special Defenses":"Nil","THAC0":"17","Treasure":"Varies","XP Value":"65"}},"title":"Aarakocra (Athas)"},"sources":["2433"],"statblock_names":[],"title":"Aarakocra (Athas)","prev_key":"zygraat","next_key":"aarakocr","monster_path":"/appendix/aarakath"}}},"pageContext":{"monster_key":"eleravlo","monster_data":{"TSR":["2122"],"fullBody":"  <table cellspacing=\"0\" cellpadding=\"0\"><tr class=\"bk\"><th> </th><th class=\"cn\">Pyre</th><th class=\"cn\">Blood</th><th class=\"cn\">Mist</th><th class=\"cn\">Grave</th></tr><tr><th>Climate/Terrain:</th><td>Any Ravenloft land</td><td>Any Ravenloft</td><td>Any Ravenloft</td><td>Any Ravenloft Graveyard</td></tr><tr><th>Frequency:</th><td>Very rare</td><td>Very Rare</td><td>Very rare</td><td>Very rare</td></tr><tr><th>Organization:</th><td>Solitary</td><td>Solitary</td><td>Solitary</td><td>Solitary</td></tr><tr><th>Activity Cycle:</th><td>Any</td><td>Any</td><td>Any</td><td>Any</td></tr><tr><th>Diet:</th><td>Special</td><td>Special</td><td>Special</td><td>Special</td></tr><tr><th>Intelligence:</th><td>Low (5-7)</td><td>Low (5-7)</td><td>Low (5-7)</td><td>Low (5-7)</td></tr><tr><th>Treasure:</th><td>Nil</td><td>Nil</td><td>Nil</td><td>Nil</td></tr><tr><th>Alignment:</th><td>Neutral</td><td>Neutral</td><td>Neutral</td><td>Neutral</td></tr><tr><th>No. Appearing:</th><td>1</td><td>1</td><td>1</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><th>Armor Class:</th><td>0</td><td>0</td><td>0</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><th>Movement:</th><td>12</td><td>12</td><td>Fl 36 (A)</td><td>6</td></tr><tr><th>Hit Dice:</th><td>8, 12, or 16</td><td>8, 12, or 16</td><td>8, 12, or 16</td><td>8, 12, or 16</td></tr><tr><th>THAC0:</th><td>8 HD: 13<br>12 HD: 9<br>16 HD: 5</td><td>8 HD: 13<br>12 HD: 9<br>16 HD: 5</td><td>8 HD: 13<br>12 HD: 9<br>16 HD: 5</td><td>8 HD: 13<br>12 HD: 9<br>16 HD: 5</td></tr><tr><th>No. of Attacks:</th><td>1</td><td>1</td><td>1</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><th>Damage/Attack:</th><td>3d8</td><td>3d6</td><td>2-20 (2d10)</td><td>4-40 (4d10)</td></tr><tr><th>Special Attacks:</th><td>See below</td><td>See below</td><td><i>Infuse evil</i></td><td>Sink</td></tr><tr><th>Special Defenses:</th><td>See below</td><td>See below</td><td>See below</td><td>See below</td></tr><tr><th>Magic Resistance:</th><td>Nil</td><td>Nil</td><td>Nil</td><td>Nil</td></tr><tr><th>Size:</th><td>8 HD: L (8' tall)<br>12 HD: L (12' tall)<br>16 HD: H (16' tall)</td><td>8 HD: L (8' tall)<br>12 HD: L (12' tall)<br>16 HD: H (16' tall)</td><td>8 HD: L (8' tall)<br>12 HD: L (12' tall)<br>16 HD: H (16' tall)</td><td>8 HD: L (8' tall)<br>12 HD: L (12' tall)<br>16 HD: H (16' tall)</td></tr><tr><th>Morale:</th><td>8 HD: Champion (15-16)<br>12 HD: Champion (15-16)<br>16 HD: Fanatic (17-18)</td><td>8 HD: Champion (15-16)<br>12 HD: Champion (15-16)<br>16 HD: Fanatic (17-18)</td><td>8 HD: Champion (15-16)<br>12 HD: Champion (15-16)<br>16 HD: Fanatic (17-18)</td><td>8 HD: Champion (15-16)<br>12 HD: Champion (15-16)<br>16 HD: Fanatic (17-18)</td></tr><tr><th>XP Value:</th><td>8 HD: 3,000<br>12 HD: 7,000<br>16 HD: 11,000</td><td>8 HD: 3,000<br>12 HD: 7,000<br>16 HD: 11,000</td><td>8 HD: 4,000<br>12 HD: 8,000<br>16 HD: 12,000</td><td>8 HD: 3,000<br>12 HD: 7,000<br>16 HD: 11,000</td></tr></table><h2><img src=\"/img/spc/eleravl1.gif\" width=\"300\" height=\"360\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Pyre and Mist Elemental\" title=\"Pyre and Mist Elemental\" style=\"float:left;\">Pyre Elemental</h2><p class=\"f\">The wild and dancing pyre elemental is drawn from the flames of a funeral pyre or some large burning associated with a burial rite.</p><p>A pyre elemental appears as a slender column of intense flame with tendrils of fire licking away from it like the waving arms of a dancer.</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Combat:</b> A pyre elemental attacks those it encounters with unmatched savagery, taking delight in the destruction and death it causes. Anyone who is struck by one of the lashing streams of fire that it wields whip-like in combat suffers 3d8 points of damage. Their armor (including shields and magical items of protection) must make saving throws vs. magical fire. Suits of armor that fail their saves have their armor class reduced in effectiveness one step. Thus, a suit of brigandine armor that fails its saving throw is reduced from AC 6 to AC 7. Shields and magical devices that improve the wearer's armor class which fail their saves are destroyed.</p><h2>Blood Elemental<img src=\"/img/spc/eleravl2.gif\" width=\"300\" height=\"360\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Blood and Grave Elemental\" title=\"Blood and Grave Elemental\" style=\"float:right\"></h2><p class=\"f\">A blood elemental can be called forth only from a large quantity of blood or from water drawn from the lungs of drowned men. Because of the difficulty in obtaining these materials, they are the rarest of the <a href=\"/appendix/eleravgi\">Ravenloft elementals</a>.</p><p>Blood elementals appear as roughly humanoid creatures composed entirely of blood. They leave a trail of drying blood on the ground behind them and fill the air around them with the smells of salt and iron. A pair of fluid tentacles whip about the creature and allow it to manipulate objects and attack enemies.</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Combat:</b> A blood elemental will attack in one of two ways. The first, and most common means of attack is a blow from one of its tentacles. Each such strike inflicts 3d6 points of damage. Further, the victim of such an attack must make a saving throw versus spells or have a portion of his own blood drawn forth from his body and added to that of the elemental. The amount of blood lost in this way is equal to the damage done by the initial blow. Thus, an attack that inflicts 12 points of damage is followed by a potential blood drain that inflicts an additional 12 points of damage. Hit points lost to the blood drain are added directly to the elemental's own hit point total (to a maximum of 8 hit points per Hit Die). When striking at a target that has no blood of its own (a <a href=\"/appendix/golem\">golem</a>, say), the blood elemental cannot employ its blood drain attack and suffers a -2 penalty per die on all damage rolls (to a minimum of 1 point per die).</p><p>In any round that the elemental chooses not to attack, it may attempt to smother an opponent. To do so, the elemental makes a normal attack roll to hurl itself onto the target of the attack. If it succeeds, the victim of the attack must make a saving throw versus death or find that the elemental has filled his nose, mouth, and lungs with blood. The victim of this attack has a very good chance of drowning (as described in the <i>AD&D Player's Handbook</i>). On the next round, the elemental is free to move away from this victim and attack another character, leaving the first target for dead. Attacks on the elemental while it is smothering do full damage to the elemental and half damage to the victim (who is unable to lash out at the elemental while being smothered).</p><p>Curiously, although they are a variant on <a href=\"/appendix/element2\">water elementals</a>, blood elementals are unable to enter or cross open water. If forced into such a situation, they begin to dissipate - suffering 1d10 points of damage per round-until such time as they break contact with the water.</p><h2>Mist Elemental</h2><p class=\"f\">A mist elemental is a relative of the traditional air elemental who has been formed from the essences of the Ravenloft Mists themselves. Once conjured, the mist elemental appears as a drifting cloud of white vapor that looks like nothing more than a patch of fog. Because of this, a mist elemental that is moving about in a region of fog or mist is treated as if it were invisible.</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Combat:</b> When a mist elemental chooses to attack, it does so with its chilling, evil touch. Moving with a speed one would never expect from a being that seems to drift about at the mercy of the wind, the elemental moves toward (and then through) its target. In so doing, the creature has the ability to employ one of two attack modes. The first is a simple, straight-forward attack that inflicts 2d20 points of damage from the creature's chilling presence.</p><p>In lieu of inflicting damage, however, the mist elemental may seek to <i>infuse evil</i> into the victim. When it does so, the creature seems to enter the body of the victim and then pass on through it without harm. However, anyone subject to such an attack must save vs. spells or have their alignment shifted to chaotic evil. In addition, a character who has been infused is also <i>charmed</i> by the elemental and will not act against it. The elemental may not <i>infuse evil</i> twice in a row. That is, it may not <i>infuse evil</i> again until after it attacks and attempts to inflict damage. This attack may be against the same character or another one. All of the normal penalties associated with an involuntary alignment change are in effect following an attack by a mist elemental. In order to regain their original alignment and break the <i>charm</i> upon them, <i>infused</i> characters must receive a <i>remove curse</i> spell cast by an individual of their true alignment.</p><h2>Grave Elemental</h2><p class=\"f\">The grave elemental is a variant <a href=\"/appendix/element1\">earth elemental</a> that is drawn from the soil of a graveyard or similar resting place of the dead. It appears as a towering, man-shaped mass of earth with bones and the shattered remnants of coffins protruding from it.</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Combat:</b> A grave elemental cannot travel through water, but can move effortlessly through earth and stone. It often uses the latter ability to allow it to lurk beneath the surface of the ground while would-be victims draw near. When they are right above it, it explodes upward and attacks, imposing a -4 penalty on all surprise rolls made by its adversaries.</p><p>When grave elementals engage in combat, their preferred means of attack is simply a blow from their mighty fists. The damage they inflict with such an attack is dependant on their size, with 8 HD elementals delivering 4d8 points of damage, 12 HD elementals delivering 4d10 points of damage, and the massive 16 HD elementals inflicting a crushing 4d12 points of damage.Grave elementals are less effective when striking at targets who are sir- or waterborne. Obviously, they cannot employ their <i>sink</i> power (see below) against such creatures and any physical damage they inflict on them is reduced by 2 points per die (to a minimum of 1 point per die).</p><p>In lieu of attacking with brute force, they may employ a magical power that functions as the <i>sink</i> spell of a wizard whose level is equal to their Hit Dice. They may cast this spell but once per hour and may only use it against creatures or objects standing on an earth or stone surface. Although this is an innate power and has no casting time or components, the elemental is unable to undertake any other action in the round that it attempts to <i>sink</i> an opponent.</p><p>Grave elementals share the earth elemental's ability to lash out at buildings with earthen or stone foundations. Their attacks against such structures can be devastating and are far more effective than those made by other creatures of similar power due to the elemental's affinity for the building materials used.</p><p></p><br clear=\"all\" style=\"clear:both; height:0;\">\r\n","images":["<img src=\"grf/rv.gif\" width=\"150\" height=\"75\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Ravenloft\" title=\"Ravenloft\" align=\"right\">","<img src=\"/img/spc/eleravl1.gif\" width=\"300\" height=\"360\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Pyre and Mist Elemental\" title=\"Pyre and Mist Elemental\" style=\"float:left;\">","<img src=\"/img/spc/eleravl2.gif\" width=\"300\" height=\"360\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Blood and Grave Elemental\" title=\"Blood and Grave Elemental\" style=\"float:right\">","<img src=\"grf/add2_01.gif\" width=\"200\" height=\"56\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Advanced Dungeons & Dragons 2nd Edition\">"],"setting":"Ravenloft","statblock":{"Blood":{"Activity Cycle":"Any","Alignment":"Neutral","Armor Class":"0","Climate/Terrain":"Any Ravenloft","Damage/Attack":"3d6","Diet":"Special","Frequency":"Very Rare","Hit Dice":"8, 12, or 16","Intelligence":"Low (5-7)","Magic Resistance":"Nil","Morale":"8 HD: Champion (15-16)<br>12 HD: Champion (15-16)<br>16 HD: Fanatic (17-18)","Movement":"12","No. Appearing":"1","No. of Attacks":"1","Organization":"Solitary","Size":"8 HD: L (8' tall)<br>12 HD: L (12' tall)<br>16 HD: H (16' tall)","Special Attacks":"See below","Special Defenses":"See below","THAC0":"8 HD: 13<br>12 HD: 9<br>16 HD: 5","Treasure":"Nil","XP Value":"8 HD: 3,000<br>12 HD: 7,000<br>16 HD: 11,000"},"Grave":{"Activity Cycle":"Any","Alignment":"Neutral","Armor Class":"0","Climate/Terrain":"Any Ravenloft Graveyard","Damage/Attack":"4-40 (4d10)","Diet":"Special","Frequency":"Very rare","Hit Dice":"8, 12, or 16","Intelligence":"Low (5-7)","Magic Resistance":"Nil","Morale":"8 HD: Champion (15-16)<br>12 HD: Champion (15-16)<br>16 HD: Fanatic (17-18)","Movement":"6","No. Appearing":"1","No. of Attacks":"1","Organization":"Solitary","Size":"8 HD: L (8' tall)<br>12 HD: L (12' tall)<br>16 HD: H (16' tall)","Special Attacks":"Sink","Special Defenses":"See below","THAC0":"8 HD: 13<br>12 HD: 9<br>16 HD: 5","Treasure":"Nil","XP Value":"8 HD: 3,000<br>12 HD: 7,000<br>16 HD: 11,000"},"Mist":{"Activity Cycle":"Any","Alignment":"Neutral","Armor Class":"0","Climate/Terrain":"Any Ravenloft","Damage/Attack":"2-20 (2d10)","Diet":"Special","Frequency":"Very rare","Hit Dice":"8, 12, or 16","Intelligence":"Low (5-7)","Magic Resistance":"Nil","Morale":"8 HD: Champion (15-16)<br>12 HD: Champion (15-16)<br>16 HD: Fanatic (17-18)","Movement":"Fl 36 (A)","No. Appearing":"1","No. of Attacks":"1","Organization":"Solitary","Size":"8 HD: L (8' tall)<br>12 HD: L (12' tall)<br>16 HD: H (16' tall)","Special Attacks":"<i>Infuse evil</i>","Special Defenses":"See below","THAC0":"8 HD: 13<br>12 HD: 9<br>16 HD: 5","Treasure":"Nil","XP Value":"8 HD: 4,000<br>12 HD: 8,000<br>16 HD: 12,000"},"Pyre":{"Activity Cycle":"Any","Alignment":"Neutral","Armor Class":"0","Climate/Terrain":"Any Ravenloft land","Damage/Attack":"3d8","Diet":"Special","Frequency":"Very rare","Hit Dice":"8, 12, or 16","Intelligence":"Low (5-7)","Magic Resistance":"Nil","Morale":"8 HD: Champion (15-16)<br>12 HD: Champion (15-16)<br>16 HD: Fanatic (17-18)","Movement":"12","No. Appearing":"1","No. of Attacks":"1","Organization":"Solitary","Size":"8 HD: L (8' tall)<br>12 HD: L (12' tall)<br>16 HD: H (16' tall)","Special Attacks":"See below","Special Defenses":"See below","THAC0":"8 HD: 13<br>12 HD: 9<br>16 HD: 5","Treasure":"Nil","XP Value":"8 HD: 3,000<br>12 HD: 7,000<br>16 HD: 11,000"}},"title":"Elemental (Ravenloft)"},"sources":["2122"],"statblock_names":[],"title":"Elemental (Ravenloft)","prev_key":"eleravgi","next_key":"elevermi","monster_path":"/appendix/eleravlo"}},"staticQueryHashes":[],"slicesMap":{}}
