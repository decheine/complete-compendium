While the powers listed above are the most common, some aarakocra have different or additional powers.</p><p class=\"f\">A race of intelligent, birdlike creatures living in the deepest deserts of Athas, the rare Athasian <a href=\"/appendix/aarakocr\">aarakocra</a> spends its time soaring on thermals in search of food.</p><p>The aarakocra is 7 to 8 feet tall with a wingspan of 20 feet or more. Because of its large wingspan, an aarakocra can carry as much as 75% of its own body weight and still fly easily. An aarakocra can fly a short distance carrying a burden equaling 125% of its own body weight. The average body weight of a full grown male is 100 pounds and a female is 85 pounds.</p><p>Each wing has a &ldquo;hand&rdquo; at its midpoint, consisting of three fingers and an opposable thumb. The fourth finger forms the rigid leading edge of the wing. In flight the hands cannot be used, but on the ground the aarakocra can use its hands almost as a human would. The aarakocra's body is protected by a thin bony plate on the chest, much like a solid rib cage. Talons on its legs can be used as claws and can be retracted to reveal a second set of hands, also with three fingers and an opposable thumb. Except for the chest plate, the entire skeleton is hollow and extremely fragile.</p><p>From a distance, the Athasian aarakocra resembles a huge <a href=\"/appendix/bird\">vulture</a>. Its black eyes, set in the front of the head, provide excellent vision over a long range. The plumage is generally black with a white collar for adult males and black or brown with a smaller white collar for females. Adolescents are a mixture of brown and black. The beak is large and covers most of the head. Plumage begins at the crown of the head and is darker near the head, except for the collar. Athasian aarakocra speak their own language and the languages of vultures and other large birds. Some speak the common tongue (5% to 10% chance depending on how deep in the wastelands a tribe lives).</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Combat:</b> Aarakocra can fight in the air or on the ground. They prefer aerial combat since their bones are too fragile to withstand a solid blow from a human-sized opponent. In combat against creatures on the ground, they prefer to fly over their victim and drop weighted nets. Some aarakocra use darts to harass ground-based opponents.</p><p>If their opponents can fly, the aarakocra generally forgo the use of the net, although large groups sometimes use nets on flying creatures. Normally, aarakocra attack flying creatures with long spears, diving from above and allowing the momentum to carry the spear through the target. Such an attack doubles the damage if the aarakocra have been able to dive at least 50 feet. Only the very largest aarakocra can carry more than one of these spears, they can attack with both at once with no penalty, causing double damage on each strike. All diving attacks are made at +4 and should be treated as a charge attack. All other penalties and restrictions of charge attacks apply.</p><p>The effect of the aarakocra's nets depends on if the opponent is flying at the time it becomes entangled. Creatures on the ground that are hit by a net are entangled and unable to participate in any combat until they make a successful Strength check to get free of the net. Flying creatures hit by a net can no longer fly and immediately begin falling. If they cannot escape the net or use some magical means to arrest the fall, normal falling damage applies.</p><p>Unless victims are entangled in nets, aarakocra are cautious in ground combat. If the aarakocra outnumber their opponents they advance in a straight line and thrust with their spears. If outnumbered, or the opponents are particularly tough, the aarakocra withdraw. Victims entangled in nets are killed or incapacitated for use as food or ransom.</p><p>Athasian aarakocra are mindful of their physical limitations as well as their comparatively low psionic abilities. They do not normally initiate psionic combat. At the first sign of psionic powers from any of their victims, however, all aarakocra that have some ability will use whatever attack and defense modes they can in an attempt to destroy the threat. Large groups of is or more aarakocra may initiate psionic combat if their leaders feel they can win quickly and avoid physical combat.</p><p>In desperation, an aarakocra can attempt to bite an opponent in combat. Because of the unwieldiness of its beak, the aarakocra has a THAC0 of 18 if attacking with this appendage. Further, the birdman causes only 1d2 points of damage with the beak.</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Habitat/Society:</b> Athasian aarakocra live in tribes with 6-20 (2d8+4) members, depending on the prestige of the leader. The largest tribe ever recorded had 50 members. The tribal hunting territory depends on the size of the tribe, usually about 500 square miles for a tribe of 10 members. There are no rigid boundaries between tribes and border disputes are not uncommon.</p><p>Alignments of tribe members are similar to the alignment of the leader. A tribe that has a leader who is neutral good may have neutral good, chaotic good, lawful good, and true neutral members. A predominantly evil tribe does not recognize boundaries with other tribes and treats other tribes as inferior beings to be eliminated.</p><p>Athasian aarakocra aren't happy in enclosed spaces, but they they take refuge in a cave or building if necessary.</p><p>Nonevil tribes live in rocky aeries in the highest peaks they can find. Evil tribes are normally nomadic and use an aerie made by another tribe if they need to remain in an area for a long time, even if they have to evict the tribe that made the nest.</p><p>Aarakocra aren't friendly toward intruders in their territory, especially caravans. They try to extract a toll from the caravan for passage through the desert. Good-aligned tribes allow unhindered passage of caravans that pay a tribute. If someone refuses to pay the tribute, the aarakocra try to capture scouts or outriders from the party and hold them until an even larger tribute is paid. The payment may be either livestock or shiny objects. Aarakocra are smart enough not to be taken in by glass baubles instead of gems, although they cannot tell the difference between the more common gems and the rare ones.</p><p>Evil tribes ask for tribute and often attack a caravan whether it pays or not. Aarakocra always demand shiny objects such as stones. These tribes find humans and demihumans to be quite tasty and prefer them to other food.</p><p>Good-aligned tribes of aarakocra sometimes return a lost traveler to the edge of the desert after first removing any valuables the traveler may be carrying. On very rare occasions a tribe might return a lost group of travelers to the more frequently traveled parts of the desert, again after first taking any valuables as payment.</p><p>The oldest male is the leader of the tribal hunting party and has 4+4 Hit Dice. The oldest female is in charge of the tribal aerie and has 3+3 HD. In tribes that have more than 15 members, the next oldest aarakocra serves as shaman and has 3+3 HD; the shaman completes the triumvirate necessary for proper worship and the summoning of elementals. (Interestingly, no magic-using aarakocra has ever been recorded.) Tribes without a shaman cannot summon <a href=\"/appendix/element1\">air elementals</a>, which is an important part of aarakocra culture.</p><p>The shaman is the leader of the daily sun worship. Aarakocra worship the sun because it provides them with the thermals they need to soar in search of food. The shaman also leads the mystic rituals used to summon an air elemental. Summoning an air elemental is usually done only in preparation for the tribe's most sacred ceremony, the hunt. Small tribes must band together for this ceremony to allow the triumvirate to be formed.</p><p>The ceremony to summon an air elemental must be conducted at dawn and requires the oldest male and female to emit a highpitched keening whistle. The shaman conducts an intricate dance around them, simultaneously chanting an ancient summoning mantra.</p><p>The hunt is the final part of the initiation of adolescent aarakocra to adulthood and often takes the tribe far from their normal teritory. The target is always a <a href=\"/appendix/drakalsi\">silt drake</a>. The hunt is the only time the females leave the relative safety of the nest. Even an evil tribe will not interfere with a tribe on a hunt. An air elemental is often summoned to help find the drake, but never takes part in the actual combat. Although the adult members of the tribe take part in the initial phases of the combat, it is the initiates who deliver the final, killing blows to me drake. Scars from the hunt are considered a mark of pride among all aarakocra.</p><p>The females spend about eight months of the year incubating their eggs. Athasian aarakocra mate for life and a pair normally produces as many as 10 offspring. A female lays one egg a year. Constant incubation is not required because of the high daytime temperatures, so the females can maintain the nest and keep the tribe's treasure in order.</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Ecology:</b> Athasian aarakocra are high on the food chain and have no natural enemies other than <a href=\"/appendix/drakatha\">drakes</a>. Unless evil, aarakocra leave their own territory only to hunt the silt drake and return as soon as possible when the hunt is over. (Evil aarakocra attack others, as noted above.) Aarakocra eggs and hatchlings are sought after by wealthy land owners who wish to use the creatures as scouts and sentries. An egg can bring as much as 10 cp in Tyr's marketplace. Tribes that have had eggs or hatchlings stolen have long memories and sometimes take revenge against the thief at a later date. Captive aarakocra join any tribe they come in contact with.</p><p>Athasian aarakocra have a natural life span of 21-30 years.</p><br clear=\"all\" style=\"clear:both; height:0;\">\r\n","images":["<img src=\"grf/ds.gif\" width=\"150\" height=\"75\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Dark Sun\" title=\"Dark Sun\" align=\"right\">","<img src=\"img/aarakath.gif\" alt=\"Aarakocra (Athas)\" title=\"Aarakocra (Athas)\" border=\"0\" width=\"300\" height=\"360\" style=\"text-align:right;\" align=\"right\">","<img src=\"grf/add2_01.gif\" width=\"200\" height=\"56\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Advanced Dungeons & Dragons 2nd Edition\">"],"setting":"Dark Sun","statblock":{"Aarakocra (Athas)":{"Activity Cycle":"Day","Alignment":"Any","Armor Class":"7","Climate/Terrain":"Deep desert","Damage/Attack":"1d3/1d3 or by weapon","Diet":"Carnivore","Frequency":"Rare","Hit Dice":"2+2","Intelligence":"Average (8-10)","Magic Resistance":"Nil","Morale":"Steady (11)","Movement":"6, Fl 36 (C)","No. Appearing":"1d10","No. of Attacks":"2","Organization":"Tribal","Size":"M (20'+ wingspan)","Special Attacks":"Nil","Special Defenses":"Nil","THAC0":"17","Treasure":"Varies","XP Value":"65"}},"title":"Aarakocra (Athas)"},"sources":["2433"],"statblock_names":[],"title":"Aarakocra (Athas)","prev_key":"zygraat","next_key":"aarakocr","monster_path":"/appendix/aarakath"}}},"pageContext":{"monster_key":"eel","monster_data":{"TSR":["2103"],"fullBody":"  <table cellspacing=\"0\" cellpadding=\"0\"><tr class=\"bk\"><th> </th><th class=\"cn\">Electric</th><th class=\"cn\">Giant</th><th class=\"cn\">Marine</th><th class=\"cn\">Weed</th></tr><tr><th>Climate/Terrain:</th><td>Warm, fresh water</td><td>Warm salt and fresh water</td><td>Warm salt water</td><td>Warm fresh and salt water</td></tr><tr><th>Frequency:</th><td>Rare</td><td>Uncommon</td><td>Rare</td><td>Very rare</td></tr><tr><th>Organization:</th><td>Solitary</td><td>Solitary</td><td>Solitary</td><td>Colonies</td></tr><tr><th>Activity Cycle:</th><td>Any</td><td>Any</td><td>Any</td><td>Any</td></tr><tr><th>Diet:</th><td>Carnivore</td><td>Carnivore</td><td>Carnivore</td><td>Carnivore</td></tr><tr><th>Intelligence:</th><td>Non- (0)</td><td>Non- (0)</td><td>Non- (0)</td><td>Non- (0)</td></tr><tr><th>Treasure:</th><td>Nil</td><td>Nil</td><td>Nil</td><td>(O,P,R)</td></tr><tr><th>Alignment:</th><td>Neutral</td><td>Neutral</td><td>Neutral</td><td>Neutral</td></tr><tr><th>No. Appearing:</th><td>1-3</td><td>1-4</td><td>1</td><td>10-60</td></tr><tr><th>Armor Class:</th><td>9</td><td>6</td><td>6</td><td>8</td></tr><tr><th>Movement:</th><td>Sw 12</td><td>Sw 9</td><td>Sw 9</td><td>Sw 15</td></tr><tr><th>Hit Dice:</th><td>2</td><td>5</td><td>6 to 8</td><td>1-1</td></tr><tr><th>THAC0:</th><td>16</td><td>15</td><td>6 to 7 HD: 13<br>8 HD: 12</td><td>20</td></tr><tr><th>No. of Attacks:</th><td>1</td><td>1</td><td>1</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><th>Damage/Attack:</th><td>1-3</td><td>3-18</td><td>2-8, 3-12, or 4-16</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><th>Special Attacks:</th><td>Electric shock</td><td>Nil</td><td>Electric shock</td><td>Poison</td></tr><tr><th>Special Defenses:</th><td>Immune to electrical attacks</td><td>Nil</td><td>Nil</td><td>Camouflage</td></tr><tr><th>Magic Resistance:</th><td>Nil</td><td>Nil</td><td>Nil</td><td>Nil</td></tr><tr><th>Size:</th><td>L (9' long)</td><td>H (20' long)</td><td>H-G (20-40' long)</td><td>M (6' long)</td></tr><tr><th>Morale:</th><td>Unsteady (7)</td><td>Average (8)</td><td>Average (9)</td><td>Unsteady (6)</td></tr><tr><th>XP Value:</th><td>65</td><td>175</td><td>6 HD: 420<br>7 HD: 650<br>8 HD:975</td><td>120</td></tr></table><p class=\"f\">Eels are long, snake-like <a href=\"/appendix/fish\">fish</a> that are usually not aggressive. Nevertheless, nature has provided the various types of eels with interesting - and dangerous - methods of defense.</p><h2>Electric Eels</h2><p class=\"f\">Reaching 9' in length, the electric eel has a long, scaleless body. The eel swims using its two small pectoral fins and the long fin that stretches along 80% of its stomach, and is able to propel itself rapidly in any direction including backward. The coloration of an electric eel is mostly dull gray, though it often has a bright patch of red or green along its stomach and throat.</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Combat:</b> An attacking eel, whether in self-defense or hunting for food, will discharge a jolt of electricity. This charge has a 15-foot-radius range. Creatures less than five feet from the eel suffer 3d8 points of damage; creatures five to ten feet away receive 2d8 points of damage; all other creatures within range suffer 1d8 points of damage. An eel must recharge itself for an hour (six turns) between attacks.</p><p>If hunting, an eel will search the surrounding water for fish, frogs, or other creatures that are easily stunned or killed by its attack. As it has no teeth, an electric eel eats only small creatures it can swallow whole. If defending itself, an eel will seek to flee its attackers while they are recovering from the electric charge. The electric eel is immune to all electricity-based attacks.</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Habitat/Society:</b> Shallow, slow-moving, fresh water rivers in the warmer climates are the abodes of the electric eel. Not a social animal, the electric eel lives a solitary life when it is not breeding. However, when an eel discharges electricity, there is an 80% chance that 1-2 other nearby eels approach in the hope of securing something to eat.</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Giant Eels</b></p>  <p class=\"ni\">Giant eels usually dwell in warm salt water, though a few are found in fresh water (10%). They all have no electrical discharge attack. Instead, they attack with their teeth. Reaching up to 20' in length, these eels are ill-tempered and most often attack by darting out from a cave or crevice.</p><p></p><p class=\"f\"><b>Marine Eels</b></p>  <p class=\"ni\">These giant eels are large, salt water versions of the electric eel. Since they strike with amazing speed, marine eels receive a +1 bonus to initiative rolls. Growing from 20-40' in length, marine eels have a very powerful electrical discharge. This attack has a range of 15'; creatures less than 5' from the eel suffer 6d6 points of damage; those between five and ten feet receive 4d6 points of damage; all others in the range suffer 2d6 points of damage. Victims of the marine eel must also roll a successful saving throw vs. paralyzation or be stunned for a number of rounds equal to the damage they sustained from the electrical shock. However, the farther away a creature is from the eel, the greater its chance to save. If the victim is five to ten feet away from the eel, it gets a +1 bonus to its saving throw. Creatures ten to 15 feet away get a +2 bonus. A successful saving throw means that the victim still takes full damage. but he is not stunned by the electrical charge.</p><p></p><p class=\"f\"><b>Weed Eels</b></p>  <p class=\"ni\">These eels get their name from their remarkable resemblance to seaweed. In fact, they can be spotted by a trained observer only on a roll of 1 on 1d6. The bite of the weed eel is poisonous - victims that fail a saving throw vs. poison die in 1d4 rounds.</p><p>Weed eels are at home in both fresh and salt water, 25 to 40 feet deep. They live in loose, communal groups of 10 to 60 eels. Each colony has a lair consisting of an central cave, roughly 30' long and 20' wide and high. The floor of the central cave is covered with small stones, coins, and gems that the eels have scavenged. Radiating from this central cave are a series of six-foot-diameter tunnels, which in turn lead to a network of six- to eight-inch-diameter holes. These are the homes of the individual eels that make up the colony. Weed eels are fiercely protective of their lairs, especially the central cave where their young are raised.</p><p></p><br clear=\"all\" style=\"clear:both; height:0;\">\r\n","images":["<img src=\"grf/xx.gif\" width=\"150\" height=\"75\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Advanced Dungeons & Dragons 2nd Edition\" title=\"Advanced Dungeons & Dragons 2nd Edition\" align=\"right\">","<img src=\"grf/tsr_sm.png\" width=\"56\" height=\"59\" border=\"0\" alt=\"TSR\">"],"setting":"Advanced Dungeons & Dragons 2nd Edition","statblock":{"Electric":{"Activity Cycle":"Any","Alignment":"Neutral","Armor Class":"9","Climate/Terrain":"Warm, fresh water","Damage/Attack":"1-3","Diet":"Carnivore","Frequency":"Rare","Hit Dice":"2","Intelligence":"Non- (0)","Magic Resistance":"Nil","Morale":"Unsteady (7)","Movement":"Sw 12","No. Appearing":"1-3","No. of Attacks":"1","Organization":"Solitary","Size":"L (9' long)","Special Attacks":"Electric shock","Special Defenses":"Immune to electrical attacks","THAC0":"16","Treasure":"Nil","XP Value":"65"},"Giant":{"Activity Cycle":"Any","Alignment":"Neutral","Armor Class":"6","Climate/Terrain":"Warm salt and fresh water","Damage/Attack":"3-18","Diet":"Carnivore","Frequency":"Uncommon","Hit Dice":"5","Intelligence":"Non- (0)","Magic Resistance":"Nil","Morale":"Average (8)","Movement":"Sw 9","No. Appearing":"1-4","No. of Attacks":"1","Organization":"Solitary","Size":"H (20' long)","Special Attacks":"Nil","Special Defenses":"Nil","THAC0":"15","Treasure":"Nil","XP Value":"175"},"Marine":{"Activity Cycle":"Any","Alignment":"Neutral","Armor Class":"6","Climate/Terrain":"Warm salt water","Damage/Attack":"2-8, 3-12, or 4-16","Diet":"Carnivore","Frequency":"Rare","Hit Dice":"6 to 8","Intelligence":"Non- (0)","Magic Resistance":"Nil","Morale":"Average (9)","Movement":"Sw 9","No. Appearing":"1","No. of Attacks":"1","Organization":"Solitary","Size":"H-G (20-40' long)","Special Attacks":"Electric shock","Special Defenses":"Nil","THAC0":"6 to 7 HD: 13<br>8 HD: 12","Treasure":"Nil","XP Value":"6 HD: 420<br>7 HD: 650<br>8 HD:975"},"Weed":{"Activity Cycle":"Any","Alignment":"Neutral","Armor Class":"8","Climate/Terrain":"Warm fresh and salt water","Damage/Attack":"1","Diet":"Carnivore","Frequency":"Very rare","Hit Dice":"1-1","Intelligence":"Non- (0)","Magic Resistance":"Nil","Morale":"Unsteady (6)","Movement":"Sw 15","No. Appearing":"10-60","No. of Attacks":"1","Organization":"Colonies","Size":"M (6' long)","Special Attacks":"Poison","Special Defenses":"Camouflage","THAC0":"20","Treasure":"(O,P,R)","XP Value":"120"}},"title":"Eel"},"sources":["2103"],"statblock_names":[],"title":"Eel","prev_key":"eeaar","next_key":"eelgimor","monster_path":"/appendix/eel"}},"staticQueryHashes":[],"slicesMap":{}}
