Their origin is uncertain though the ice wizard Khahkht may have had some role in their creation. They may even be related in some fashion to the transparent-fleshed <a href=\"/appendix/ghoulank\">Nehwon ghouls</a>. They are a secretive and evil race.</p><p>Invisibles have been known to leave Stardock, riding on the backs of the <a href=\"/appendix/rayfinfl\">invisible rayfish</a>. They are allied with Khahkht in his quest for power.</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Combat:</b> Invisibles fight with ordinary weapons, which remain visible. The Stardockers never wear armor, but all attacks upon them are at -4 to hit. They often fight from the backs of their invisible rayfish and are fond of dlying past enemies, loosing missile weapons, then vanishing with a maniacal laugh.</p><p>Stardockers have a natural ability to see invisible objects and individuals and fight invisible opponents without penalty.</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Habitat/Society:</b> The xenophobic invisibles scrupulously avoid other races except when helping Khahkht in another one of his plots against civilization. Stardock is a monarchy, ruled by the stern and merciless Oomforafor and his demented son, Faroomfar.</p><p>The invisibles are served by a captive tribe of <a href=\"/appendix/icegnome\">ice gnomes</a>. The gnomes are well treated and respectful (but still slaves).</p><p>Stardock society is old and decadent. The sterility of invisible males has led to a severe decline in population and threatened the entire kingdom with collapse and extinction. Oomforafor has relevantly decided to experiment with human-invisible crossbreeding, but the results of these experiments are not known.</p><p>Stardock currency is in the form of strange gems, visible to non-Stardockers only in the dark. These gems are worth 1,000-6,000 gp each to collectors.</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Ecology:</b> Stardockers possess a humanlike physiology and - when they reveal their true form through the use of cosmetics - are entirely human-appearing. Their shape is malleable through magic; Faroomfar has a pair of wings given him by the ice wizard.</p><br clear=\"all\" style=\"clear:both; height:0;\">\r\n","images":["<img src=\"grf/lm.gif\" width=\"150\" height=\"75\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Lankhmar\" title=\"Lankhmar\" align=\"right\">","<img src=\"img/invistdo.gif\" alt=\"Invisible of Stardock\" title=\"Invisible of Stardock\" border=\"0\" width=\"300\" height=\"360\" style=\"text-align:right;\" align=\"right\">","<img src=\"grf/add2_01.gif\" width=\"200\" height=\"56\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Advanced Dungeons & Dragons 2nd Edition\">"],"setting":"Lankhmar","statblock":{"Invisible of Stardock":{"Activity Cycle":"Any","Alignment":"Neutral evil","Armor Class":"6 (10)","Climate/Terrain":"Stardock","Damage/Attack":"By weapon","Diet":"Omnivore","Frequency":"Very rare","Hit Dice":"3","Intelligence":"Average-High (8-14)","Magic Resistance":"Nil","Morale":"Champion (16)","Movement":"12","No. Appearing":"1-6 (30-300)","No. of Attacks":"1","Organization":"Kingdom","Size":"M (5-6' tall)","Special Attacks":"Nil","Special Defenses":"Invisibility","THAC0":"17","Treasure":"Q (D)","XP Value":"120"}},"title":"Invisible of Stardock"},"sources":["2137"],"statblock_names":[],"title":"Invisible of Stardock","prev_key":"invistal","next_key":"ironcobr"}},"staticQueryHashes":[],"slicesMap":{}}
