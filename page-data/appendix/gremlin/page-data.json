While the powers listed above are the most common, some aarakocra have different or additional powers.</p><p class=\"f\">A race of intelligent, birdlike creatures living in the deepest deserts of Athas, the rare Athasian <a href=\"/appendix/aarakocr\">aarakocra</a> spends its time soaring on thermals in search of food.</p><p>The aarakocra is 7 to 8 feet tall with a wingspan of 20 feet or more. Because of its large wingspan, an aarakocra can carry as much as 75% of its own body weight and still fly easily. An aarakocra can fly a short distance carrying a burden equaling 125% of its own body weight. The average body weight of a full grown male is 100 pounds and a female is 85 pounds.</p><p>Each wing has a &ldquo;hand&rdquo; at its midpoint, consisting of three fingers and an opposable thumb. The fourth finger forms the rigid leading edge of the wing. In flight the hands cannot be used, but on the ground the aarakocra can use its hands almost as a human would. The aarakocra's body is protected by a thin bony plate on the chest, much like a solid rib cage. Talons on its legs can be used as claws and can be retracted to reveal a second set of hands, also with three fingers and an opposable thumb. Except for the chest plate, the entire skeleton is hollow and extremely fragile.</p><p>From a distance, the Athasian aarakocra resembles a huge <a href=\"/appendix/bird\">vulture</a>. Its black eyes, set in the front of the head, provide excellent vision over a long range. The plumage is generally black with a white collar for adult males and black or brown with a smaller white collar for females. Adolescents are a mixture of brown and black. The beak is large and covers most of the head. Plumage begins at the crown of the head and is darker near the head, except for the collar. Athasian aarakocra speak their own language and the languages of vultures and other large birds. Some speak the common tongue (5% to 10% chance depending on how deep in the wastelands a tribe lives).</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Combat:</b> Aarakocra can fight in the air or on the ground. They prefer aerial combat since their bones are too fragile to withstand a solid blow from a human-sized opponent. In combat against creatures on the ground, they prefer to fly over their victim and drop weighted nets. Some aarakocra use darts to harass ground-based opponents.</p><p>If their opponents can fly, the aarakocra generally forgo the use of the net, although large groups sometimes use nets on flying creatures. Normally, aarakocra attack flying creatures with long spears, diving from above and allowing the momentum to carry the spear through the target. Such an attack doubles the damage if the aarakocra have been able to dive at least 50 feet. Only the very largest aarakocra can carry more than one of these spears, they can attack with both at once with no penalty, causing double damage on each strike. All diving attacks are made at +4 and should be treated as a charge attack. All other penalties and restrictions of charge attacks apply.</p><p>The effect of the aarakocra's nets depends on if the opponent is flying at the time it becomes entangled. Creatures on the ground that are hit by a net are entangled and unable to participate in any combat until they make a successful Strength check to get free of the net. Flying creatures hit by a net can no longer fly and immediately begin falling. If they cannot escape the net or use some magical means to arrest the fall, normal falling damage applies.</p><p>Unless victims are entangled in nets, aarakocra are cautious in ground combat. If the aarakocra outnumber their opponents they advance in a straight line and thrust with their spears. If outnumbered, or the opponents are particularly tough, the aarakocra withdraw. Victims entangled in nets are killed or incapacitated for use as food or ransom.</p><p>Athasian aarakocra are mindful of their physical limitations as well as their comparatively low psionic abilities. They do not normally initiate psionic combat. At the first sign of psionic powers from any of their victims, however, all aarakocra that have some ability will use whatever attack and defense modes they can in an attempt to destroy the threat. Large groups of is or more aarakocra may initiate psionic combat if their leaders feel they can win quickly and avoid physical combat.</p><p>In desperation, an aarakocra can attempt to bite an opponent in combat. Because of the unwieldiness of its beak, the aarakocra has a THAC0 of 18 if attacking with this appendage. Further, the birdman causes only 1d2 points of damage with the beak.</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Habitat/Society:</b> Athasian aarakocra live in tribes with 6-20 (2d8+4) members, depending on the prestige of the leader. The largest tribe ever recorded had 50 members. The tribal hunting territory depends on the size of the tribe, usually about 500 square miles for a tribe of 10 members. There are no rigid boundaries between tribes and border disputes are not uncommon.</p><p>Alignments of tribe members are similar to the alignment of the leader. A tribe that has a leader who is neutral good may have neutral good, chaotic good, lawful good, and true neutral members. A predominantly evil tribe does not recognize boundaries with other tribes and treats other tribes as inferior beings to be eliminated.</p><p>Athasian aarakocra aren't happy in enclosed spaces, but they they take refuge in a cave or building if necessary.</p><p>Nonevil tribes live in rocky aeries in the highest peaks they can find. Evil tribes are normally nomadic and use an aerie made by another tribe if they need to remain in an area for a long time, even if they have to evict the tribe that made the nest.</p><p>Aarakocra aren't friendly toward intruders in their territory, especially caravans. They try to extract a toll from the caravan for passage through the desert. Good-aligned tribes allow unhindered passage of caravans that pay a tribute. If someone refuses to pay the tribute, the aarakocra try to capture scouts or outriders from the party and hold them until an even larger tribute is paid. The payment may be either livestock or shiny objects. Aarakocra are smart enough not to be taken in by glass baubles instead of gems, although they cannot tell the difference between the more common gems and the rare ones.</p><p>Evil tribes ask for tribute and often attack a caravan whether it pays or not. Aarakocra always demand shiny objects such as stones. These tribes find humans and demihumans to be quite tasty and prefer them to other food.</p><p>Good-aligned tribes of aarakocra sometimes return a lost traveler to the edge of the desert after first removing any valuables the traveler may be carrying. On very rare occasions a tribe might return a lost group of travelers to the more frequently traveled parts of the desert, again after first taking any valuables as payment.</p><p>The oldest male is the leader of the tribal hunting party and has 4+4 Hit Dice. The oldest female is in charge of the tribal aerie and has 3+3 HD. In tribes that have more than 15 members, the next oldest aarakocra serves as shaman and has 3+3 HD; the shaman completes the triumvirate necessary for proper worship and the summoning of elementals. (Interestingly, no magic-using aarakocra has ever been recorded.) Tribes without a shaman cannot summon <a href=\"/appendix/element1\">air elementals</a>, which is an important part of aarakocra culture.</p><p>The shaman is the leader of the daily sun worship. Aarakocra worship the sun because it provides them with the thermals they need to soar in search of food. The shaman also leads the mystic rituals used to summon an air elemental. Summoning an air elemental is usually done only in preparation for the tribe's most sacred ceremony, the hunt. Small tribes must band together for this ceremony to allow the triumvirate to be formed.</p><p>The ceremony to summon an air elemental must be conducted at dawn and requires the oldest male and female to emit a highpitched keening whistle. The shaman conducts an intricate dance around them, simultaneously chanting an ancient summoning mantra.</p><p>The hunt is the final part of the initiation of adolescent aarakocra to adulthood and often takes the tribe far from their normal teritory. The target is always a <a href=\"/appendix/drakalsi\">silt drake</a>. The hunt is the only time the females leave the relative safety of the nest. Even an evil tribe will not interfere with a tribe on a hunt. An air elemental is often summoned to help find the drake, but never takes part in the actual combat. Although the adult members of the tribe take part in the initial phases of the combat, it is the initiates who deliver the final, killing blows to me drake. Scars from the hunt are considered a mark of pride among all aarakocra.</p><p>The females spend about eight months of the year incubating their eggs. Athasian aarakocra mate for life and a pair normally produces as many as 10 offspring. A female lays one egg a year. Constant incubation is not required because of the high daytime temperatures, so the females can maintain the nest and keep the tribe's treasure in order.</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Ecology:</b> Athasian aarakocra are high on the food chain and have no natural enemies other than <a href=\"/appendix/drakatha\">drakes</a>. Unless evil, aarakocra leave their own territory only to hunt the silt drake and return as soon as possible when the hunt is over. (Evil aarakocra attack others, as noted above.) Aarakocra eggs and hatchlings are sought after by wealthy land owners who wish to use the creatures as scouts and sentries. An egg can bring as much as 10 cp in Tyr's marketplace. Tribes that have had eggs or hatchlings stolen have long memories and sometimes take revenge against the thief at a later date. Captive aarakocra join any tribe they come in contact with.</p><p>Athasian aarakocra have a natural life span of 21-30 years.</p><p></p><br clear=\"all\" style=\"clear:both; height:0;\">\r\n","images":["<img src=\"grf/ds.gif\" width=\"150\" height=\"75\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Dark Sun\" title=\"Dark Sun\" align=\"right\">","<img src=\"img/aarakath.gif\" alt=\"Aarakocra (Athas)\" title=\"Aarakocra (Athas)\" border=\"0\" width=\"300\" height=\"360\" style=\"text-align:right;\" align=\"right\">","<img src=\"grf/add2_01.gif\" width=\"200\" height=\"56\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Advanced Dungeons & Dragons 2nd Edition\">"],"setting":"Dark Sun","statblock":{"Aarakocra (Athas)":{"Activity Cycle":"Day","Alignment":"Any","Armor Class":"7","Climate/Terrain":"Deep desert","Damage/Attack":"1d3/1d3 or by weapon","Diet":"Carnivore","Frequency":"Rare","Hit Dice":"2+2","Intelligence":"Average (8-10)","Magic Resistance":"Nil","Morale":"Steady (11)","Movement":"6, Fl 36 (C)","No. Appearing":"1d10","No. of Attacks":"2","Organization":"Tribal","Size":"M (20'+ wingspan)","Special Attacks":"Nil","Special Defenses":"Nil","THAC0":"17","Treasure":"Varies","XP Value":"65"}},"title":"Aarakocra (Athas)"},"sources":["2433"],"statblock_names":[],"title":"Aarakocra (Athas)","prev_key":"zygraat","next_key":"aarakocr","monster_path":"/appendix/aarakath"}}},"pageContext":{"monster_key":"gremlin","monster_data":{"TSR":["2140","2107"],"fullBody":"  <table cellspacing=\"0\" cellpadding=\"0\"><tr class=\"bk\"><th> </th><th class=\"cn\">Gremlin</th><th class=\"cn\">Fremlin</th><th class=\"cn\">Galltrit</th><th class=\"cn\">Mite</th><th class=\"cn\">Snyad</th></tr><tr><th>Climate/Terrain:</th><td>Any land</td><td>Any land</td><td>Any land</td><td>Subterranean</td><td>Subterranean</td></tr><tr><th>Frequency:</th><td>Very rare</td><td>Very rare</td><td>Very rare</td><td>Rare</td><td>Uncommon</td></tr><tr><th>Organization:</th><td>Pack</td><td>Pack</td><td>Pack</td><td>Tribe</td><td>Family</td></tr><tr><th>Activity Cycle:</th><td>Night</td><td>Day</td><td>Night</td><td>Any</td><td>Any</td></tr><tr><th>Diet:</th><td>Omnivore</td><td>Herbivore</td><td>Blood</td><td>Omnivore</td><td>Omnivore</td></tr><tr><th>Intelligence:</th><td>Very (11-12)</td><td>Average (8-10)</td><td>Average <nobr>(8-10)</nobr></td><td>Low (5-7)</td><td>Low (5-7)</td></tr><tr><th>Treasure:</th><td>Q,X</td><td>X</td><td>Q</td><td>K (C)</td><td>J (I)</td></tr><tr><th>Alignment:</th><td>Chaotic evil</td><td>Chaotic neutral</td><td>Chaotic evil</td><td>Lawful evil</td><td>Neutral</td></tr><tr><th>No. Appearing:</th><td>1-6</td><td>1-4</td><td>1-4</td><td>6-24</td><td>1-8</td></tr><tr><th>Armor Class:</th><td>4</td><td>6</td><td>2</td><td>8</td><td>-4</td></tr><tr><th>Movement:</th><td>6, Fl 18 (B)</td><td>6, Fl 12 (B)</td><td>6, Fl 18 (B)</td><td>3</td><td>21</td></tr><tr><th>Hit Dice:</th><td>4</td><td>3+6</td><td>2 hp</td><td>1-1</td><td>1-1</td></tr><tr><th>THAC0:</th><td>17</td><td>17</td><td>20</td><td>20</td><td>20</td></tr><tr><th>No. of Attacks:</th><td>1</td><td>1</td><td>1</td><td>1</td><td>Nil</td></tr><tr><th>Damage/Attack:</th><td>1-4</td><td>1-4</td><td>1-2</td><td>1-3</td><td>Nil</td></tr><tr><th>Special Attacks:</th><td>Nil</td><td>Nil</td><td>Blood drain</td><td>Nil</td><td>Nil</td></tr><tr><th>Special Defenses:</th><td>+1 weapon needed to hit</td><td>+1 weapon needed to hit</td><td>Nil</td><td>Nil</td><td>See below</td></tr><tr><th>Magic Resistance:</th><td>25%</td><td>Nil</td><td>Nil</td><td>Nil</td><td>See below</td></tr><tr><th>Size:</th><td>T (18&rdquo;)</td><td>T (1')</td><td>T (6&rdquo;)</td><td>T (2')</td><td>T (2')</td></tr><tr><th>Morale:</th><td>Unsteady (5-7)</td><td>Unsteady (5-7)</td><td>Average <nobr>(8-10)</nobr></td><td>Average <nobr>(8-10)</nobr></td><td>Average <nobr>(8-10)</nobr></td></tr><tr><th>XP Value:</th><td>650</td><td>270</td><td>65</td><td>35</td><td>65</td></tr></table><p class=\"f\">Often mistaken for <a href=\"/appendix/imp\">imps</a>, gremlins are small, winged goblinoids. There are many varieties of gremlins, and most are chaotic and mischievous. Their skin color ranges from brown to black to gray, frequently in a mottled blend. Their ears are very large and pointed, giving them a 65% chance to hear noise. A pair of bat-like wings enables them to fly or glide. Gremlins never wear clothing or ornamentation.</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Combat:</b> Gremlins are worthless in real combat; at every opportunity they flee rather than fight face-to-face. What gremlins like to do best is cause trouble. The angrier their victims are, the happier the gremlins. Their favorite tactic is to set up a trap to humiliate opponents and maybe even cause them to damage a valued possession or hurt a loved one. If the opponent gets hurt as well, that's just fine. For example, the gremlin may set a trip wire across a doorway that pulls down a fragile vase onto the victim's head. A building infested by a gremlin pack can be reduced to shambles in a single night.</p><p>In melee, gremlins have only their weak bite for attacks (1d4 points of damage). They can fly quite well (MC B), but they usually stay close to the ground or well over their opponents' heads, where they are difficult to reach. They can be hit only by magical weapons, and are 25% resistant to magic. Despite these defenses, they are cowards and fight only if cornered.</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Habitat/Society:</b> Gremlins are magical creatures that originated in an unknown plane of existence. They are highly susceptible to mutation and can interbreed with any goblinoid species. This has resulted in several different gremlin races, each with slightly different abilities and natures.</p><p>Gremlins travel in small packs, and they have a highly organized social order. Each gremlin knows who is above him in social rank, and who is below. As a rule, this is ordered by hit points, but an aggressive gremlin with lower hit points may be above larger gremlins in the social standing. Males and females are indistinguishable to all but other gremlins. Both sexes participate equally in all things. Offspring are left to fend for themselves from birth, which they are fully capable of doing. Within a month, the gremlin is a fully matured adult. Fortunately, they do not mate often.</p><p>These obnoxious creatures usually look for a building or estate to infest. Although they flee individual combat, they will not leave the building or grounds they infest until it is no longer fun (when everything is broken and the inhabitants have fled), or until their lives are in danger. Since the gremlins take great pains to not be seen, except as fleeting shadows, the inhabitants are frequently convinced that the place is haunted.</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Ecology:</b> Gremlins are not a natural part of the ecology. Their immunity to normal weapons protects them from normal predators. Unmolested, they live for centuries.</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Fremlin</b></p>  <p class=\"ni\">These friendly gremlins are quite harmless. They tend to be plump, whiny, and lazy, but otherwise look like small, slate colored gremlins. Occasionally, they become tolerable companions, if they take a liking to someone and are well fed and entertained. Even in this case, they never assist in combat and may in fact hinder it by giving away the location of hiding characters or making other such blunders.</p><p></p><p class=\"f\"><b>Galltrit</b></p>  <p class=\"ni\">These nasty little stone-gray creatures live in areas of dung, carrion, or offal. Because of their small size and coloration, they are detected only on a 1 in 8 chance (1 in 6 for elves). They attack anything that disturbs them. Galltrit attempt to gain surprise and bite (with a +3 bonus to the attack roll if they have surprise) somewhere unobtrusive. An anesthetic in their saliva prevents their victims from feeling the bite, rather like a vampire <a href=\"/appendix/bat\">bat</a>.</p><p>Once locked on, galltrits suck 1 hit point of blood per round for a full turn, if undisturbed. If challenged in any way, the galltrits flee. This loss of blood reduces the victim's Constitution by 1 point for every 4 hit points of blood lost. If the victim loses 3 or more points of Constitution, usually due to multiple galltrits, he faints from the sudden blood loss. It takes two full turns to awaken and two weeks to regain the lost Constitution points.</p><p></p><p class=\"f\"><b>Mite</b></p>  <p class=\"ni\">Mites are tiny, mischievous, wingless gremlins that waylay dungeon adventurers for fun and profit. Mites have hairless, warty skin varying in color from light gray to bright violet. Their heads are triangular, with bat-like ears and a long, hooked nose. Male mites sport a bone ridge down the center of their skulls and short goatee beards. Many wear filthy rags stolen from previous victims. Their voices are high-pitched and twittery, conveying only the simplest ideas to each other; nongremlin races cannot make sense of their language.</p><p>Mites try to catch lone travelers and stragglers using pit traps (1d6 points of damage to the victim), nets (successful saving throw vs. paralysis or the victim is caught), and trip wires (successful Dexterity check or the victim falls prone). Mites swarm over prone or netted victims, and pummel them with weighted clubs (2% cumulative chance, per club, of stunning the victim, but only if the victim is in armor worse than splint mail). The mites bind their unconscious victims head and foot, and drag them into their lair. Once inside the lair, the victims are teased and chattered at for one to four days until the mites get bored. The mites then stun their victim again, steal all their possessions and deposit them at a random place - often one that causes the victims great discomfort or embarrassment.</p><p>Mite lairs consist of dozens of interconnecting corridors built above and below main dungeon corridors. Numerous entrances connect the mite tunnels to the dungeon, but all are hidden by carefully placed stones (check for secret doors to find a mite tunnel entrance). Mite corridors are tiny by human and demi-human standards; man-sized and larger creatures suffer a -4 attack roll penalty and a +4 Armor Class penalty when fighting in a mite tunnel.</p><p>Mites are small and quick. They scurry to and fro through their tunnels, stopping briefly to spy on the main tunnel, always chattering and twittering to themselves.</p><p>Deep inside the mite tunnel system is a single, large chamber with a low-ceiling. The mite king lives here, sitting on his tiny throne, dressed in baggy clothes stolen from previous victims. The mite king is a fierce (by mite standards) warrior with 1+1 Hit Dice. His bite causes 1d4 points of damage. Also in the chamber are 4d6 mite females and 4d6 mite children. The women have 1-2 Hit Dice and bite for 1-2 points of damage. The children are non-combatants.</p><p>The chamber itself is filthy and strewn with captured weapons, armor, and clothes. Coins and such are carelessly thrown about, but mites love bright, shiny gems. These are kept by the king, who is allowed to play with them anytime he wants. Mites are mischievous and curious. They pore for hours over every little stolen item, poking and prodding, bending and tasting, until either they grow bored, or, more likely, the item breaks. They delight in wearing clothes several dozen sizes too large. Mites are fond of bones, and they sometimes drag the skulls of great monsters into their lair.</p><p>Mites hunt vermin and other pests, but they love to eat iron rations which they consider a delicacy. Mites are viewed as bite-sized snacks by most monsters. Evil giants sometimes feature them as appetizers.</p><p></p><p class=\"f\"><b>Snyad</b></p>  <p class=\"ni\">Snyads are distant relatives of mites. Their love of treasure often compels them to steal from humans and demihumans. Snyads resemble mites, but they are slightly larger (2&#189; feet tall), have full, though messy, heads of hair, and are light brown in color.</p><p>Snyads speak no known language but seem to communicate with mites successfully. These two creatures sometimes team up, with the mites distracting the victim, while the snyads dart in and grab things. Snyads steal with great skill, surprising their targets 90% of the time, often snatching items directly from a person's hand (the victim gets a successful Wisdom check to hold onto the item), then zipping back into their holes and hiding until the pursuers leave. Spotting the entrance to a snyad lair requires a successful search roll: a 1-in-3 chance for elves and a 1-in-4 chance for all others.</p><p>Snyads never attack, relying on their amazingly quick reflexes to escape combat. They are not particularly strong, and any human or demi-human character with a Strength greater than 11 can capture a snyad with a successful attack roll. Captured snyads kick and scream, squirming and twisting to get away, but never bite, (for fear that the captor might bite back). Because of their high Dexterity, snyads gain a +3 bonus to their saving throws vs. non-area-effect spells. Snyads live in immediate families, marrying for life.</p><p></p><br clear=\"all\" style=\"clear:both; height:0;\">\r\n","images":["<img src=\"grf/xx.gif\" width=\"150\" height=\"75\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Advanced Dungeons & Dragons 2nd Edition\" title=\"Advanced Dungeons & Dragons 2nd Edition\" align=\"right\">","<img src=\"img/gremlin.gif\" alt=\"Gremlin\" title=\"Gremlin\" border=\"0\" width=\"300\" height=\"360\" style=\"text-align:right;\" align=\"right\">","<img src=\"grf/tsr_sm.png\" width=\"56\" height=\"59\" border=\"0\" alt=\"TSR\">"],"setting":"Advanced Dungeons & Dragons 2nd Edition","statblock":{"Fremlin":{"Activity Cycle":"Day","Alignment":"Chaotic neutral","Armor Class":"6","Climate/Terrain":"Any land","Damage/Attack":"1-4","Diet":"Herbivore","Frequency":"Very rare","Hit Dice":"3+6","Intelligence":"Average (8-10)","Magic Resistance":"Nil","Morale":"Unsteady (5-7)","Movement":"6, Fl 12 (B)","No. Appearing":"1-4","No. of Attacks":"1","Organization":"Pack","Size":"T (1')","Special Attacks":"Nil","Special Defenses":"+1 weapon needed to hit","THAC0":"17","Treasure":"X","XP Value":"270"},"Galltrit":{"Activity Cycle":"Night","Alignment":"Chaotic evil","Armor Class":"2","Climate/Terrain":"Any land","Damage/Attack":"1-2","Diet":"Blood","Frequency":"Very rare","Hit Dice":"2 hp","Intelligence":"Average <nobr>(8-10)</nobr>","Magic Resistance":"Nil","Morale":"Average <nobr>(8-10)</nobr>","Movement":"6, Fl 18 (B)","No. Appearing":"1-4","No. of Attacks":"1","Organization":"Pack","Size":"T (6&rdquo;)","Special Attacks":"Blood drain","Special Defenses":"Nil","THAC0":"20","Treasure":"Q","XP Value":"65"},"Gremlin":{"Activity Cycle":"Night","Alignment":"Chaotic evil","Armor Class":"4","Climate/Terrain":"Any land","Damage/Attack":"1-4","Diet":"Omnivore","Frequency":"Very rare","Hit Dice":"4","Intelligence":"Very (11-12)","Magic Resistance":"25%","Morale":"Unsteady (5-7)","Movement":"6, Fl 18 (B)","No. Appearing":"1-6","No. of Attacks":"1","Organization":"Pack","Size":"T (18&rdquo;)","Special Attacks":"Nil","Special Defenses":"+1 weapon needed to hit","THAC0":"17","Treasure":"Q,X","XP Value":"650"},"Mite":{"Activity Cycle":"Any","Alignment":"Lawful evil","Armor Class":"8","Climate/Terrain":"Subterranean","Damage/Attack":"1-3","Diet":"Omnivore","Frequency":"Rare","Hit Dice":"1-1","Intelligence":"Low (5-7)","Magic Resistance":"Nil","Morale":"Average <nobr>(8-10)</nobr>","Movement":"3","No. Appearing":"6-24","No. of Attacks":"1","Organization":"Tribe","Size":"T (2')","Special Attacks":"Nil","Special Defenses":"Nil","THAC0":"20","Treasure":"K (C)","XP Value":"35"},"Snyad":{"Activity Cycle":"Any","Alignment":"Neutral","Armor Class":"-4","Climate/Terrain":"Subterranean","Damage/Attack":"Nil","Diet":"Omnivore","Frequency":"Uncommon","Hit Dice":"1-1","Intelligence":"Low (5-7)","Magic Resistance":"See below","Morale":"Average <nobr>(8-10)</nobr>","Movement":"21","No. Appearing":"1-8","No. of Attacks":"Nil","Organization":"Family","Size":"T (2')","Special Attacks":"Nil","Special Defenses":"See below","THAC0":"20","Treasure":"J (I)","XP Value":"65"}},"title":"Gremlin"},"sources":["2140","2107"],"statblock_names":[],"title":"Gremlin","prev_key":"gremjerm","next_key":"griffon","monster_path":"/appendix/gremlin"}},"staticQueryHashes":[],"slicesMap":{}}
