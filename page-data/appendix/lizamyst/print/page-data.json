While the powers listed above are the most common, some aarakocra have different or additional powers.</p><p class=\"f\">A race of intelligent, birdlike creatures living in the deepest deserts of Athas, the rare Athasian <a href=\"/appendix/aarakocr\">aarakocra</a> spends its time soaring on thermals in search of food.</p><p>The aarakocra is 7 to 8 feet tall with a wingspan of 20 feet or more. Because of its large wingspan, an aarakocra can carry as much as 75% of its own body weight and still fly easily. An aarakocra can fly a short distance carrying a burden equaling 125% of its own body weight. The average body weight of a full grown male is 100 pounds and a female is 85 pounds.</p><p>Each wing has a &ldquo;hand&rdquo; at its midpoint, consisting of three fingers and an opposable thumb. The fourth finger forms the rigid leading edge of the wing. In flight the hands cannot be used, but on the ground the aarakocra can use its hands almost as a human would. The aarakocra's body is protected by a thin bony plate on the chest, much like a solid rib cage. Talons on its legs can be used as claws and can be retracted to reveal a second set of hands, also with three fingers and an opposable thumb. Except for the chest plate, the entire skeleton is hollow and extremely fragile.</p><p>From a distance, the Athasian aarakocra resembles a huge <a href=\"/appendix/bird\">vulture</a>. Its black eyes, set in the front of the head, provide excellent vision over a long range. The plumage is generally black with a white collar for adult males and black or brown with a smaller white collar for females. Adolescents are a mixture of brown and black. The beak is large and covers most of the head. Plumage begins at the crown of the head and is darker near the head, except for the collar. Athasian aarakocra speak their own language and the languages of vultures and other large birds. Some speak the common tongue (5% to 10% chance depending on how deep in the wastelands a tribe lives).</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Combat:</b> Aarakocra can fight in the air or on the ground. They prefer aerial combat since their bones are too fragile to withstand a solid blow from a human-sized opponent. In combat against creatures on the ground, they prefer to fly over their victim and drop weighted nets. Some aarakocra use darts to harass ground-based opponents.</p><p>If their opponents can fly, the aarakocra generally forgo the use of the net, although large groups sometimes use nets on flying creatures. Normally, aarakocra attack flying creatures with long spears, diving from above and allowing the momentum to carry the spear through the target. Such an attack doubles the damage if the aarakocra have been able to dive at least 50 feet. Only the very largest aarakocra can carry more than one of these spears, they can attack with both at once with no penalty, causing double damage on each strike. All diving attacks are made at +4 and should be treated as a charge attack. All other penalties and restrictions of charge attacks apply.</p><p>The effect of the aarakocra's nets depends on if the opponent is flying at the time it becomes entangled. Creatures on the ground that are hit by a net are entangled and unable to participate in any combat until they make a successful Strength check to get free of the net. Flying creatures hit by a net can no longer fly and immediately begin falling. If they cannot escape the net or use some magical means to arrest the fall, normal falling damage applies.</p><p>Unless victims are entangled in nets, aarakocra are cautious in ground combat. If the aarakocra outnumber their opponents they advance in a straight line and thrust with their spears. If outnumbered, or the opponents are particularly tough, the aarakocra withdraw. Victims entangled in nets are killed or incapacitated for use as food or ransom.</p><p>Athasian aarakocra are mindful of their physical limitations as well as their comparatively low psionic abilities. They do not normally initiate psionic combat. At the first sign of psionic powers from any of their victims, however, all aarakocra that have some ability will use whatever attack and defense modes they can in an attempt to destroy the threat. Large groups of is or more aarakocra may initiate psionic combat if their leaders feel they can win quickly and avoid physical combat.</p><p>In desperation, an aarakocra can attempt to bite an opponent in combat. Because of the unwieldiness of its beak, the aarakocra has a THAC0 of 18 if attacking with this appendage. Further, the birdman causes only 1d2 points of damage with the beak.</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Habitat/Society:</b> Athasian aarakocra live in tribes with 6-20 (2d8+4) members, depending on the prestige of the leader. The largest tribe ever recorded had 50 members. The tribal hunting territory depends on the size of the tribe, usually about 500 square miles for a tribe of 10 members. There are no rigid boundaries between tribes and border disputes are not uncommon.</p><p>Alignments of tribe members are similar to the alignment of the leader. A tribe that has a leader who is neutral good may have neutral good, chaotic good, lawful good, and true neutral members. A predominantly evil tribe does not recognize boundaries with other tribes and treats other tribes as inferior beings to be eliminated.</p><p>Athasian aarakocra aren't happy in enclosed spaces, but they they take refuge in a cave or building if necessary.</p><p>Nonevil tribes live in rocky aeries in the highest peaks they can find. Evil tribes are normally nomadic and use an aerie made by another tribe if they need to remain in an area for a long time, even if they have to evict the tribe that made the nest.</p><p>Aarakocra aren't friendly toward intruders in their territory, especially caravans. They try to extract a toll from the caravan for passage through the desert. Good-aligned tribes allow unhindered passage of caravans that pay a tribute. If someone refuses to pay the tribute, the aarakocra try to capture scouts or outriders from the party and hold them until an even larger tribute is paid. The payment may be either livestock or shiny objects. Aarakocra are smart enough not to be taken in by glass baubles instead of gems, although they cannot tell the difference between the more common gems and the rare ones.</p><p>Evil tribes ask for tribute and often attack a caravan whether it pays or not. Aarakocra always demand shiny objects such as stones. These tribes find humans and demihumans to be quite tasty and prefer them to other food.</p><p>Good-aligned tribes of aarakocra sometimes return a lost traveler to the edge of the desert after first removing any valuables the traveler may be carrying. On very rare occasions a tribe might return a lost group of travelers to the more frequently traveled parts of the desert, again after first taking any valuables as payment.</p><p>The oldest male is the leader of the tribal hunting party and has 4+4 Hit Dice. The oldest female is in charge of the tribal aerie and has 3+3 HD. In tribes that have more than 15 members, the next oldest aarakocra serves as shaman and has 3+3 HD; the shaman completes the triumvirate necessary for proper worship and the summoning of elementals. (Interestingly, no magic-using aarakocra has ever been recorded.) Tribes without a shaman cannot summon <a href=\"/appendix/element1\">air elementals</a>, which is an important part of aarakocra culture.</p><p>The shaman is the leader of the daily sun worship. Aarakocra worship the sun because it provides them with the thermals they need to soar in search of food. The shaman also leads the mystic rituals used to summon an air elemental. Summoning an air elemental is usually done only in preparation for the tribe's most sacred ceremony, the hunt. Small tribes must band together for this ceremony to allow the triumvirate to be formed.</p><p>The ceremony to summon an air elemental must be conducted at dawn and requires the oldest male and female to emit a highpitched keening whistle. The shaman conducts an intricate dance around them, simultaneously chanting an ancient summoning mantra.</p><p>The hunt is the final part of the initiation of adolescent aarakocra to adulthood and often takes the tribe far from their normal teritory. The target is always a <a href=\"/appendix/drakalsi\">silt drake</a>. The hunt is the only time the females leave the relative safety of the nest. Even an evil tribe will not interfere with a tribe on a hunt. An air elemental is often summoned to help find the drake, but never takes part in the actual combat. Although the adult members of the tribe take part in the initial phases of the combat, it is the initiates who deliver the final, killing blows to me drake. Scars from the hunt are considered a mark of pride among all aarakocra.</p><p>The females spend about eight months of the year incubating their eggs. Athasian aarakocra mate for life and a pair normally produces as many as 10 offspring. A female lays one egg a year. Constant incubation is not required because of the high daytime temperatures, so the females can maintain the nest and keep the tribe's treasure in order.</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Ecology:</b> Athasian aarakocra are high on the food chain and have no natural enemies other than <a href=\"/appendix/drakatha\">drakes</a>. Unless evil, aarakocra leave their own territory only to hunt the silt drake and return as soon as possible when the hunt is over. (Evil aarakocra attack others, as noted above.) Aarakocra eggs and hatchlings are sought after by wealthy land owners who wish to use the creatures as scouts and sentries. An egg can bring as much as 10 cp in Tyr's marketplace. Tribes that have had eggs or hatchlings stolen have long memories and sometimes take revenge against the thief at a later date. Captive aarakocra join any tribe they come in contact with.</p><p>Athasian aarakocra have a natural life span of 21-30 years.</p><br clear=\"all\" style=\"clear:both; height:0;\">\r\n","images":["<img

lizard live on Mystara, ranging from the harmless to the deadly. Some species can be trained for use as mounts by a character with the animal training non-weapon proficiency who has chosen to train lizards.</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Draco Lizard</b></p>  <p class=\"ni\">With its scaly skin and fearsome face, the 6-foot-long draco lizard looks draconian - its appearance explains how this creature got its name. Its head is bright red; this coloration fades to vellow at the neck, then gradually becomes green toward the rear. While the draco lizard lacks wings, it does have wide flaps of skin between its legs, with which it can glide through the air like a flying squirrel.</p><p>The draco lizard is a carnivore, and it favors unintelligent prey. Nonetheless, a hungry draco may drop from a high perch to attack a human or demihuman morsel. (Such a victim suffers a -3 penalty to surprise.) Draco lizards can be trained for hunting and guarding but will not cany riders.</p><p></p><p class=\"f\"><b><img src=\"/img/spc/lizamys1.gif\" width=\"300\" height=\"360\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Giant Footpad Lizard\" title=\"Giant Footpad Lizard\" style=\"float:left;\">Giant Footpad Lizard</b></p>  <p class=\"ni\">The giant footpad lizard is an 8-Foot-long, slender reptile with slate gray coloration and small ridges on its back. The lizard's body seems rather flat, compared to other specimens.</p><p>Long, spindly legs characterize this lizard, as do its long toes that end in round, sticky pads. These pads, combined with the creature's agility and low body weight, make the footpad lizard an excellent climber. The creatures can cope with all but the smoothest surfaces, at any angle up to vertical.</p><p>If captured and trained while young, footpad lizards can make excellent mounts or pack animals. Subterranean races such as gnomes prize these giant lizards for their surefootedness in precarious cavern environments.</p><p>While bearing a rider, a aiant footpad lizard cannot climb slopes steeper &an 60 degGes. The lizard can carry as much weight as a pony (maximum 320 pounds).</p><p>Some wizards and alchemists use giant footpad lizard hides to help create gauntelts of swimming and climbing.</p><p></p><p class=\"f\"><b>Giant Gecko</b></p>  <p class=\"ni\">The 5-foot-long giant gecko is pale blue with orange-brown spots. The creatures find <a href=\"/appendix/insect\">giant insects</a> and <a href=\"/appendix/spider\">spiders</a> quite tasty; in fact, these lizards are common only in areas frequented by giant arthropods. Preferring to hunt their quarry at night, geckos have natural adhesive pads on their toes that help them climb trees or walls rapidly, then drop onto prey. Geckos employing this tactic penalize victims' surprise rolls by -2.</p><p>Giant geckos can learn to work as guard animals.</p><p></p><p class=\"f\"><b>Horned Chameleon</b></p>  <p class=\"ni\">The horned charneleon, a 7-foot-long lizard with a tail another 10 feet long, changes color to blend in with its surroundings. Opponents suffer a -5 penalty to their surprise rolls.</p><p>A very aggressive lizard known to attack people with no provocation, the homed chameleon enjoys employing its sticky tongue, which can shoot out up to 5 feet. A successful hit means the chameleon has pulled the victim into its mouth and bitten, inflicting 2d4 hit points of damage.</p><p>The creature also attacks with its horn, causing 1d6 points of damage. Further, it can use its tail to knock down attackers within 10 feet. A tail strike requires a successful attack roll for each victim. While such &ldquo;knock-downs&rdquo; cause no damage, victims lose their next round of attacks.</p><p></p><p class=\"f\"><b>Lava Lizard</b></p>  <p class=\"ni\">A strange reptile, the lava lizard lives in subterranean caverns amid pools of bubbling magma. The creature has a rocklike outer shell that helps maintain the high body temperature it needs to survive.</p><p>Most lava lizards have reddish brown bides. Brieht red lumps on their outer shells resemble hot coals, and their eyes glow pale yellow. A smoky odor hangs about them.</p><p>A lava lizard attacks by biting with its quick but relatively weak jaws. A bitten creature suffers 1d6 points of damage and must make a saving throw vs. breath weapon. Failing the save means that the lizard holds the victim fast in its jaws for that round, inflicting an additional 1d6 points of heat damage. Magical means of fire resistance, such as rings, potions, and spells, can reduce this extra damage. Lava lizards remain immune to normal and magical fires.</p><p>Whenever a lava lizard is struck by a nonmagical metal weapon, the attacker must make a saving throw for the item using the &ldquo;magical fire&rdquo; category of the item saving throw chart. A failed saving throw means the weapon melts due to the lizard�s intense heat. The melted weapon still causes damage on that round, but becomes useless afterward.</p><p>Although these creatures dwell in hot subterranean caverns, they can wander several miles away from the life-sustaining heat the lava pools produce. They cannot stay away for long, however. Stories tell of lava lizards found frozen like statues, presumably having suayed too far from their heat sources.</p><p></p><p class=\"f\"><b><img src=\"/img/spc/lizamyst.gif\" width=\"300\" height=\"360\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Rockhome Lizard\" title=\"Rockhome Lizard\" style=\"float:right;\">Rockhome</b></p>  <p class=\"ni\">The rockhome lizard is a gentle creature commonly found in terranean colonies of dwarves or gnomes. Possibly an ancestor of the <a href=\"/appendix/lizarman\">lizard man</a>, it stands on two legs and seem roughly as intelligent as a domesticated <a href=\"/appendix/dog\">dog</a>.</p><p>All rockhomes can run very fast. They have long forelimbs for catching prey and strong jaws. Coloration varies from white to whitish hues of green and blue.</p><p>As they thrive in captivity, these repriles can learn to perform simple tasks. They catch <a href=\"/appendix/rat\">rats</a>, carry riders, pull wagons or carts, and run in large wheels to power machines.</p><p>Unfortunately, rockhome lizards do not get along well with <a href=\"/appendix/horse\">horses</a>: The species seem to scare each other. In addition, they die if exposed to sunlight, suffering 1d6 points of damage per hour of exposure until dead.</p><p></p><p class=\"f\"><b>Giant Tuatara</b></p>  <p class=\"ni\">An 8-foot-long lizard that looks like a cross between an iguana and a toad is the giant tuatara. Wbite spikes along its back protrude from olive-colored, pebbly bide. Tuataras have a temperature-sensitive membrane over their eyes which, when lowered, allows the lizards to &ldquo;see&rdquo; in darkness (90-foot infravision).</p><p>Tuataras love to hunt small animals at night and sleep during the day. They aggressively attack people who wander too close to their lairs.</p><p>Although these lizards can be trained to attack, the spines along their backs make them poor mounts.</p><p></p><p class=\"f\"><b>Xytar</b></p>  <p class=\"ni\">Because of xytars' fiery breath, inexperienced travelers sometimes mistake these 8-foot-long lizardlike creatures for <a href=\"/appendix/dragon\">dragons</a>.</p><p>Xytar hides, though predominantly yellow, bear red and orange mottling along the back. Xvtars have six legs and long, toothy jaws. They dwell in hot desert areas and can go without water for weeks.</p><p>The carnivorous xytars hunt in packs, often targeting passing caravans and settlements on the fringes of deserts. Xytars attack either with their strong jaws or their breath weapon. They can breathe a cone of fire 30 feet long and 10 feet wide at the base, causing 10d4 bit points of damage; creatures in the area of effect take only half damage if they make a successful saving throw. A favorite xytar tactic involves first breathing fire to &ldquo;soften up&rdquo; the victims, then dosing in to snap and bite in melee. Alchemists seek out the throat sacs that create the lizards' fire, using them to concoct <i>potions of fiery breath</i>.</p><p>With much difficulty, xytars can be trained to attack (+4 penalty to proficiency checks). The creatures must be raised by their trainers and will not respond to aiyone else. Only <a href=\"/appendix/lizkinmy\">sis'thik lizard-kin</a> are known to commonly raise Xytars.</p><p></p><br clear=\"all\" style=\"clear:both; height:0;\">\r\n","images":["<img src=\"grf/ms.gif\" width=\"150\" height=\"75\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Mystara\" title=\"Mystara\" align=\"right\">","<img src=\"/img/spc/lizamys1.gif\" width=\"300\" height=\"360\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Giant Footpad Lizard\" title=\"Giant Footpad Lizard\" style=\"float:left;\">","<img src=\"/img/spc/lizamyst.gif\" width=\"300\" height=\"360\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Rockhome Lizard\" title=\"Rockhome Lizard\" style=\"float:right;\">","<img src=\"grf/add2_01.gif\" width=\"200\" height=\"56\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Advanced Dungeons & Dragons 2nd Edition\">"],"setting":"Mystara","statblock":{"Draco":{"Activity Cycle":"Any","Alignment":"Neutral","Armor Class":"5","Climate/Terrain":"Temperate forests and hills","Damage/Attack":"1d10 (bite)","Diet":"Carnivore","Frequency":"Uncommon","Hit Dice":"4+2","Intelligence":"Semi- (2)","Magic Resistance":"Nil","Morale":"Average (9)","Movement":"12, Glide 15","No. Appearing":"1d4","No. of Attacks":"1","Organization":"Pack","Size":"M (6' long)","Special Attacks":"Surprise","Special Defenses":"Nil","THAC0":"17","Treasure":"U","XP Value":"420"},"Footpad (giant)":{"Activity Cycle":"Any","Alignment":"Neutral","Armor Class":"6","Climate/Terrain":"Temperate hills and subterranean","Damage/Attack":"1d6 (bite)","Diet":"Omnivore","Frequency":"Rare","Hit Dice":"2+1","Intelligence":"Semi- (2)","Magic Resistance":"Nil","Morale":"Average (9)","Movement":"12, Cl 6","No. Appearing":"1d3","No. of Attacks":"1","Organization":"Pack","Size":"L (8' long)","Special Attacks":"Nil","Special Defenses":"Climb walls","THAC0":"19","Treasure":"Nil","XP Value":"120"},"Gecko (giant)":{"Activity Cycle":"Night","Alignment":"Neutral","Armor Class":"5","Climate/Terrain":"Temperate forests and urban","Damage/Attack":"1d8 (bite)","Diet":"Carnivore","Frequency":"Uncommon","Hit Dice":"3+1","Intelligence":"Semi- (2)","Magic Resistance":"Nil","Morale":"Average (9)","Movement":"12, Cl 6","No. Appearing":"1d6","No. of Attacks":"1","Organization":"Pack","Size":"M (5' long)","Special Attacks":"Surprise","Special Defenses":"Climb walls","THAC0":"17","Treasure":"U","XP Value":"270"},"Horned Chameleon":{"Activity Cycle":"Day","Alignment":"Neutral","Armor Class":"2","Climate/Terrain":"Temperate forests and hills","Damage/Attack":"2d4 (bite)/1d6 (horn)","Diet":"Carnivore","Frequency":"Uncommon","Hit Dice":"5","Intelligence":"Semi- (2)","Magic Resistance":"Nil","Morale":"Average (10)","Movement":"12","No. Appearing":"1d3","No. of Attacks":"2","Organization":"Pack","Size":"L (7' long)","Special Attacks":"Surprise, tail sweep","Special Defenses":"Nil","THAC0":"15","Treasure":"U","XP Value":"420"},"Lava":{"Activity Cycle":"Any","Alignment":"Neutral","Armor Class":"3","Climate/Terrain":"Volcanlc subterranean caverns","Damage/Attack":"1d6 (bite)","Diet":"Carnivore","Frequency":"Very rare","Hit Dice":"4","Intelligence":"Semi- (2)","Magic Resistance":"Nil","Morale":"Champion (15)","Movement":"9","No. Appearing":"1","No. of Attacks":"1","Organization":"Solitary","Size":"M (6' long)","Special Attacks":"Heat","Special Defenses":"Weapon melt, fire immunity","THAC0":"17","Treasure":"Nil","XP Value":"420"},"Rockhome":{"Activity Cycle":"Any","Alignment":"Neutral","Armor Class":"5","Climate/Terrain":"Nonarctic subterranean caverns","Damage/Attack":"1d6 (bite)","Diet":"Omnivore","Frequency":"Common","Hit Dice":"3","Intelligence":"Semi- (2-4)","Magic Resistance":"Nil","Morale":"Average (10)","Movement":"15","No. Appearing":"2d4","No. of Attacks":"1","Organization":"Pack","Size":"L (9' tall)","Special Attacks":"Nil","Special Defenses":"Nil","THAC0":"17","Treasure":"Nil","XP Value":"65"},"Tuatara (giant)":{"Activity Cycle":"Night","Alignment":"Neutral","Armor Class":"4","Climate/Terrain":"Dry temperate plains","Damage/Attack":"1d6 (bite)","Diet":"Carnivore","Frequency":"Uncommon","Hit Dice":"6","Intelligence":"Semi- (2)","Magic Resistance":"Nil","Morale":"Average (8)","Movement":"9","No. Appearing":"1d2","No. of Attacks":"1","Organization":"Pack","Size":"L (8' long)","Special Attacks":"Nil","Special Defenses":"Nil","THAC0":"15","Treasure":"V","XP Value":"270"},"Xytar":{"Activity Cycle":"Day","Alignment":"Neutral","Armor Class":"3","Climate/Terrain":"Subtropical or tropxal desert","Damage/Attack":"1d10 (bite)","Diet":"Carnivore","Frequency":"Rare","Hit Dice":"5+1","Intelligence":"Semi- (4)","Magic Resistance":"Nil","Morale":"Elite (13)","Movement":"12","No. Appearing":"1d6","No. of Attacks":"1","Organization":"Pack","Size":"L (8' long)","Special Attacks":"Breath weapon","Special Defenses":"Nil","THAC0":"15","Treasure":"Nil","XP Value":"650"}},"title":"Lizard (Mystara)"},"sources":["2501"],"statblock_names":[],"title":"Lizard (Mystara)","prev_key":"liviwall","next_key":"lizard","monster_path":"/appendix/lizamyst"}},"staticQueryHashes":[],"slicesMap":{}}
