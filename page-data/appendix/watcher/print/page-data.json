While the powers listed above are the most common, some aarakocra have different or additional powers.</p><p class=\"f\">A race of intelligent, birdlike creatures living in the deepest deserts of Athas, the rare Athasian <a href=\"/appendix/aarakocr\">aarakocra</a> spends its time soaring on thermals in search of food.</p><p>The aarakocra is 7 to 8 feet tall with a wingspan of 20 feet or more. Because of its large wingspan, an aarakocra can carry as much as 75% of its own body weight and still fly easily. An aarakocra can fly a short distance carrying a burden equaling 125% of its own body weight. The average body weight of a full grown male is 100 pounds and a female is 85 pounds.</p><p>Each wing has a &ldquo;hand&rdquo; at its midpoint, consisting of three fingers and an opposable thumb. The fourth finger forms the rigid leading edge of the wing. In flight the hands cannot be used, but on the ground the aarakocra can use its hands almost as a human would. The aarakocra's body is protected by a thin bony plate on the chest, much like a solid rib cage. Talons on its legs can be used as claws and can be retracted to reveal a second set of hands, also with three fingers and an opposable thumb. Except for the chest plate, the entire skeleton is hollow and extremely fragile.</p><p>From a distance, the Athasian aarakocra resembles a huge <a href=\"/appendix/bird\">vulture</a>. Its black eyes, set in the front of the head, provide excellent vision over a long range. The plumage is generally black with a white collar for adult males and black or brown with a smaller white collar for females. Adolescents are a mixture of brown and black. The beak is large and covers most of the head. Plumage begins at the crown of the head and is darker near the head, except for the collar. Athasian aarakocra speak their own language and the languages of vultures and other large birds. Some speak the common tongue (5% to 10% chance depending on how deep in the wastelands a tribe lives).</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Combat:</b> Aarakocra can fight in the air or on the ground. They prefer aerial combat since their bones are too fragile to withstand a solid blow from a human-sized opponent. In combat against creatures on the ground, they prefer to fly over their victim and drop weighted nets. Some aarakocra use darts to harass ground-based opponents.</p><p>If their opponents can fly, the aarakocra generally forgo the use of the net, although large groups sometimes use nets on flying creatures. Normally, aarakocra attack flying creatures with long spears, diving from above and allowing the momentum to carry the spear through the target. Such an attack doubles the damage if the aarakocra have been able to dive at least 50 feet. Only the very largest aarakocra can carry more than one of these spears, they can attack with both at once with no penalty, causing double damage on each strike. All diving attacks are made at +4 and should be treated as a charge attack. All other penalties and restrictions of charge attacks apply.</p><p>The effect of the aarakocra's nets depends on if the opponent is flying at the time it becomes entangled. Creatures on the ground that are hit by a net are entangled and unable to participate in any combat until they make a successful Strength check to get free of the net. Flying creatures hit by a net can no longer fly and immediately begin falling. If they cannot escape the net or use some magical means to arrest the fall, normal falling damage applies.</p><p>Unless victims are entangled in nets, aarakocra are cautious in ground combat. If the aarakocra outnumber their opponents they advance in a straight line and thrust with their spears. If outnumbered, or the opponents are particularly tough, the aarakocra withdraw. Victims entangled in nets are killed or incapacitated for use as food or ransom.</p><p>Athasian aarakocra are mindful of their physical limitations as well as their comparatively low psionic abilities. They do not normally initiate psionic combat. At the first sign of psionic powers from any of their victims, however, all aarakocra that have some ability will use whatever attack and defense modes they can in an attempt to destroy the threat. Large groups of is or more aarakocra may initiate psionic combat if their leaders feel they can win quickly and avoid physical combat.</p><p>In desperation, an aarakocra can attempt to bite an opponent in combat. Because of the unwieldiness of its beak, the aarakocra has a THAC0 of 18 if attacking with this appendage. Further, the birdman causes only 1d2 points of damage with the beak.</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Habitat/Society:</b> Athasian aarakocra live in tribes with 6-20 (2d8+4) members, depending on the prestige of the leader. The largest tribe ever recorded had 50 members. The tribal hunting territory depends on the size of the tribe, usually about 500 square miles for a tribe of 10 members. There are no rigid boundaries between tribes and border disputes are not uncommon.</p><p>Alignments of tribe members are similar to the alignment of the leader. A tribe that has a leader who is neutral good may have neutral good, chaotic good, lawful good, and true neutral members. A predominantly evil tribe does not recognize boundaries with other tribes and treats other tribes as inferior beings to be eliminated.</p><p>Athasian aarakocra aren't happy in enclosed spaces, but they they take refuge in a cave or building if necessary.</p><p>Nonevil tribes live in rocky aeries in the highest peaks they can find. Evil tribes are normally nomadic and use an aerie made by another tribe if they need to remain in an area for a long time, even if they have to evict the tribe that made the nest.</p><p>Aarakocra aren't friendly toward intruders in their territory, especially caravans. They try to extract a toll from the caravan for passage through the desert. Good-aligned tribes allow unhindered passage of caravans that pay a tribute. If someone refuses to pay the tribute, the aarakocra try to capture scouts or outriders from the party and hold them until an even larger tribute is paid. The payment may be either livestock or shiny objects. Aarakocra are smart enough not to be taken in by glass baubles instead of gems, although they cannot tell the difference between the more common gems and the rare ones.</p><p>Evil tribes ask for tribute and often attack a caravan whether it pays or not. Aarakocra always demand shiny objects such as stones. These tribes find humans and demihumans to be quite tasty and prefer them to other food.</p><p>Good-aligned tribes of aarakocra sometimes return a lost traveler to the edge of the desert after first removing any valuables the traveler may be carrying. On very rare occasions a tribe might return a lost group of travelers to the more frequently traveled parts of the desert, again after first taking any valuables as payment.</p><p>The oldest male is the leader of the tribal hunting party and has 4+4 Hit Dice. The oldest female is in charge of the tribal aerie and has 3+3 HD. In tribes that have more than 15 members, the next oldest aarakocra serves as shaman and has 3+3 HD; the shaman completes the triumvirate necessary for proper worship and the summoning of elementals. (Interestingly, no magic-using aarakocra has ever been recorded.) Tribes without a shaman cannot summon <a href=\"/appendix/element1\">air elementals</a>, which is an important part of aarakocra culture.</p><p>The shaman is the leader of the daily sun worship. Aarakocra worship the sun because it provides them with the thermals they need to soar in search of food. The shaman also leads the mystic rituals used to summon an air elemental. Summoning an air elemental is usually done only in preparation for the tribe's most sacred ceremony, the hunt. Small tribes must band together for this ceremony to allow the triumvirate to be formed.</p><p>The ceremony to summon an air elemental must be conducted at dawn and requires the oldest male and female to emit a highpitched keening whistle. The shaman conducts an intricate dance around them, simultaneously chanting an ancient summoning mantra.</p><p>The hunt is the final part of the initiation of adolescent aarakocra to adulthood and often takes the tribe far from their normal teritory. The target is always a <a href=\"/appendix/drakalsi\">silt drake</a>. The hunt is the only time the females leave the relative safety of the nest. Even an evil tribe will not interfere with a tribe on a hunt. An air elemental is often summoned to help find the drake, but never takes part in the actual combat. Although the adult members of the tribe take part in the initial phases of the combat, it is the initiates who deliver the final, killing blows to me drake. Scars from the hunt are considered a mark of pride among all aarakocra.</p><p>The females spend about eight months of the year incubating their eggs. Athasian aarakocra mate for life and a pair normally produces as many as 10 offspring. A female lays one egg a year. Constant incubation is not required because of the high daytime temperatures, so the females can maintain the nest and keep the tribe's treasure in order.</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Ecology:</b> Athasian aarakocra are high on the food chain and have no natural enemies other than <a href=\"/appendix/drakatha\">drakes</a>. Unless evil, aarakocra leave their own territory only to hunt the silt drake and return as soon as possible when the hunt is over. (Evil aarakocra attack others, as noted above.) Aarakocra eggs and hatchlings are sought after by wealthy land owners who wish to use the creatures as scouts and sentries. An egg can bring as much as 10 cp in Tyr's marketplace. Tribes that have had eggs or hatchlings stolen have long memories and sometimes take revenge against the thief at a later date. Captive aarakocra join any tribe they come in contact with.</p><p>Athasian aarakocra have a natural life span of 21-30 years.</p><p></p><br clear=\"all\" style=\"clear:both; height:0;\">\r\n","images":["<img src=\"grf/ds.gif\" width=\"150\" height=\"75\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Dark Sun\" title=\"Dark Sun\" align=\"right\">","<img src=\"img/aarakath.gif\" alt=\"Aarakocra (Athas)\" title=\"Aarakocra (Athas)\" border=\"0\" width=\"300\" height=\"360\" style=\"text-align:right;\" align=\"right\">","<img src=\"grf/add2_01.gif\" width=\"200\" height=\"56\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Advanced Dungeons & Dragons 2nd Edition\">"],"setting":"Dark Sun","statblock":{"Aarakocra (Athas)":{"Activity Cycle":"Day","Alignment":"Any","Armor Class":"7","Climate/Terrain":"Deep desert","Damage/Attack":"1d3/1d3 or by weapon","Diet":"Carnivore","Frequency":"Rare","Hit Dice":"2+2","Intelligence":"Average (8-10)","Magic Resistance":"Nil","Morale":"Steady (11)","Movement":"6, Fl 36 (C)","No. Appearing":"1d10","No. of Attacks":"2","Organization":"Tribal","Size":"M (20'+ wingspan)","Special Attacks":"Nil","Special Defenses":"Nil","THAC0":"17","Treasure":"Varies","XP Value":"65"}},"title":"Aarakocra (Athas)"},"sources":["2433"],"statblock_names":[],"title":"Aarakocra (Athas)","prev_key":"zygraat","next_key":"aarakocr","monster_path":"/appendix/aarakath"}}},"pageContext":{"monster_key":"watcher","monster_data":{"TSR":["9280"],"fullBody":"  <table cellspacing=\"0\" cellpadding=\"0\"><tr><th>Climate/Terrain:</th>  <td>Any space, very rarely worlds</td></tr><tr><th>Frequency:</th>        <td>Rare</td></tr><tr><th>Organization:</th>     <td>Solitary (telepathic clan links)</td></tr><tr><th>Activity Cycle:</th>   <td>Any</td></tr><tr><th>Diet:</th>             <td>Gems and refined metals</td></tr><tr><th>Intelligence:</th>     <td>Supra-genius (20)</td></tr><tr><th>Treasure:</th>         <td>V,T,X</td></tr><tr><th>Alignment:</th>        <td>Chaotic good</td></tr><tr><th>No. Appearing:</th>    <td>1 or 1-4</td></tr><tr><th>Armor Class:</th>      <td>5</td></tr><tr><th>Movement:</th>         <td>6, Fl 20 (A), Sw 18</td></tr><tr><th>Hit Dice:</th>         <td>8+8</td></tr><tr><th>THAC0:</th>            <td>13</td></tr><tr><th>No. of Attacks:</th>   <td>2</td></tr><tr><th>Damage/Attack:</th>    <td>2-12/2 per round/1-2</td></tr><tr><th>Special Attacks:</th>  <td>Spell use</td></tr><tr><th>Special Defenses:</th> <td>Regeneration (see below)</td></tr><tr><th>Magic Resistance:</th> <td>36% plus intelligence-related spell immunities</td></tr><tr><th>Size:</th>             <td>H (16'-24' long)</td></tr><tr><th>Morale:</th>           <td>Elite (15-16)</td></tr><tr><th>XP Value:</th>         <td>6,000</td></tr></table><p class=\"f\">Sarphardin resemble nagas, with snakelike prehensile bodies and huge dragon-like reptilian heads. They are curious and whimsical in nature, and have the natural ability to travel through space by spelljamming (without helm or ship, although one can carry a ship of 20 tons or less with it, as long as it remains in direct physical contact with the vessel). Groups of sarphardin working together can move vessels of up to 100 tons through space. They cannot cooperate with <i>spelljamming helms</i> or other power sources to increase the SR of a ship, but can use any helm they touch as though they were human spellcasters.</p><p>This ability has made them very helpful to adventurers in need of rescue-and deadly pursuers when they hunt down and slay foes.</p><p>Sarphardin regenerate damage at the rate of 1 hit point every four rounds.</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Combat:</b> In battle, sarphardin use their strong jaws (2-12 dmg) to bite opponents, whom they entangle or slap (1-2 dmg, plus successful Strength Check or be knocked over; if drifting in space, sent tumbling head-over-heels).</p><p>A sarphardin is scaled, and its head is covered with bony plates and ridges (hence the more-agile body and the morearmored head share the same armor class).</p><p>A sarphardin can make an entangle attempt once per round by making a successful attack roll. Entangled targets can be hit automatically by all sarphardin attacks (bite and spell use). At the end of the first round of entanglement and every round thereafter, however, a target is allowed a Strength Check to break free. If it succeeds, freedom is gained, and only 1 point of constriction damage is suffered that round. If it fails, 2 points of constriction damage are suffered, and constriction continues.</p><p>In addition to its physical attacks, a sarphardin can cast one spell per round. The spell-power of a sarphardin is equal to that of a 7th-level wizard: four 1st-level, three 2nd-level, and two 3rd-level spells, and one 4th-level spell.</p><p>Sarphardin use verbal-only spells, which they largely acquire by using <i>invisibility</i> spells to spy on world-bound beings using spells, and bringing treasures to world-bound beings in exchange for tutoring in a new, desired spell in verbal-only form. Sarphardin speak the common tongue and a hissing, purring language of their own.</p><p>Sarphardin can also use potions, scrolls, and all magical items allowed to both warriors (e.g., magic swords) and wizards (e.g., most wands) that they can hold in their prehensile tails and command verbally or by effort of will.</p><p>The high intelligence and wisdom of sarphardin renders them immune to illusion spells of 1st-3rd level, and to the spells cause <i>fear</i>, <i>command</i>, <i>forget</i>, <i>friends</i>, <i>hypnotism</i>, <i>ray of enfeeblement</i>, and scare. They are not \"persons\" for the purposes of charm and hold magics, but can be affected by the stronger \"monster\" versions of those spells.</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Habitat/Society:</b> Sarphardin are almost always encountered in space as solitary wanderers, watching others. Watching sarphardin will do nothing except cock their heads, bob and weave to see better, and emit a purring 'mmm-hmmm' noise. They will defend themselves if attacked, but often merely dodge 'warning shots' or hurled objects, and drift a little closer to watch with renewed interest.</p><p>Sarphardin are essentially passive. They approach life as an entertainment, and each sarphardin is determined to see the best ongoing show it can. Space-battles and large-scale disasters often attract a crowd of calmly-watching, floating sarphardin.</p><p>Sarphardin never fight others of their kind. They cannot be coerced or duped into doing so; illusions or magical controls will be shattered if an attempt is made, for a sarphardin can always tell another sarphardin, however disguised.</p><p>Sarphardin are bisexual, and give live birth to tiny, softscaled young. Mating and child-rearing take place in wellhidden enclaves in jungles on obscure worlds, or in deep caverns in rogue planets drifting in little-traveled areas of the flow. Sarphardin in these places will hide from or avoid intruders, using their magic to escape if necessary.</p><p>All sarphardin are 'family;' that is, all are members of a single clan, to which all sarphardin are intensely loyal. Sarphardin have in the past pretended to be willing to provide others of their kind to neogi and illithid slavers-but invariably the slavers (who planned to seize the bargaining sarphardin as well) have found themselves maneuvered into the ambush of an elven armada, or the midst of a beholder flotilla.</p><img src=\"/img/spc/watcher1.gif\" style=\"column-span: all\"/><p>Of all the races of space, elvenkind have the closest dealings with sarphardin. Dwarves, gnomes, and humans are regarded as less trustworthy, but better (particularly the latter two races) at providing a sarphardin with entertainment.</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Ecology:</b> Sarphardin require little air, and can tolerate a wide variety of atmospheres, breathing fouled atmospheres as if they were clean, and deadly air as if it was merely foul. When spelljamming, they typically slow down to skim planetary atmospheres from time to time (If one is acting as the spelljamming figurehead of a ship, it will be considerate enough to choose an atmosphere breathable by those aboard the ship).</p><p>Sarphardin eat minerals, both gems and refined metals (such as coinage), and will always want to be paid to effect a rescue, spelljam a ship, or aid someone in battle (worth about 1,000 gp to a sarphardin, 3,000-4,000 gp, and 2,500- 5,000, respectively).</p><p>Sarphardin prefer to bargain first, perform, then get payment in full-spelljamming a ship to a world where the captain and crew have money stashed to pay for the 'jamming would be fine. Someone who declines to pay after reaching a bargain with a sarphardin will simply be ignored, forever after, by all sarphardin. They will not speak to, bargain with, or aid such an individual, and if the black-listed being is rescued with others, the fee will be at least 1,000 gp higher (in rare cases, this ban has been lifted after the transgressor has pleadingly and handsomely made amends-called \"kissing the snake\" in spacer lingo).</p><p>Sarphardin have a 2-mile-range telepathy with other sarphardin. Others can join this communications network by exercise of natural power or by magic, but it occurs on a level where other telepathy is not usually found, and must be magically or mentally searched for, for at least 1d4 rounds, to establish contact.</p><p>Sarphardin brains are used in spell inks for spells concerned with mental communications, and some whisper that the Arcane work with sarphardin to make helms (the two races have amicable relations, sarphardin often carrying Arcane through space).</p><p>Sarphardin skin, scaly and tough in life, shrivels to uselessness upon death. The flesh beneath, however, is said to be very nourishing (a 10 pound chunk can feed an active warrior for one month), decays very slowly, and is prized by alchemists and wizards.</p><p>When spelljamming, sarphardin have a personal Ship Rating of 4, and give a towed ship this SR (If two sarphardin combine to tow a ship of larger than 30 tons, it has an SR of 3 while under tow).</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Skullsnake</b> </p><p class=\"f\">Undead sarphardin have been encountered. Skeletal and evil, seeking to destroy all non-sarphardin life, these are believed to have been created by evil humans and magic-using <a href=\"/appendix/beholde1\">beholders</a>.</p><p>Skullsnakes retain the use of their spells and physical attacks, and their skeletal bites gain an additional 1d10 points of life-force-draining, chilling damage. Their morale rises to Fearless ( 19-20); they turn as \"Special.\" Their rate of regeneration slows to 1 hit point per turn. The XP Value of a Skullsnake is 7,000.</p>\n","images":["<img src=\"grf/sj.gif\" width=\"150\" height=\"75\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Spelljammer\" title=\"Spelljammer\" align=\"right\">","<img src=\"img/watcher.gif\" alt=\"Sarphardin (Watcher)\" title=\"Sarphardin (Watcher)\" border=\"0\" width=\"300\" height=\"360\" style=\"text-align:right;\" align=\"right\">","<img src=\"/img/spc/watcher1.gif\" style=\"column-span: all\"/>","<img src=\"grf/tsr_sm.png\" width=\"56\" height=\"59\" border=\"0\" alt=\"TSR\">"],"setting":"Spelljammer","statblock":{"Sarphardin (Watcher)":{"Activity Cycle":"Any","Alignment":"Chaotic good","Armor Class":"5","Climate/Terrain":"Any space, very rarely worlds","Damage/Attack":"2-12/2 per round/1-2","Diet":"Gems and refined metals","Frequency":"Rare","Hit Dice":"8+8","Intelligence":"Supra-genius (20)","Magic Resistance":"36% plus intelligence-related spell immunities","Morale":"Elite (15-16)","Movement":"6, Fl 20 (A), Sw 18","No. Appearing":"1 or 1-4","No. of Attacks":"2","Organization":"Solitary (telepathic clan links)","Size":"H (16'-24' long)","Special Attacks":"Spell use","Special Defenses":"Regeneration (see below)","THAC0":"13","Treasure":"V,T,X","XP Value":"6,000"}},"title":"Sarphardin (Watcher)"},"sources":["9280"],"statblock_names":[],"title":"Sarphardin (Watcher)","prev_key":"watcghos","next_key":"watcspid","monster_path":"/appendix/watcher"}},"staticQueryHashes":[],"slicesMap":{}}
