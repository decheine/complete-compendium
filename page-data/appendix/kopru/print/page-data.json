While the powers listed above are the most common, some aarakocra have different or additional powers.</p><p class=\"f\">A race of intelligent, birdlike creatures living in the deepest deserts of Athas, the rare Athasian <a href=\"/appendix/aarakocr\">aarakocra</a> spends its time soaring on thermals in search of food.</p><p>The aarakocra is 7 to 8 feet tall with a wingspan of 20 feet or more. Because of its large wingspan, an aarakocra can carry as much as 75% of its own body weight and still fly easily. An aarakocra can fly a short distance carrying a burden equaling 125% of its own body weight. The average body weight of a full grown male is 100 pounds and a female is 85 pounds.</p><p>Each wing has a &ldquo;hand&rdquo; at its midpoint, consisting of three fingers and an opposable thumb. The fourth finger forms the rigid leading edge of the wing. In flight the hands cannot be used, but on the ground the aarakocra can use its hands almost as a human would. The aarakocra's body is protected by a thin bony plate on the chest, much like a solid rib cage. Talons on its legs can be used as claws and can be retracted to reveal a second set of hands, also with three fingers and an opposable thumb. Except for the chest plate, the entire skeleton is hollow and extremely fragile.</p><p>From a distance, the Athasian aarakocra resembles a huge <a href=\"/appendix/bird\">vulture</a>. Its black eyes, set in the front of the head, provide excellent vision over a long range. The plumage is generally black with a white collar for adult males and black or brown with a smaller white collar for females. Adolescents are a mixture of brown and black. The beak is large and covers most of the head. Plumage begins at the crown of the head and is darker near the head, except for the collar. Athasian aarakocra speak their own language and the languages of vultures and other large birds. Some speak the common tongue (5% to 10% chance depending on how deep in the wastelands a tribe lives).</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Combat:</b> Aarakocra can fight in the air or on the ground. They prefer aerial combat since their bones are too fragile to withstand a solid blow from a human-sized opponent. In combat against creatures on the ground, they prefer to fly over their victim and drop weighted nets. Some aarakocra use darts to harass ground-based opponents.</p><p>If their opponents can fly, the aarakocra generally forgo the use of the net, although large groups sometimes use nets on flying creatures. Normally, aarakocra attack flying creatures with long spears, diving from above and allowing the momentum to carry the spear through the target. Such an attack doubles the damage if the aarakocra have been able to dive at least 50 feet. Only the very largest aarakocra can carry more than one of these spears, they can attack with both at once with no penalty, causing double damage on each strike. All diving attacks are made at +4 and should be treated as a charge attack. All other penalties and restrictions of charge attacks apply.</p><p>The effect of the aarakocra's nets depends on if the opponent is flying at the time it becomes entangled. Creatures on the ground that are hit by a net are entangled and unable to participate in any combat until they make a successful Strength check to get free of the net. Flying creatures hit by a net can no longer fly and immediately begin falling. If they cannot escape the net or use some magical means to arrest the fall, normal falling damage applies.</p><p>Unless victims are entangled in nets, aarakocra are cautious in ground combat. If the aarakocra outnumber their opponents they advance in a straight line and thrust with their spears. If outnumbered, or the opponents are particularly tough, the aarakocra withdraw. Victims entangled in nets are killed or incapacitated for use as food or ransom.</p><p>Athasian aarakocra are mindful of their physical limitations as well as their comparatively low psionic abilities. They do not normally initiate psionic combat. At the first sign of psionic powers from any of their victims, however, all aarakocra that have some ability will use whatever attack and defense modes they can in an attempt to destroy the threat. Large groups of is or more aarakocra may initiate psionic combat if their leaders feel they can win quickly and avoid physical combat.</p><p>In desperation, an aarakocra can attempt to bite an opponent in combat. Because of the unwieldiness of its beak, the aarakocra has a THAC0 of 18 if attacking with this appendage. Further, the birdman causes only 1d2 points of damage with the beak.</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Habitat/Society:</b> Athasian aarakocra live in tribes with 6-20 (2d8+4) members, depending on the prestige of the leader. The largest tribe ever recorded had 50 members. The tribal hunting territory depends on the size of the tribe, usually about 500 square miles for a tribe of 10 members. There are no rigid boundaries between tribes and border disputes are not uncommon.</p><p>Alignments of tribe members are similar to the alignment of the leader. A tribe that has a leader who is neutral good may have neutral good, chaotic good, lawful good, and true neutral members. A predominantly evil tribe does not recognize boundaries with other tribes and treats other tribes as inferior beings to be eliminated.</p><p>Athasian aarakocra aren't happy in enclosed spaces, but they they take refuge in a cave or building if necessary.</p><p>Nonevil tribes live in rocky aeries in the highest peaks they can find. Evil tribes are normally nomadic and use an aerie made by another tribe if they need to remain in an area for a long time, even if they have to evict the tribe that made the nest.</p><p>Aarakocra aren't friendly toward intruders in their territory, especially caravans. They try to extract a toll from the caravan for passage through the desert. Good-aligned tribes allow unhindered passage of caravans that pay a tribute. If someone refuses to pay the tribute, the aarakocra try to capture scouts or outriders from the party and hold them until an even larger tribute is paid. The payment may be either livestock or shiny objects. Aarakocra are smart enough not to be taken in by glass baubles instead of gems, although they cannot tell the difference between the more common gems and the rare ones.</p><p>Evil tribes ask for tribute and often attack a caravan whether it pays or not. Aarakocra always demand shiny objects such as stones. These tribes find humans and demihumans to be quite tasty and prefer them to other food.</p><p>Good-aligned tribes of aarakocra sometimes return a lost traveler to the edge of the desert after first removing any valuables the traveler may be carrying. On very rare occasions a tribe might return a lost group of travelers to the more frequently traveled parts of the desert, again after first taking any valuables as payment.</p><p>The oldest male is the leader of the tribal hunting party and has 4+4 Hit Dice. The oldest female is in charge of the tribal aerie and has 3+3 HD. In tribes that have more than 15 members, the next oldest aarakocra serves as shaman and has 3+3 HD; the shaman completes the triumvirate necessary for proper worship and the summoning of elementals. (Interestingly, no magic-using aarakocra has ever been recorded.) Tribes without a shaman cannot summon <a href=\"/appendix/element1\">air elementals</a>, which is an important part of aarakocra culture.</p><p>The shaman is the leader of the daily sun worship. Aarakocra worship the sun because it provides them with the thermals they need to soar in search of food. The shaman also leads the mystic rituals used to summon an air elemental. Summoning an air elemental is usually done only in preparation for the tribe's most sacred ceremony, the hunt. Small tribes must band together for this ceremony to allow the triumvirate to be formed.</p><p>The ceremony to summon an air elemental must be conducted at dawn and requires the oldest male and female to emit a highpitched keening whistle. The shaman conducts an intricate dance around them, simultaneously chanting an ancient summoning mantra.</p><p>The hunt is the final part of the initiation of adolescent aarakocra to adulthood and often takes the tribe far from their normal teritory. The target is always a <a href=\"/appendix/drakalsi\">silt drake</a>. The hunt is the only time the females leave the relative safety of the nest. Even an evil tribe will not interfere with a tribe on a hunt. An air elemental is often summoned to help find the drake, but never takes part in the actual combat. Although the adult members of the tribe take part in the initial phases of the combat, it is the initiates who deliver the final, killing blows to me drake. Scars from the hunt are considered a mark of pride among all aarakocra.</p><p>The females spend about eight months of the year incubating their eggs. Athasian aarakocra mate for life and a pair normally produces as many as 10 offspring. A female lays one egg a year. Constant incubation is not required because of the high daytime temperatures, so the females can maintain the nest and keep the tribe's treasure in order.</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Ecology:</b> Athasian aarakocra are high on the food chain and have no natural enemies other than <a href=\"/appendix/drakatha\">drakes</a>. Unless evil, aarakocra leave their own territory only to hunt the silt drake and return as soon as possible when the hunt is over. (Evil aarakocra attack others, as noted above.) Aarakocra eggs and hatchlings are sought after by wealthy land owners who wish to use the creatures as scouts and sentries. An egg can bring as much as 10 cp in Tyr's marketplace. Tribes that have had eggs or hatchlings stolen have long memories and sometimes take revenge against the thief at a later date. Captive aarakocra join any tribe they come in contact with.</p><p>Athasian aarakocra have a natural life span of 21-30 years.</p>\n","images":["<img src=\"grf/ds.gif\" width=\"150\" height=\"75\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Dark Sun\" title=\"Dark Sun\" align=\"right\">","<img src=\"img/aarakath.gif\" alt=\"Aarakocra (Athas)\" title=\"Aarakocra (Athas)\" border=\"0\" width=\"300\" height=\"360\" style=\"text-align:right;\" align=\"right\">","<img src=\"grf/add2_01.gif\" width=\"200\" height=\"56\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Advanced Dungeons & Dragons 2nd Edition\">"],"setting":"Dark Sun","statblock":{"Aarakocra (Athas)":{"Activity Cycle":"Day","Alignment":"Any","Armor Class":"7","Climate/Terrain":"Deep desert","Damage/Attack":"1d3/1d3 or by weapon","Diet":"Carnivore","Frequency":"Rare","Hit Dice":"2+2","Intelligence":"Average (8-10)","Magic Resistance":"Nil","Morale":"Steady (11)","Movement":"6, Fl 36 (C)","No. Appearing":"1d10","No. of Attacks":"2","Organization":"Tribal","Size":"M (20'+ wingspan)","Special Attacks":"Nil","Special Defenses":"Nil","THAC0":"17","Treasure":"Varies","XP Value":"65"}},"title":"Aarakocra (Athas)"},"sources":["2433"],"statblock_names":[],"title":"Aarakocra (Athas)","prev_key":"zygraat","next_key":"aarakocr","monster_path":"/appendix/aarakath"}}},"pageContext":{"monster_key":"kopru","monster_data":{"TSR":["2501"],"fullBody":"  <table cellspacing=\"0\" cellpadding=\"0\"><tr><th>Climate/Terrain:</th><td>Tropical oceans and swamps</td></tr><tr><th>Frequency:</th><td>Rare</td></tr><tr><th>Organization:</th><td>Pack</td></tr><tr><th>Activity Cycle:</th><td>Any</td></tr><tr><th>Diet:</th><td>Omnivore</td></tr><tr><th>Intelligence:</th><td>Average (8-10)</td></tr><tr><th>Treasure:</th><td>I,N</td></tr><tr><th>Alignment:</th><td>Chaotic evil</td></tr><tr><th>No. Appearing:</th><td>1d3</td></tr><tr><th>Armor Class:</th><td>8</td></tr><tr><th>Movement:</th><td>8, Sw 15</td></tr><tr><th>Hit Dice:</th><td>8+4</td></tr><tr><th>THAC0:</th><td>13</td></tr><tr><th>No. of Attacks:</th><td>4</td></tr><tr><th>Damage/Attack:</th><td>1d4 (claw)/1d4 (claw)/1d4 (bite)/3d4 (tail lash)</td></tr><tr><th>Special Attacks:</th><td>Tail crush (3d6), charm</td></tr><tr><th>Special Defenses:</th><td>+2 saving throw vs. magic</td></tr><tr><th>Magic Resistance:</th><td>Nil</td></tr><tr><th>Size:</th><td>M (6'+ long)</td></tr><tr><th>Morale:</th><td>Elite (13)</td></tr><tr><th>XP Value:</th><td>3,000</td></tr></table><p class=\"f\">Koprus are a degenerate race of heat-loving amphibians. Though they possess intelligence and power, their civilization has been in decline for generations.</p><p>The kopru, a man-sized creature with a humanoid upper body, has a smooth head, large eyes, and a tentacled, sphincteral mouth. Its two arms end in webbed, clawed hands, and its sinuous lower body splits into three flukelike, prehensile tails, each capped with a sharp hook. Kopru skin, light tan at the creature's hatching, gradually tums to olive in adulthood and fades to a sickly brown in old age.</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Combat:</b> A kopru eschews weapons, instead attacking with a bite and claws that cause 1d4 points of damage each. A kopru also can use its tails in combat; all three tails attack as one and cause 3d4 points of damage on a successful strike, as the hooks on the tails dig in and hold. The round after hitring an opponent with its tails, the creature draws the victim closer, wrapping its tails around the opponent and beginning to crush. On this and subsequent rounds, crushing automatically causes 3d6 points of damage, though a kopru can choose simply to hold an enemy fast with its tails, inflicting no damage. While the tail crush generally has enough power to kill a victim, a kopru also can bite a held victim automatically.</p><p>The creature seldom uses claws on a held victim, because it needs them to stabilize itself or to attack other opponents. If it does claw a held victim, the kopru gains a +4 bonus to its attack rolls. A victim held by the tails cannot wield weapons or otherwise move except to struggle; a successful bend bars roll frees a held victim. On land, the kopru needs its arms for locomotion, so it cannot attack with them. It can use its tails to hit only targets behind it while out of the water.</p><p>The kopru's most insidious assault is the <i>charm</i> spell it can cast instead of attacking physically. The beast may direct this power at any one opponent within a 30-foot radius. A victim who fails a saving throw vs. death magic becomes totally obedient to the kopru's mental commands. If the target makes a successful saving throw, no other kopru of that pack can charm the character successfully during the encounter. This charm differs from the spell <i>charm person</i> in that the subject acts normally in day-to-day affairs, but obeys the kopru immediately when mentally compelled to do so. The kopru that cast the spell receives immediate mental access to the victim's thoughts and memories. A character can be controlled by only one kopru at a time. Once the creature establishes control, distance does not limit the spell's effects. A kopru can manipulate a charmed mind so the victim acts under its compulsion, then resumes normal life again, unaware of being controlled. A caster can maintain this arrangement indefinitely.</p><p>The charm remains in effect until dispelled with a <i>dispel magic</i> or <i>wish</i> spell or the creature dies. (For purposes of <i>dispel magic</i>, call koprus 9th-level casters.) Because of their affinity to magic, koprus gain a +2 bonus to saving throws vs. magic.</p><p>Koprus hate all intelligent air breathers, especially <a href=\"/appendix/elf\">elves</a>, due to their resistance to charm spells. These creatures take special delight in killing elves; their logic tells them that if one cannot control something, better to kill it than let it go free.</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Habitat/Society:</b> Koprus enjoy making lairs in very hot, wet environments, seeking out quiet grottos and undewater caves.</p><p>In their lairs, koprus live in packs of 3 to 24 (3dQ led by a dominant female. Of all the females in the pack, only the leader lays eggs, twice a year. A clutch includes 2d6 eggs, though only 1d4 immature offspring make it to the hatchling stage.</p><p>Evidence suggests that koprus once boasted a powerful undersea civilizi%on. They mastered magic and psionics and built an extensive culture. But climactic shifts or increased competition from other marine races started these creatures on a descent into barbarism that continues to spiral. Advenrurers tell of finding ruined kopru cities on the ocean floor, filled with exotic treasures and occupied by nighmarish marine life.</p><p>Scholars guess that the kopru ability to read a charmed creature's thoughts may be the last remnant of the psionic abilities so common during their days as a civilized power.</p><p>Koprus view humans as brutes to toy with and control. They stalk strangers that wander into their realm, then attack at the victim's most vulnerable moment. Koprus and <a href=\"/appendix/kna\">knas</a> - natural competitors - still fight constantly. Some sages suggest kopru are related to <a href=\"/appendix/mindflay\">mind flayers</a> as <a href=\"/appendix/merman\">mermen</a> are related to humans.</p>\n","images":["<img src=\"grf/ms.gif\" width=\"150\" height=\"75\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Mystara\" title=\"Mystara\" align=\"right\">","<img src=\"img/kopru.gif\" alt=\"Kopru\" title=\"Kopru\" border=\"0\" width=\"300\" height=\"360\" style=\"text-align:right;\" align=\"right\">","<img src=\"grf/add2_01.gif\" width=\"200\" height=\"56\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Advanced Dungeons & Dragons 2nd Edition\">"],"setting":"Mystara","statblock":{"Kopru":{"Activity Cycle":"Any","Alignment":"Chaotic evil","Armor Class":"8","Climate/Terrain":"Tropical oceans and swamps","Damage/Attack":"1d4 (claw)/1d4 (claw)/1d4 (bite)/3d4 (tail lash)","Diet":"Omnivore","Frequency":"Rare","Hit Dice":"8+4","Intelligence":"Average (8-10)","Magic Resistance":"Nil","Morale":"Elite (13)","Movement":"8, Sw 15","No. Appearing":"1d3","No. of Attacks":"4","Organization":"Pack","Size":"M (6'+ long)","Special Attacks":"Tail crush (3d6), charm","Special Defenses":"+2 saving throw vs. magic","THAC0":"13","Treasure":"I,N","XP Value":"3,000"}},"title":"Kopru"},"sources":["2501"],"statblock_names":[],"title":"Kopru","prev_key":"kobold","next_key":"koroboku","monster_path":"/appendix/kopru"}},"staticQueryHashes":[],"slicesMap":{}}
