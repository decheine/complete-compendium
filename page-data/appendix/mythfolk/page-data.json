They have big, deep-brown eyes and white, brown, or black fur. They are ice-dwellers who live high in the mountains surrounding the ee'aar kingdom on the Arm of the Immortals.</p><p>Mythu�nn folk have a completely different name for themselves, but no outsider can pronounce it. They have their own language, but their voices are too high pitched and fast for humanoid hearing. Some mythu�nn speak the <a href=\"/appendix/eeaar\">ee'aar</a> dialect, which they must speak very slowly. Any man-sized or larger humanoid must make a successful hear noise check to understand the speech of the mythu�nn.</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Habitat/Society:</b> Most mythu�nn are extremely curious, wanting to see everything - and the sooner the better. Mythu�nn sometimes even accompany adventurers of good alignment for brief periods of time. Such adventurous mythu�nn quickly learn the language of their &ldquo;Big Folk&rdquo; friends so that they can communicate. Ee'aar travelers often carry mythu�nn for good luck.</p><p>Mythu�nn are sociable and dwell in icy caves high on the mountain-tops. Their wondrous villages are carved and shaped from the ice - miniature fairy-villages, sparkling like cut diamond in the light. Mythu�nn protect their villages with patrols, each carrying a horn to sound an alert if necessary. A village can contain several hundred mythu�nn.</p><p>Individual mythu�nn carry little or no treasure. However, their villages contain at least a full treasure type A.</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Ecology:</b> <a href=\"/appendix/tyminid\">Tyminids</a> prey upon mythu�nn, pursuing the tiny folk relentlessly. Mythu�nn folk sometime hide in <a href=\"/appendix/golesaco\">aeldar</a> webs to elude these predators.</p><p>Mythu�nn live fast - about ten times as fast as most humanoids. A one year sojourn to see the world with a &ldquo;Big Folk&rdquo; friend seems like a decade to one of the adventurous mythu�nn. They live eight to ten years, although to them it seems like 80 to 100 years.</p><p>Mythu�nn mate for life; if one partner dies, the other partner then sickens and dies. A mated pair of mythu�nn will have three to five offspring during their fertile years. Twins are fairly common.</p><br clear=\"all\" style=\"clear:both; height:0;\">\r\n","images":["<img src=\"grf/rs.gif\" width=\"150\" height=\"75\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Red Steel (Mystara)\" title=\"Red Steel (Mystara)\" align=\"right\">","<img src=\"img/mythfolk.gif\" alt=\"Mythu�nn Folk\" title=\"Mythu�nn Folk\" border=\"0\" width=\"300\" height=\"360\" style=\"text-align:right;\" align=\"right\">","<img src=\"grf/add2_01.gif\" width=\"200\" height=\"56\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Advanced Dungeons & Dragons 2nd Edition\">"],"setting":"Red Steel (Mystara)","statblock":{"Mythu�nn Folk":{"Activity Cycle":"Any","Alignment":"Any good","Armor Class":"3","Climate/Terrain":"Any arctic or mountain-top","Damage/Attack":"1d2","Diet":"Omnivore","Frequency":"Rare","Hit Dice":"&#189;","Intelligence":"Average (8-10)","Magic Resistance":"Nil","Morale":"Steady (11-12)","Movement":"6","No. Appearing":"2d4","No. of Attacks":"1","Organization":"Village","Size":"T (6-9&rdquo; tall)","Special Attacks":"Nil","Special Defenses":"Invisibility, <i>dimension door</i>","THAC0":"20","Treasure":"Nil (A)","XP Value":"65"}},"title":"Mythu�nn Folk"},"sources":["2524"],"statblock_names":[],"title":"Mythu�nn Folk","prev_key":"myconid","next_key":"naga","monster_path":"/appendix/mythfolk"}},"staticQueryHashes":[],"slicesMap":{}}
