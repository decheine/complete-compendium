While the powers listed above are the most common, some aarakocra have different or additional powers.</p><p class=\"f\">A race of intelligent, birdlike creatures living in the deepest deserts of Athas, the rare Athasian <a href=\"/appendix/aarakocr\">aarakocra</a> spends its time soaring on thermals in search of food.</p><p>The aarakocra is 7 to 8 feet tall with a wingspan of 20 feet or more. Because of its large wingspan, an aarakocra can carry as much as 75% of its own body weight and still fly easily. An aarakocra can fly a short distance carrying a burden equaling 125% of its own body weight. The average body weight of a full grown male is 100 pounds and a female is 85 pounds.</p><p>Each wing has a &ldquo;hand&rdquo; at its midpoint, consisting of three fingers and an opposable thumb. The fourth finger forms the rigid leading edge of the wing. In flight the hands cannot be used, but on the ground the aarakocra can use its hands almost as a human would. The aarakocra's body is protected by a thin bony plate on the chest, much like a solid rib cage. Talons on its legs can be used as claws and can be retracted to reveal a second set of hands, also with three fingers and an opposable thumb. Except for the chest plate, the entire skeleton is hollow and extremely fragile.</p><p>From a distance, the Athasian aarakocra resembles a huge <a href=\"/appendix/bird\">vulture</a>. Its black eyes, set in the front of the head, provide excellent vision over a long range. The plumage is generally black with a white collar for adult males and black or brown with a smaller white collar for females. Adolescents are a mixture of brown and black. The beak is large and covers most of the head. Plumage begins at the crown of the head and is darker near the head, except for the collar. Athasian aarakocra speak their own language and the languages of vultures and other large birds. Some speak the common tongue (5% to 10% chance depending on how deep in the wastelands a tribe lives).</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Combat:</b> Aarakocra can fight in the air or on the ground. They prefer aerial combat since their bones are too fragile to withstand a solid blow from a human-sized opponent. In combat against creatures on the ground, they prefer to fly over their victim and drop weighted nets. Some aarakocra use darts to harass ground-based opponents.</p><p>If their opponents can fly, the aarakocra generally forgo the use of the net, although large groups sometimes use nets on flying creatures. Normally, aarakocra attack flying creatures with long spears, diving from above and allowing the momentum to carry the spear through the target. Such an attack doubles the damage if the aarakocra have been able to dive at least 50 feet. Only the very largest aarakocra can carry more than one of these spears, they can attack with both at once with no penalty, causing double damage on each strike. All diving attacks are made at +4 and should be treated as a charge attack. All other penalties and restrictions of charge attacks apply.</p><p>The effect of the aarakocra's nets depends on if the opponent is flying at the time it becomes entangled. Creatures on the ground that are hit by a net are entangled and unable to participate in any combat until they make a successful Strength check to get free of the net. Flying creatures hit by a net can no longer fly and immediately begin falling. If they cannot escape the net or use some magical means to arrest the fall, normal falling damage applies.</p><p>Unless victims are entangled in nets, aarakocra are cautious in ground combat. If the aarakocra outnumber their opponents they advance in a straight line and thrust with their spears. If outnumbered, or the opponents are particularly tough, the aarakocra withdraw. Victims entangled in nets are killed or incapacitated for use as food or ransom.</p><p>Athasian aarakocra are mindful of their physical limitations as well as their comparatively low psionic abilities. They do not normally initiate psionic combat. At the first sign of psionic powers from any of their victims, however, all aarakocra that have some ability will use whatever attack and defense modes they can in an attempt to destroy the threat. Large groups of is or more aarakocra may initiate psionic combat if their leaders feel they can win quickly and avoid physical combat.</p><p>In desperation, an aarakocra can attempt to bite an opponent in combat. Because of the unwieldiness of its beak, the aarakocra has a THAC0 of 18 if attacking with this appendage. Further, the birdman causes only 1d2 points of damage with the beak.</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Habitat/Society:</b> Athasian aarakocra live in tribes with 6-20 (2d8+4) members, depending on the prestige of the leader. The largest tribe ever recorded had 50 members. The tribal hunting territory depends on the size of the tribe, usually about 500 square miles for a tribe of 10 members. There are no rigid boundaries between tribes and border disputes are not uncommon.</p><p>Alignments of tribe members are similar to the alignment of the leader. A tribe that has a leader who is neutral good may have neutral good, chaotic good, lawful good, and true neutral members. A predominantly evil tribe does not recognize boundaries with other tribes and treats other tribes as inferior beings to be eliminated.</p><p>Athasian aarakocra aren't happy in enclosed spaces, but they they take refuge in a cave or building if necessary.</p><p>Nonevil tribes live in rocky aeries in the highest peaks they can find. Evil tribes are normally nomadic and use an aerie made by another tribe if they need to remain in an area for a long time, even if they have to evict the tribe that made the nest.</p><p>Aarakocra aren't friendly toward intruders in their territory, especially caravans. They try to extract a toll from the caravan for passage through the desert. Good-aligned tribes allow unhindered passage of caravans that pay a tribute. If someone refuses to pay the tribute, the aarakocra try to capture scouts or outriders from the party and hold them until an even larger tribute is paid. The payment may be either livestock or shiny objects. Aarakocra are smart enough not to be taken in by glass baubles instead of gems, although they cannot tell the difference between the more common gems and the rare ones.</p><p>Evil tribes ask for tribute and often attack a caravan whether it pays or not. Aarakocra always demand shiny objects such as stones. These tribes find humans and demihumans to be quite tasty and prefer them to other food.</p><p>Good-aligned tribes of aarakocra sometimes return a lost traveler to the edge of the desert after first removing any valuables the traveler may be carrying. On very rare occasions a tribe might return a lost group of travelers to the more frequently traveled parts of the desert, again after first taking any valuables as payment.</p><p>The oldest male is the leader of the tribal hunting party and has 4+4 Hit Dice. The oldest female is in charge of the tribal aerie and has 3+3 HD. In tribes that have more than 15 members, the next oldest aarakocra serves as shaman and has 3+3 HD; the shaman completes the triumvirate necessary for proper worship and the summoning of elementals. (Interestingly, no magic-using aarakocra has ever been recorded.) Tribes without a shaman cannot summon <a href=\"/appendix/element1\">air elementals</a>, which is an important part of aarakocra culture.</p><p>The shaman is the leader of the daily sun worship. Aarakocra worship the sun because it provides them with the thermals they need to soar in search of food. The shaman also leads the mystic rituals used to summon an air elemental. Summoning an air elemental is usually done only in preparation for the tribe's most sacred ceremony, the hunt. Small tribes must band together for this ceremony to allow the triumvirate to be formed.</p><p>The ceremony to summon an air elemental must be conducted at dawn and requires the oldest male and female to emit a highpitched keening whistle. The shaman conducts an intricate dance around them, simultaneously chanting an ancient summoning mantra.</p><p>The hunt is the final part of the initiation of adolescent aarakocra to adulthood and often takes the tribe far from their normal teritory. The target is always a <a href=\"/appendix/drakalsi\">silt drake</a>. The hunt is the only time the females leave the relative safety of the nest. Even an evil tribe will not interfere with a tribe on a hunt. An air elemental is often summoned to help find the drake, but never takes part in the actual combat. Although the adult members of the tribe take part in the initial phases of the combat, it is the initiates who deliver the final, killing blows to me drake. Scars from the hunt are considered a mark of pride among all aarakocra.</p><p>The females spend about eight months of the year incubating their eggs. Athasian aarakocra mate for life and a pair normally produces as many as 10 offspring. A female lays one egg a year. Constant incubation is not required because of the high daytime temperatures, so the females can maintain the nest and keep the tribe's treasure in order.</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Ecology:</b> Athasian aarakocra are high on the food chain and have no natural enemies other than <a href=\"/appendix/drakatha\">drakes</a>. Unless evil, aarakocra leave their own territory only to hunt the silt drake and return as soon as possible when the hunt is over. (Evil aarakocra attack others, as noted above.) Aarakocra eggs and hatchlings are sought after by wealthy land owners who wish to use the creatures as scouts and sentries. An egg can bring as much as 10 cp in Tyr's marketplace. Tribes that have had eggs or hatchlings stolen have long memories and sometimes take revenge against the thief at a later date. Captive aarakocra join any tribe they come in contact with.</p><p>Athasian aarakocra have a natural life span of 21-30 years.</p><p></p><br clear=\"all\" style=\"clear:both; height:0;\">\r\n","images":["<img src=\"grf/ds.gif\" width=\"150\" height=\"75\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Dark Sun\" title=\"Dark Sun\" align=\"right\">","<img src=\"img/aarakath.gif\" alt=\"Aarakocra (Athas)\" title=\"Aarakocra (Athas)\" border=\"0\" width=\"300\" height=\"360\" style=\"text-align:right;\" align=\"right\">","<img src=\"grf/add2_01.gif\" width=\"200\" height=\"56\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Advanced Dungeons & Dragons 2nd Edition\">"],"setting":"Dark Sun","statblock":{"Aarakocra (Athas)":{"Activity Cycle":"Day","Alignment":"Any","Armor Class":"7","Climate/Terrain":"Deep desert","Damage/Attack":"1d3/1d3 or by weapon","Diet":"Carnivore","Frequency":"Rare","Hit Dice":"2+2","Intelligence":"Average (8-10)","Magic Resistance":"Nil","Morale":"Steady (11)","Movement":"6, Fl 36 (C)","No. Appearing":"1d10","No. of Attacks":"2","Organization":"Tribal","Size":"M (20'+ wingspan)","Special Attacks":"Nil","Special Defenses":"Nil","THAC0":"17","Treasure":"Varies","XP Value":"65"}},"title":"Aarakocra (Athas)"},"sources":["2433"],"statblock_names":[],"title":"Aarakocra (Athas)","prev_key":"zygraat","next_key":"aarakocr","monster_path":"/appendix/aarakath"}}},"pageContext":{"monster_key":"hagseagr","monster_data":{"TSR":["9575"],"fullBody":"  <table cellspacing=\"0\" cellpadding=\"0\"><tr><th>Climate/Terrain:</th><td>Any aquatic</td></tr><tr><th>Frequency:</th><td>Very rare</td></tr><tr><th>Organization:</th><td>Solitary</td></tr><tr><th>Activity Cycle:</th><td>Any</td></tr><tr><th>Diet:</th><td>Carnivore</td></tr><tr><th>Intelligence:</th><td>Very (11-12)</td></tr><tr><th>Treasure:</th><td>B,C,Y</td></tr><tr><th>Alignment:</th><td>Chaotic evil</td></tr><tr><th>No. Appearing:</th><td>1</td></tr><tr><th>Armor Class:</th><td>5</td></tr><tr><th>Movement:</th><td>Swim 15</td></tr><tr><th>Hit Dice:</th><td>2-8</td></tr><tr><th>THAC0:</th><td>19 (2 HD)<br>17 (3 &amp; 4 HD)<br>15 (5 &amp; 6 HD)<br>13 (7 &amp; 8 HD)</td></tr><tr><th>No. of Attacks:</th><td>1</td></tr><tr><th>Damage/Attack:</th><td>1d4+6 (dagger or claw) or 1d6+6 (short sword)</td></tr><tr><th>Special Attacks:</th><td>Ogre strength (+3 to attack rolls, +6 damage), <i>charm gaze</i>, ghastly visage, spells</td></tr><tr><th>Special Defenses:</th><td><i>Change self</i>, immune to charms, spells</td></tr><tr><th>Magic Resistance:</th><td>50%</td></tr><tr><th>Size:</th><td>M (3' tall plus 3-foot tail)</td></tr><tr><th>Morale:</th><td>Champion (15)</td></tr><tr><th>XP Value:</th><td>2 Dice: 975<br>3 Hit Dice: 1,400<br>4 Hit Dice: 2,000<br>5 Hit Dice: 3,000<br>6 Hit Dice: 4,000<br>7 Hit Dice: 5,000<br>8 Hit Dice: 6,000</td></tr></table><p class=\"f\">One of the most dreaded denizens of the deep, greater sea <a href=\"/appendix/hag\">hags</a> are fortunately rare. They are thought by some to have descended from twisted servitor creations of <a href=\"/appendix/archomee\">Olhydra</a>, princess of evil water creatures and ruler over the Plane of Elemental Water (which in turn argues that lesser sea hags, and perhaps all other hags, are merely degenerate descendants of greater sea hags).</p><p>They appear as wrinkled, withered old crones with seaweed-green hair that covers their green-scaled bodies, iron-like claws, and fiery red eyes. Some can't be distinguished from lesser sea hags, but others are noticeably larger and more charismatic.</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Combat:</b> Though they lack the death gaze power of their lesser kin, greater sea hags can work a powerful <i>charm</i> three times a day by making eye contact with an intelligent creature. Those so <i>charmed</i> remain in this state until the hag is killed or the <i>charm</i> is magically dispelled; victims do not get additional saves as time passes. Greater sea hags are themselves immune to all <i>charm</i>, <i>suggestion</i>, and other mind-influencing magics or psionics.</p><p>A greater sea hag can cast <i>change self</i> so as to resemble any sea creature, usually choosing one as beautiful as she is ugly, such as a <a href=\"/appendix/merman\">mermaid</a> or <a href=\"/appendix/elekwate\">nereid</a>. This disguise is often used to deceive seafarers into following a dangerous course - onto rocks, reefs, or other hazards - and causing their vessels to be wrecked. The hag then seizes any sunken treasure and devours the drowned seamen at will. The true appearance of a greater sea hag is so ghastly that anyone viewing it must make a saving throw vs. spell or lose half his or her Strength for 1d6 turns.</p><p>Greater sea hags are most greatly feared, however, for their magic use. They possess the spellcasting abilities of mages equal in level to their own Hit Dice. The following spells are ones typically used by greater sea hags, although they may know any spells of appropriate level listed in the <i>Player's Handbook</i>. DMs interested in underwater spellcasting may wish to consult the appropriate chapter in <i>DMGR9, Of Ships and the Sea</i>.</p><p>1st level: <i>audible glamer</i>, <i>dancing lights</i>, <i>enlarge</i>, <i>expeditious retreat</i>*, <i>magic missile</i>, <i>phantasmal force</i>, <i>protection from good</i>, <i>shield</i>, <i>shocking grasp</i>, <i>sleep</i>, <i>taunt</i>, <i>tears of the crocodile</i>**, <i>ventriloquism</i>.</p><p>2nd level: <i>blindness</i>, <i>blur</i>, <i>darkness 15' radius</i>, <i>detect good</i>, <i>ESP</i>, <i>invisibility</i>, <i>know alignment</i>, <i>levitate</i>, <i>locate object</i>, <i>mirror image</i>, <i>ray of enfeeblement</i>, <i>shatter</i>, <i>stinking cloud</i>, <i>web</i>.</p><p>3rd level: <i>blink</i>, <i>clairaudience</i>, <i>clairvoyance</i>, <i>dispel magic</i>, <i>haste</i>, <i>hold person</i>, <i>lightning bolt</i>, <i>monster summoning I</i>, <i>protection from normal missiles</i>, <i>slow</i>, <i>spectral force</i>, <i>suggestion</i>, <i>tongues</i>.</p><p>4th level: <i>charm monster</i>, <i>confusion</i>, <i>curse</i>, <i>dimension door</i>, <i>emotion</i>, <i>enervation</i>, <i>Evard's black tentacles</i>, <i>improved invisibility</i>, <i>minor globe of invulnerability</i>, <i>monster summoning II</i>, <i>phantasmal killer</i>, <i>plant growth</i>, <i>polymorph other</i>, <i>polymorph self</i>, <i>shout</i>, <i>wizard eye</i>.</p><p class=\"ni\">* spell from <i>Player's Option: Spells &amp; Magic</i>.<br>** spell from <i>Of Ships and the Sea</i>.</p><p>A rare few greater sea hags are psionic wild talents. Such individuals always have unpredictable powers, not the abilities exhibited by a being who has developed personal psionic abilities in the usual manner.</p><p>If they must battle an opponent directly (something they tend to avoid), greater sea hags use daggers or short swords. When making any physical attack, their great strength (18/00) allows them a +3 bonus to the attack roll and a +6 damage bonus.</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Habitat/Society:</b> Greater sea hags usually lair in undersea caves filled with the spoils they have salvaged from sunken vessels; sometimes they claim captain's cabins of those ships if the chambers are lavish enough. Much of their time is spent grinding salt through the use of magical rock-crushing devices; greater sea hags derive essential sustenance from sea salt. When not grinding salt or hunting prey, greater sea hags seek to enrich their treasure hoards, often with the help of charmed helpers or evil aquatic creatures. They take pride in knowing their undersea surroundings well and can often spot concealed or magically disguised intruders or newly-arrived items by the change in familiar seafloor topography. On the other hand, greater sea hags won't hesitate to boldly strike forth into new territories, making long forays into strange seas. The waters of the Fire River, flowing out into the Sea of Fallen Stars, seem to attract greater sea hags. In general, they favor regions having &ldquo;interesting&rdquo; sea bottoms, such as reefs, underwater crags and rifts, and ship graveyards adorned with lots of wrecks.</p><p class=\"f\"><b>Ecology:</b> Greater sea hags are thankfully rare and seldom reproduce, being jealous and suspicious of all other life. They sometimes dwell with their lesser kin but never seem to take part in coveys. They can live for as long as a thousand years and speak the tongues of <a href=\"/appendix/elfaquat\">sea elves</a>, their own language, and annis (the hag languages). Danger and strong foes seem to attract them, and they serve as the ultimate predator of human-sized or smaller opponents. Most <a href=\"/appendix/shark\">sharks</a> avoid sea hags, having learned the bite of their fell magic.</p><p></p><br clear=\"all\" style=\"clear:both; height:0;\">\r\n","images":["<img src=\"grf/fr.gif\" width=\"150\" height=\"75\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Forgotten Realms\" title=\"Forgotten Realms\" align=\"right\">","<img src=\"img/hagseagr.gif\" alt=\"Hag, Sea, Greater\" title=\"Hag, Sea, Greater\" border=\"0\" width=\"300\" height=\"360\" style=\"text-align:right;\" align=\"right\">","<img src=\"grf/add2_01.gif\" width=\"200\" height=\"56\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Advanced Dungeons & Dragons 2nd Edition\">"],"setting":"Forgotten Realms","statblock":{"Hag, Sea, Greater":{"Activity Cycle":"Any","Alignment":"Chaotic evil","Armor Class":"5","Climate/Terrain":"Any aquatic","Damage/Attack":"1d4+6 (dagger or claw) or 1d6+6 (short sword)","Diet":"Carnivore","Frequency":"Very rare","Hit Dice":"2-8","Intelligence":"Very (11-12)","Magic Resistance":"50%","Morale":"Champion (15)","Movement":"Swim 15","No. Appearing":"1","No. of Attacks":"1","Organization":"Solitary","Size":"M (3' tall plus 3-foot tail)","Special Attacks":"Ogre strength (+3 to attack rolls, +6 damage), <i>charm gaze</i>, ghastly visage, spells","Special Defenses":"<i>Change self</i>, immune to charms, spells","THAC0":"19 (2 HD)<br>17 (3 &amp; 4 HD)<br>15 (5 &amp; 6 HD)<br>13 (7 &amp; 8 HD)","Treasure":"B,C,Y","XP Value":"2 Dice: 975<br>3 Hit Dice: 1,400<br>4 Hit Dice: 2,000<br>5 Hit Dice: 3,000<br>6 Hit Dice: 4,000<br>7 Hit Dice: 5,000<br>8 Hit Dice: 6,000"}},"title":"Hag, Sea, Greater"},"sources":["9575"],"statblock_names":[],"title":"Hag, Sea, Greater","prev_key":"hagbheur","next_key":"hagspect","monster_path":"/appendix/hagseagr"}},"staticQueryHashes":[],"slicesMap":{}}
